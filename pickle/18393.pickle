VTheres only two JPA providers I'd consider using:
p4
aVIf you want to stick to standard JPA I'd use EclipseLink
p5
aVWhereas Toplink Essentials is the reference implementation of JPA 1
p6
aV0, EclipseLink basically inherited the TopLink Essentials code and will be the reference implementation of JPA 2
p7
aV0 (and bundled with Glassfish V3 when it ships; expected around JavaOne in May 2009)
p8
aVTopLink Essentials was a somewhat crippled version of Oracle's commercial TopLink product but EclipseLink basically has all the features TopLink has
p9
aVThe other choice is obviously Hibernate
p10
aVIts widely used and mature but is not issue free from what I've seen
p11
aVFor example, last I looked Hibernate has issues with an entity having multiple one-to-many eager relationships
p12
aVI don't know if Hibernate has an equivalent to EclipseLink's batch query hint, but its an incredibly useful feature to deal with this kind of problem
p13
aVHibernate of course also supports standard JPA
p14
aVThe biggest advantage of Hibernate is that if you have question about how it works a google search is likely to find you an answer
p15

VIn theory, you can't deterministically find unused code
p30
aVTheres a mathematical proof of this (well, this is a special case of a more general theorem)
p31
aVIf you're curious, look up the Halting Problem
p32
aVThis can manifest itself in Java code in many ways:
p33
aVLoading classes based on user input, config files, database entries, etc;
p34
aVLoading external code;
p35
aVPassing object trees to third party libraries;

VYou're going to have to do this as a separate query, for example:
p45
aVSome JDBC drivers might tell you but this is optional behaviour and, more to the point, the driver may not know yet
p46
aVThis can be due to how the query is optimised eg two example execution strategies in Oracle are to get all rows as quickly as possible or to get the first row as quickly as possible
p47
aVIf you do two separate queries (one a count and the other the query) then you'll need to do them within the same transaction
p48
aVThis will work well on Oracle but can be problematic on other databases (eg SQL Server will either show you uncommitted data or block on an external uncommitted update depending on your isolation level whereas Oracle supports an isolation level that gives you a transactionally consistent view of the data without blocking on external updates)
p49
aVNormally though it doesn't really matter how many rows there are
p50
aVTypically this sort of query is either batch processed or paged and either way you have progress information in the form of rows loaded/processed and you can detect the end of the result set (obviously)

VYou're being unnecessarily verbose
p57
aVFor one thing, getResultList() doesn't throw an exception when no rows are returned (at least not in Eclipse or Toplink--I can't imagine another provider being any different)
p58
aVgetSingleResult() does, getResultList() doesn't
p59
aVAlso, you can use the builder pattern so:
p60
aVshould be sufficient to return a List of results if there are any or an empty List if there are none
p61
aVTwo things to note:
p62
aV@SuppressWarnings("unchecked") is unnecessary but it gets rid of an otherwise unavoidable warning when casting the non-generic List result from getResultList() to a generic List; and
p63
aVIt's probably worth replacing the createQuery() call with a @NamedQuery on MyEnt (typically)

VSpeaking from experience at writing this kind of thing, it's really difficult to do with 100% reliability
p72
aVI've written some Java code to do this that is reasonably good at processing the data we have but won't be applicable in every country
p73
aVQuestions you need to ask are:
p74
aVAre the character to number mappings consistent between countries
p75
aVThe US uses a lot of this (eg 1800-GOT-MILK) but in Australia, as one example, its pretty rare
p76
aVWhat you'd need to do is ensure that you were doing the correct mapping for the country in question if it varies (it might not)
p77
aVI don't know what countries that use different alphabets (eg Cyrilic in Russia and the former Eastern block countries) do;
p78
aVYou have to accept that your solution will not be 100% and you should not expect it to be
p79
aVYou need to take a "best guess" approach
p80
aVFor example, theres no real way of knowing that 132345 is a valid phone number in Australia, as is 1300 123 456 but that these are the only two patterns that are for 13xx numbers and they're not callable from overseas;
p81
aVYou also have to ask if you want to validate regions (area codes)
p82
aVI believe the US uses a system where the second digit of the area code is a 1 or a 0
p83
aVThis may have once been the case but I'm not sure if it still applies
p84
aVWhatever the case, many other countries will have other rules
p85
aVIn Australia, the valid area codes for landlines and mobile (cell) phones are two digits (the first is 0)
p86
aV08, 03 and 04 are all valid
p87
aV01 isn't
p88
aVHow do you cater for that
p89
aVDo you want to
p90
aVCountries use different conventions no matter how many digits they're writing
p91
aVYou have to decide if you want to accept something other than the "norm"
p92

p109
aVAnd thats just off the top of my head
p110
aVFor one country
p111
aVIn France, for example, its common the write the phone number in number pairs (12 34 56 78) and they pronounce it that way too: instead of:

aVun (one), deux (two), trois (three),
p113
aVits
p114
aVdouze (twelve), trente-quatre (thirty four),
p115
aVDo you want to cater for that level of cultural difference
p116
aVI would assume not but the question is worth considering just in case you make your rules too strict
p117

aVThe first is evaluated at compile-time
p146
aVThe second is evaluated at run-time
p147
aVSo never replace constant concatenations (of any type) with StringBuilder, StringBuffer or the like

aVOnly use those where variables are invovled and generally only when you're appending a lot of operands or you're appending in a loop
p149

p152
aVHowever some might be tempted to optimise:
p153
aVinto this:
p154
aVWhile this is well-intentioned, the bottom line is DON'T
p155
aVWhy
p156
aVAs another answer correctly pointed out: the compiler does this for you
p157
aVSo in doing it yourself, you're not allowing the compiler to optimise the code or not depending if its a good idea, the code is harder to read and its unnecessarily complicated
p158
aVFor low-level optimisation the compiler is better at optimising code than you are
p159
aVLet the compiler do its job
p160
aVIn this case the worst case scenario is that the compiler implicitly changes your code to exactly what you wrote
p161
aVConcatenating 2-3 Strings might be more efficient than constructing a StringBuilder so it might be better to leave it as is

VI, like you, started out with the Spring helper classes for Jasper Reports but quickly abandoned them as being too coarse-grained and inflexible, which is unusual for Spring
p169
aVIts like they were added as an afterthought
p170
aVThe big problem I had with them was that once they were compiled, it required an appserver bounce to put in new versions
p171
aVIn my case, I was after a solution whereby I could change them on disk and they'd recompile, much like how JSPs normally work (if you don't turn this feature off, which many production sites would)
p172
aVAlternatively, I wanted to be able to store the jrxml files in a database or run the reports remotely (eg through the JasperServer web services interface)
p173
aVThe Spring classes just made it all but impossible to implement such features
p174
aVSo my suggestion to you is: roll your own
p175
aVThere are a couple of gotchas along the way though, which I'll share with you to minimize the pain
p176
aVSome of these things aren't obvious from the documentation
p177
aVThe first thing you'll need is a jasper reports compiler
p178
aVThis is responsible for compiling a jrxml file into a JasperDesign object
p179
aVThere are several implemenations of this but the one you want is the JRJdtCompiler
p180
aVYou can instantiate and inject this in a Spring application context
p181
aVAvoid others like the beanshell compiler since running the report as a large beanshell script is not particularly fast or efficient (I found this out the hard way before I knew any better)
p182
aVYou will need to include the jar files for the JRJdtCompiler
p183
aVI think the full Jasper Reports dist includes this jar
p184
aVIts an eclipse product
p185
aVYou can store the JasperDesign anywhere you like (HttpSession, servlet context or whatever)
p186
aVThe fillReport() method is the primary one you're interested in
p187
aVIt creates a JasperPrint object, which is an instance of a run report
p188
aVParameters are just passed in as a Map
p189
aVNow to create a versino in HTML, PDF, etc, you need to export it
p190
aVYou use classes like the JRHtmlExporter and JRPdfExporter to do this
p191
aVThey require certain parameters
p192
aVThe tricky one is the HTML exporter because HTML obviously doesn't include the images
p193
aVJasper includes an ImageServlet class that fetches these from the session (where the JRHtmlExporter has put them) but you have to get the config of both the HTML exporter and image servlet just right and its hard to tell where you're going wrong
p194
aVI don't remember the specifics of it but theres an example of all this in the Jasper Reports Definitive Guide, which I'd highly recommend you get if you're spending anytime at all with this product
p195
aVIts fairly cheap at US$50
p196
aVYou could get the annual subscription too but in the 18+ months I've seen it I haven't seen a single change
p197
aVJust buy the new version when it comes out if you need it (which you probably won't)

p205
aVThe correct solution is to use Bresenham's Line Algorithm between the two points and to see if the third point is one of the points on the line

aVIts easy to understand what the values are by looking at them and, where necessary, conversion to radians is trivial
p391
aVCalculations on latitudes and longitudes such as the Great Circle distance between two coordinates rely heavily on trigonometric functions, which typically use doubles
p392
aVAny other format is going to rely on another implementation of sine, cosine, atan2 and square root, at a minimum
p393
aVArbitrary precision numbers (eg BigDecimal in Java) won't work for this
p394
aVSomething like the int where 2^32 is spread uniformly is going to have similar issues

VTheres no reason you can't use PHP for large projects
p419
aVAfter all, Facebook is built on PHP
p420
aVThere will be issues however but there are issues with any large project
p421
aVWhat makes PHP so pervasive is the low barrier to entry and cheap hosting
p422
aVIt runs as an Apache extension and you can pretty much just start coding
p423
aVIf you go to more enterprise platforms such as
p424
aVNet or Java, they have a much higher barrier to entry but they also come with a lot of infrastructure to help you make applications that scale
p425
aVFor example, the database abstraction in PHP is (imho) woeful
p426
aVIt's vendor specific
p427
aVWith MySQL, people tend to do things like:
p428
aVwhich is bad for several reasons:
p429
aVIt makes poor use of the query cache;
p430
aVIt doesn't handle escaping of characters (which, of course, can be done with  but you'll be surprised how often people don't do this); and
p431
aVIt's fairly easy to code in such a way as to allow SQL injection attacks
p432
aVPersonally I prefer mysqli for all the above reasons but it has it's own problems: namely that using LONGTEXT fields crashes mysql and has done since at least 2005 with still no fix (yes I and several others have raised a bug)
p433
aVCompare this to Java (with which I'm more familiar) and JPA or Ibatis are vastly better ORM solutions with higher startup costs but they will help you on an enterprise scale
p434
aVSo you're not prohibited from doing large projects on PHP
p435
aVIt's simply harder in that you have to do increasingly more work yourself to replicate what other platforms provide you
p436
aVThat being said, PHP + memcached/APC + beanstalkd goes a long way
p437
aVOh that's the other problem: PHP doesn't really support background processing or threading
p438

p447
aVI tend to use PL/SQL Developer
p448
aVIt has some good options to generate scripts from an existing database
p449
aVOnce you have these you can run the scripts using sqlplus or any application code that can execute arbitrary SQL (eg JDBC with Java)
p450
aVToad is the more common (and more expensive) tool for Oracle development
p451
aVThe only limitation of a SQL export is it can't export CLOB/BLOB fields
p452
aVIf you have those, you either need to do them separately (as a PL/SQL export) or do the whole thing as a PL/SQL export
p453
aVTheres no dramas with this except the file is effectively a binary export (extension
p454
aVpde) and is more limited in how you can execute it
p455
aVThe other big advantage of SQL source files is they can be version controlled easily
p456
aVIt's really handy to be able to create a database environment by running one or two scripts
p457
aVThe import and export tools for Oracle I think are more applicable for backup and restore operations
p458
aVNow, as for delivering that to a customer, from your comments it seems that you'll be giving this to DBAs
p459
aVPretty much any Oracle installation will have DBAs involved
p460
aVThey will be fine with SQL scripts to create the schema and do the data load
p461
aVThey will be doing a lot of site-specific configuration (eg tuning the SGA, temp tablespaces, # of concurrent connections, etc based on expected load)
p462
aVYou, as the vendor, can give guidance on any relevant configuration and you may get involved in support and possibly installation but ultimately it's up to them to figure out what works for them
p463
aVOracle runs on a large number of operating systems and hardware variants with infinite variations in network topology and firewall configuraiton
p464
aVYou can't factor in all of these to an installer or even a set of instructions (other than the guidelines mentioned previously)

p488

p690

p691
aVThere can be only one instance of an attribute although you can enforce this with elements using DTD or XML Schema;
p692
aVAttributes are unordered
p693
aVElements are not;
p694

aVto:

p698
aVNot really relevant now since DTDs aren't used much (if at all) over XML Schema but I'll add it anyway: DTDs allow default values (implied) for attributes but no such mechanism for elements; and
p699
aVElements, being elementss, can have children and attributes of their own
p700
aVAttributes obviously cannot
p701
aVSo, from your example, your innermost  element has a URL attribute (although it's an image for some reason--perhaps a preview icon
p702
aVIf so the attribute name is misleading)
p703
aVA webpage only has one URL (generally) so that'd be a good example of something that could be an attribute

p725
aVYou can:
p726
aVExport services using RMI:

aVprobably the simplest approach;
p728
aVUse HTTP invoker: if remote access is an issue, this might be better for firewalls, etc than pure RMI; or
p729
aVUse Web Services, in which case I would favour JAX-WS over JAX-RPC
p730
aVSpring has the additional benefit in that it can do the wiring for both the server and the client, easily and transparently
p731
aVPersonally I would choose either (2) or (3)
p732
aVHTTP is network friendly
p733
aVIt's easy to deploy in a Web container
p734
aVJetty's long-lived connections give you the option over server push (effectively) over HTTP
p735
aVAll of these methods allow complex objects to be sent across the wire but they are subtly different in this regard
p736
aVYou need to consider if your server and client are going to be distributed separately and whether it's an issue if you change the interface that you need to redistribute the class files
p737
aVOr you can use a customized serialization solution (even XML) to avoid this
p738
aVBut that has issues as well
p739

aVAlways send an HTML and a pure text version this way for mail clients that don't support HTML or some people just turn off HTML in emails (there are security/spam isssues with images although a lot of clients won't auto-download images from non-trusted sites anyway);
p809
aVImages can be included in the message instead of as straight links
p810
aVStraight links save on bandwidth but are a spam or even security issue (eg Internet Explorer had a buffer overrun bug with PNG images)
p811
aVEmbedded images are references with cid values; and
p812
aVOnly use the most basic HTML
p813
aVBrowser HTML support varies from the primitive to the bizarre
p814
aVWhen I looked into doing this we just couldn't get a consistent (or even acceptably different) look and feel on the handful of mail clients we investigated leading us to send our reports as attached PDFs, which are, in a lot of ways, preferable (they can easily be saved, for one)
p815
aVAs to your garbled message, it looks to me that your message isn't being correctly identified as HTML so the mail client is wrapping lines of text at 70 or so characters

aVStill can't do it
p826
aVThis begs the question: do you need to use POST or do you simply want to
p827
aVThe only reason why you'd need to is query string length
p828
aVAs to wanting to, you mention "controlling user input"
p829
aVWhat does that mean exactly
p830
aVYou should never ever ever rely on the browser for input validation
p831
aVYou can do it there as a convenience but the server should always validate input
p832
aVOr is the reason aesthetic (ie shorter, "nicer" URLs)
p833
aVYou're reinventing the wheel that is hyperlinks
p834
aVI'm just trying to make sure you have a pretty darn good reason for doing so because it's counterproductive and you're never going to get the same browser support and compatibility as actual hyperlinks

VI know Java veterans of 5-10+ years who don't realize that  implies package private acess
p843
aVThis alone, for me, makes package private an horrific language feature
p844
aVPersonally I don't think there is any justifiable reason to use package private anyway
p845
aVLet's consider the use cases:
p846
aVPackage private classes: use inner classes
p847
aVAnother poster suggested there is a (small) performance penalty for inner classes vs package private classes but, to me, that's not a good reason for bad design
p848
aVPackage private and inner classes I consider to be implementation details and, as such, I think it's better to "hide" them as inner classes;
p849
aVPackage private data members: I can see no reason for these at all; and
p850
aVPackage private methods: these are pretty much the equivalent of C++ friend methods
p851
aVC++ friends had one good raison d'etre and that was to externalize operator overloading outside of the class, which allowed the first argument to be something other than the class itself
p852
aVIn Java, there is no such use case, which just leaves doing an end-run around encapsulation and abstraction
p853
aVCompare this to protected methods, which are entirely justifiable when designing classes for extension
p854
aVI've seen cases where programmers inadvertently use protected methods in unrelated classes in the same package just because they come up on auto-completion lists
p855
aVAnd there is absolutely no way to prevent this
p856
aVC# has a better access system in that protected doesn't imply internal access
p857
aVBut I consider this--along with a mutable Date class--to be pretty huge flaws

aVA compiler may optimze them into the same form anyway

p872
aVI like style 1 just because the loop has one entry point (per iteration) and one exit point (per iteration) so it's easy to insert debug code at the end of the loop and know it'll get called

VJava is strongly-typed
p933
aVPHP isn't;
p934
aVPHP does a lot of implicit type conversion, which can actually be problematic and is why PHP5 has operators like  and
p935
aVJava's implicit type conversion is primarily limited to auto-boxing of primitive types (PHP has no primitive types)
p936
aVThis often comes up
p937
aVConsider:
p938
aVwhich is incorrect and will have the block not executed because the return index of  is converted to
p939
aVThe correct version is:
p940
aVJava conditional statements require an explicit ;
p941
aVPHP variables and arrays are all prepended by  and otherwise indistinguishable;
p942
aVThe equivalent of PHP associative arrays is PHP  (eg )
p943
aVAssociative arrays are ordered on insertion order and can be used like ordinary arrays (on the values)
p944
aVTheres one  implementation that maintains insertion order in Java but this is the exception rather than the norm;
p945
aVinsert or update an element in an associative array
p946
aVJava must use  and ;
p947
aVPHP5 has the equivalent of function pointers and anonymous functions (using ); 5
p948
aV3 introduces closures at the language level
p949
aVJava must use inner classes for both, which is somewhat more verbose
p950
aVMoreover, inner classes are limited in how they can access variables from the outer scope (read Java Closures on JavaPapers), making them not as powerful as true closures
p951
aVVariable declaration is optional in PHP;
p952
aVUse of global variables within functions requires explicit use of the  keyword in PHP;
p953
aVPOST/GET parameters are, unless configured otherwise () automatically result in global variables of the same name
p954
aVThey can alternatively be accessed via the  global variable (and  for session variables) whereas support for these things comes from a JEE add-on called the servlets API via objects like  and ;
p955
aVFunction declaration in PHP uses the  keyword whereas in Java you declare return types and parameter types;
p956
aVPHP function names can't normally clash whereas Java allows method overloading as long as the different method signatures aren't ambiguous;
p957
aVPHP has default values for function arguments
p958
aVJava doesn't
p959
aVIn Java this is implemented using method overloading
p960
aVPHP supports the missing-method pattern, which is confusingly called "overloading" in the PHP docs
p961
aVCompare:
p962
aVto
p963
aVString constants in PHP are declared using single or double quotes, much like Perl
p964
aVDouble quotes will evaluate variables embedded in the text
p965
aVAll Java String constants use double quotes and have no such variable evaluation;
p966
aVPHP object method calls use the  operator
p967
aVJava uses the  operator;
p968
aVConstructors in Java are named after the class name
p969
aVIn PHP they are called ;
p970
aVIn Java objects,  is implicit and only used to be explicit about scope and in certain cases with inner classes
p971
aVIn PHP5,  is explicit;
p972
aVStatic methods in Java can be called with either the  operator on an instance (although this is discouraged it is syntactically valid) but generally the class name is used instead
p973
aVThese two are equivalent:
p974
aVbut the former is preferred
p975
aVPHP uses the  scope resolution operator for statics;
p976
aVMethod overriding and overloading is quite natural in Java but a bit of a kludge in PHP;
p977
aVPHP code is embedded in what is otherwise largely an HTML document, much like how JSPs work;
p978
aVPHP uses the  operator to append strings
p979
aVJava uses ;
p980
aVJava 5+ methods must use the ellipsis () to declare variable length argument lists explicitly
p981
aVAll PHP functions are variable length;
p982
aVVariable length argument lists are treated as arrays inside method bodies
p983
aVIn PHP you have to use ,  and/or ;

aVJPA is the peristence layer of EJB, not built on EJB;

VHibernate (or any JPA solution) is the wrong tool for this job
p1114
aVJPA/Hibernate isn't a lightweight solution
p1115
aVIn high-volume applications, the overhead is not only significant but prohibitive
p1116
aVYou really need to look into grid and cluster solutions
p1117
aVI won't repeat the overview of the various technologies here
p1118
aVI've got a lot of experience in financial market information systems
p1119
aVA few of the things you said stuck out to me:
p1120
aVYou have a lot of raw data;
p1121
aVYou want to apply various aggregations to that data (eg open/high/low/close daily summaries);
p1122
aVHigh availability is probably an issue (it always is in these kinds of systems); and
p1123
aVLow latency is probably an issue (ditto)
p1124
aVNow for grid/cluster type solutions I divide them loosely into two categories:
p1125
aVMap-based solutions like Coherence or Terracotta; and
p1126
aVJavaspaces-based solutions like GigaSpaces
p1127
aVI've used Coherence a lot and the Map solution can be nice but it can be problematic too
p1128
aVCoherence maps can have listeners on them and you can use this sort of thing to do things like:
p1129
aVMarket price alerts (users may want a notification when a price reaches a certain level);
p1130
aVDerivative pricing (eg an exchange-traded option pricing system will want to reprice when an underlying security changes last traded price);
p1131
aVA trade-matching/booking system may want to match received trade notifications for reconciliation purposes;
p1132
aVetc
p1133
aVAll of these can be done with listeners but in Coherence for example listeners have to be cheap, which leads to things like a Map having a listener than writes something to another Map and this can chain on for awhile
p1134
aVAlso, modifying the cache entry can be problematic (although there are mechanisms for dealing with that kind of problem too; I'm talking about situations like turning off a market price alert so it doesn't trigger a second time)
p1135
aVI found GigaSpaces type grid solutions to be far more compelling for this kind of application
p1136
aVThe read (or destructive read) operation is a highly elegant and scalable solution and you can get transactional grid updates with sub-millisecond performance
p1137
aVConsider the two classic queueing architectures:
p1138
aVRequest/Response: a bad message can block the queue and while you can many senders and receivers (for scalability) scaling up the number of pipes isn't always straightforward; and
p1139
aVPublish/Subscribe: this decouples the sender and receiver but lacks scalability in that if you have multiple subscribers they'll each receive the message (not necessarily what you want with say a booking system)
p1140
aVIn GigaSpaces, a destructive read is like a scalable publish-subscribe system and a read operation is like the traditional publish-subscribe model
p1141
aVThere is a Map and JMS implementation built on top of the grid and it can do FIFO ordering
p1142
aVNow whaqt about persistence I hear you ask
p1143
aVPersistence is a consequence of deciding all the other stuff
p1144
aVFor this kind of application, I like the Persistence as a Service model (ironically written about Hibernate but it applies to anything)
p1145
aVBasically this means your date store hits are asynchronous and it works nicely with doing summary data
p1146
aVLike you can have a service listening for trade notifications and persist just the ones it's interested in (aggregating in memory if required)
p1147
aVYou can do open/high/low/close prices this way
p1148
aVFor high volume data you don't really want to write it all to the database
p1149
aVNot synchronously anyway

p1191
aVBookmarking a page and expecting the results has some merit (eg if I bookmark a quote for GOOG then I should go back there and get a current quote, not the quote I saw at the time I bookmarked, obviously) but a page result can also be costly so this may not always be appropriate
p1192

VI went through a similar thing last year
p1235
aVThere the question was: do we model our entities explicitly or generically
p1236
aVIn your example, that would mean having entities/tables like teacher, student, etc with direct relationships between them or not
p1237
aVIn the end we went for a generic "Party" model
p1238
aVThe Party model is as follows:
p1239
aVA Party represents a person or organisation;
p1240
aVMost Party types had a dependent table to store extra information depending on the party type eg Person, Organization, Company;
p1241
aVThings like Student or Teacher are Party Roles
p1242
aVA Party may have any number of Party Roles
p1243
aVA Person may be both a Teacher and a Student, for example;
p1244
aVThings like classes are handled as Party Role Relationships
p1245
aVFor example, a relationship between a Teacher and Student role indicates a class relationship;
p1246
aVParty Role Relationships can have subtypes for extra information
p1247
aVA Teacher-Student Relationship in your model is an Enrolment and that could have the extra attributes you're talking about;
p1248
aVParties don't have direct relationships with each other
p1249
aVOnly Party Roles relate to each other; and
p1250
aVFor common groupings of information, we created views if it helped because the SQL can be a bit convoluted as the relationships are more indirect (eg there are three tables in between the Party entities for a Teacher and Student)
p1251
aVIt's an extremely powerful model, one that is pretty common in CRM type systems
p1252
aVThis model pretty much came from "The Data Model Resource Book: Volume 1", which is an excellent resource for such things

VI nearly always use Spring in my Java projects and, as such, my objects are built for dependency injection
p1402
aVThey tend to be fairly granular implementations of public interfaces that are assembled within the application context
p1403
aVAs such, I rarely (if ever) have the need to test private methods because the class itself is small enough that it simply isn't an issue

aVEven when I don't use Spring I tend to adopt the same practices of assembling small and simple objects into larger and larger abstractions, each of which is relatively simple but made complex by the aggregated objects

p1507

p1508
aVCan I use a raw type like any other type

VThe underlying protocol for database connections is typically TCP/IP based
p1524

p1525
aVThe server closes it gracefully and receives an acknowledgement from the client;
p1526
aVThe client closes is gracefully and receives an acknowledgement from the server;
p1527
aVThe connection times out
p1528
aVThe client and server both separately are told by their respective operating systems that the connection has been closed;
p1529
aVThe connection is forcefully closed by either side
p1530
aVIn the case of (3), TCP connections must be kept alive by sending dummy messages every so often to avoid a timeout
p1531
aVYour connection may timeout because neither side is doing this (and for a database connection it's not something you typically want to do)
p1532
aVIt's entirely possible for a time for one side to think the connection is closed and hte other side to still believe it is open
p1533
aVMessages may get sent in those cases (and typically discarded)
p1534
aVEach connection ("socket") uses an operating system resource called a file descriptor (in UNIX parlance, your OS may call it something else), which is a handle to an I/O resource and the same thing used for an open file (again, OSs may vary)
p1535
aVThe limit on connections on your database will be the lowest of:
p1536
aVThe configured limit for the OS;
p1537
aVThe maximum file descriptors allowed for that process (minus any being used for I/O activity); and
p1538
aV(possibly) system settings or policies on connection limits
p1539
aVIf the connection isn't TCP based (eg a filesystem socket as is often used with MySQL on UNIX systems) the principles are in fact very simlar
p1540
aVAnyway, the moral of the story to take from this is that a database connection--regardless of its form--involves an operating system resource of some kind
p1541
aVYour program hsa directly or indirectly asked for that resource
p1542
aVIf the program dies, the operating system will reclaim it (perhaps not immediately but eventually)

VThere is a third option:
p1724
aVMinimize or eliminate the need for browser detection and CSS hacks
p1725
aVI try to use things like jQuery plug-ins that take care of any browser differences for you (for widgets and the like)
p1726
aVThis doesn't take care of everything but it does a lot and has delegated the effort of supporting multiple browsers to someone who has spent and will spend far more effort on it than you can afford to or want to
p1727
aVAfter that I follow these princples:
p1728
aVUse what I call minimal CSS, meaning only use features that are widely supported;
p1729
aVUse tables for complex layout if necessary
p1730
aVYou may not like this but frankly to do things like side-by-side layout, tables will work on browsers going back a decade and will be a lot less effort than getting divs to work with combinations of absolute positioning, floating and the like;
p1731
aVForce IE6 into strict rather than quirks mode by adding a DOCTYPE
p1732
aVI can't stress how much easier this will make your life but oddly many people don't seem to do it still;
p1733
aVMinimize box model issues by either using the correct DOCTYPE or using nested block elements rather than the other box model hacks; and
p1734
aVIf necessary include extra CSS files for relevant browsers
p1735
aVI tend to do this on the server rather than the client with generated pages (which, let's face it, is most of them)
p1736
aVMany projects I've worked on have had IEfix
p1737
aVcss files
p1738
aVAfter that, I divide browsers into tiers:
p1739

p1742
aVMy website must work on these

aVSafari;
p1746
aVOpera;
p1747
aVChrome
p1748
aVMy website should work on these
p1749
aVThis may offend some people but frankly the market share of these browsers is so low that they're simply not as important as Firefox 3 or IE7
p1750
aVTier 3:
p1751
aVIE6;
p1752
aVOthers
p1753
aVMinimal effort will be made to work on these unless it is, for example, a company requirement
p1754
aVIE6 is the nightmare one but it's market share as of December was 20% and rapidly falling
p1755
aVPlus there are valid security concerns (on financial websites for example) for dissuading or even disallowing the use of IE6 such that sites like Paypal have blocked IE6 and Google tells users to drop IE6

VHonestly I would rethink your approach and I'll tell you why
p1798
aVI've done a lot of work on distributed high-volume systems (financial transactions specifically) and your solution--if the volume is sufficiently high (and I'll assume it is or you wouldn't be contemplating a clustered solution; you can get an awful lot of power out of one off-the-shelf box these days)--then you will kill yourself with remote calls (ie calls for data from another node)
p1799
aVI will speak about Tangosol/Oracle Coherence here because it's what I've got the most experience with, although Terracotta will support some or most of these features and is free
p1800
aVIn Coherence terms what you have is a partitioned cache where if you have n nodes, each node possesses 1/n of the total data
p1801
aVTypically you have redundancy of at least one level and that redundancy is spread as evenly as possible so each of the other n-1 nodes possesses 1/n-1 of the backup nodes
p1802
aVThe idea in such a solution is to try and make sure as many of the cache hits as possible are local (to the same cluster node)
p1803
aVAlso with partitioned caches in particular, writes are relatively espensive (and get more expensive with the more backup nodes you have for each cache entry)--although write-behind caching can minimize this--and reads are fairly cheap (which is what you want out of your requirements)
p1804
aVSo your solution is going to ensure that every cache hit will be to a remote node
p1805
aVAlso consider that generating content is undoubtedly much more expensive than serving it, which I'll assume is why you came up with this idea because then you can have more content generators than servers
p1806
aVIt's the more tiered approach and one I'd characterize as horizontal slicing
p1807
aVYou will achieve much better scalability if you can vertically slice your application
p1808
aVBy that I mean that each node is responsible for storing, generating and serving a subset of all the content
p1809
aVThis effectively eliminates internode communication (excluding backups) and allows you to adjust the solution by simply giving each node a different sized subset of the content
p1810
aVIdeally, whatever scheme you choose for partitioning your data should be reproducible by your Web server so it knows exactly which node to hit for the relevant data
p1811
aVNow you might have other reasons for doing it the way you're proposing but I can only answer this in the context of available information

p1835
aVIt's all a bit messy
p1836
aVI'd take a step back and define your DAO:
p1837
aVand then create two implementations:
p1838
aVOne advantage of this approach is that if certain methods shouldn't be used by a particular role you have the option of throwing some security violation exception
p1839
aVNow how you plug that in to the rest of your application is something I don't have enough detail to comment on
p1840
aVYou might be using BlazeDS in which case I'd suggest using the Spring integration with BlazeDS, which will open up dependency injection as an option
p1841
aVAlternatively you could use a simple factory method (based on role) to get the correct DAO

VBear in mind that, as proven by the halting problem, you can't definitely say that a particular class is or isn't used

VJava Generics are massively different to C++ templates
p2134
aVBasically in C++ templates are basically a glorified preprocessor/macro set (Note: since some people seem unable to comprehend an analogy, I'm not saying template processing is a macro)
p2135
aVIn Java they are basically syntactic sugar to minimize boilerplate casting of Objects
p2136
aVHere is a pretty decent introduction to C++ templates vs Java generics
p2137
aVTo elaborate on this point: when you use a C++ template, you're basically creating another copy of the code, just as if you used a  macro
p2138
aVThis allows you to do things like have  parameters in template definitions that determine sizes of arrays and such
p2139
aVJava doesn't work like that
p2140
aVIn Java all objects extent from java
p2141
aVlang
p2142
aVObject so, pre-Generics, you'd write code like this:
p2143
aVbecause all the Java collection types used Object as their base type so you could put anything in them
p2144
aVJava 5 rolls around and adds generics so you can do things like:
p2145
aVAnd that's all Java Generics are: wrappers for casting objects
p2146
aVThat's because Java Generics aren't reified
p2147
aVThey use type erasure
p2148
aVThis decision was made because Java Generics came along so late in the piece that they didn't want to break backward compatibility (a  is usable whenever a  is called for)
p2149
aVCompare this to
p2150
aVNet/C# where type erasure isn't used, which leads to all sorts of differences (eg you can use primitive types and  and  bear no relation to each other)
p2151
aVAnd a class using generics compiled with a Java 5+ compiler is usable no JDK 1
p2152
aV4 (assuming it doesn't use any ohter features or classes that require Java 5+)
p2153
aVThat's why Java Generics are called syntactic sugar
p2154
aVBut this decision on how to do generics has profound effects so much so that the (superb) Java Generics FAQ has sprung up to answer the many, many questions people have about Java Generics
p2155
aVC++ templates have a number of features that Java Generics don't:
p2156
aVUse of primitive type arguments
p2157
aVFor example:
p2158
aVUse of default type arguments, which is one feature I miss in Java but there are backwards compatibility reasons for this;
p2159
aVC++ allows the use of primitive type arguments, Java doesn't; and
p2160
aVJava allows bounding of arguments
p2161
aVFor example:
p2162
aVIt really does need to be stressed that template invocations with different arguments really are different types
p2163
aVThey don't even share static members
p2164
aVIn Java this is not the case
p2165
aVAside from the differences with generics, for completeness, here is a basic comparison of C++ and Java (and another one)
p2166
aVAnd I can also suggest Thinking in Java
p2167
aVAs a C++ programmer a lot of the concepts like objects will be second nature already but there are subtle differences so it can be worthwhile to have an introductory text even if you skim parts
p2168
aVA lot of what you'll learn when laerning Java is all the libraries (both standard--what comes in the JDK--and nonstandard, which includes commonly used things like Spring)
p2169
aVJava syntax is more verbose than C++ syntax and doesn't have a lot of C++ features (eg operator overloading, mutliple inheritance, the destructor mechanism, etc) but that doesn't strictly make it a subset of C++ either

p2213
aVThe join version I proposed is twenty times faster than the aggregate version
p2214
aVSorry but I do this for a living and work in the real world and in the real world we test SQL and the results speak for themselves
p2215
aVThe reason for this should be pretty clear
p2216
aVThe aggregate query will scale in cost with the size of the table
p2217
aVEvery row is processed, aggregated and filtered (or not) through the  clause
p2218
aVThe join version will (using an index) select a subset of the users based on a given role, then check that subset against the second role and finally that subset against the third role
p2219
aVEach selection (in relational algebra terms) works on an increasingly small subset
p2220
aVFrom this you can conclude:
p2221
aVThe performance of the join version gets even better with a lower incidence of matches
p2222
aVIf there were only 500 users (out of the 500k sample above) that had the three stated roles, the join version will get significantly faster
p2223
aVThe aggregate version will not (and any performance improvement is a result of transporting 500 users instead of 25k, which the join version obviously gets too)
p2224
aVI was also curious to see how a real database (ie Oracle) would deal with this
p2225
aVSo I basically repeated the same exercise on Oracle XE (running on the same Windows XP desktop machine as the MySQL from the previous example) and the results are almost identical
p2226
aVJoins seem to be frowned upon but as I've demonstrated, aggregate queries can be an order of magnitude slower
p2227
aVUpdate: After some extensive testing, the picture is more complicated and the answer will depend on your data, your database and other factors

p2242

aVAs such--and I may get downvoted for saying this--I don't think jQuery is the answer and I say this as someone who loves jQuery
p2244
aVjQuery (imho) is great to enhance Webpages and abstract cross-browser low-level functionality but the most important factor for complex UI developer is this:
p2245
aVIt's all about the widgets
p2246
aVAnd yes I'm aware of jQuery UI but it's a lot sparser than the others when it comes to widgets
p2247
aVI suggest you take a look at the samples and widget galleries of some frameworks:
p2248
aVYUI Examples Gallery;
p2249
aVExtJS demo; and
p2250
aVSmartClient feature explorer
p2251
aVThe others (jQuery, Dojo, Mootools, Prototype) are more "compact" frameworks arguably less suited to your purpose
p2252
aVAlso consider the license of each framework when making your decision
p2253
aVMy thoughts on the above three are:
p2254
aVExtJS has somewhat angered the community in that it started out as LGPL but had a controversial license change (that thread is at 76 pages
p2255
aVto GPL/commercial at version 2
p2256
aV1
p2257
aVThe problem with that the community no longer has an active participation in the framework's development
p2258
aVNot the mainline version anyway
p2259
aVThis means it's being developed and supported by a small team (possibly one person) rather than the community
p2260
aVIMHO it's not worth paying a commercial license for that and GPL is probably prohibitive in your situation;
p2261
aVYUI is supported by Yahoo and available under a far more permissive and far less invasive BSD license
p2262
aVIt's mature, well-used and well worth serious consideration; and
p2263
aVSmartClient impresses me a lot
p2264
aVIt has perhaps the most permissive license of all (LGPL), is roughly seven years old, has an incredibly impressive array of widgets available
p2265
aVCheck out their feature explorer
p2266
aVYour decision should be based on how you get as much of your application "for free" as possible
p2267
aVYou don't want to spending valuable developer time doing things like:
p2268
aVCoding UI widgets like trees and accordions;
p2269
aVTesting and fixing cross-browser Javascript and CSS issues;
p2270

aVIt's far easier to change than the nested set model, although the nested set model can be retrieved in the correct order in a single query
p2281
aVAdjacency lists can't be

p2324

p2325

p2326
aVLeft outer join:
p2327
aVWrong and the reason why is somewhat subtle
p2328
aVcounts  rows whereas  doesn't
p2329
aVSo the above is wrong but this is correct:
p2330
aVCorrelated subquery:
p2331
aVAlso correct
p2332
aVOk, so which to use
p2333
aVPlans only tell you so much
p2334
aVThe issue of subqueries vs left-joins is an old one and there's no clear answer without benchmarking it
p2335
aVSo we need some data:
p2336
aVI ran out of memory (32M) during this run so only ended up with 876,109 records but hey it will do
p2337
aVLater, when I test Oracle and SQL Server I take the exact same set of data and import it into Oracle XE and SQL Server Express 2005
p2338
aVNow another poster raised the issue of my using a count wrapper around the queries
p2339
aVHe correctly pointed out that the optimizer may not execute the subqueries in that case
p2340
aVMySQL doesn't seem to be that smart
p2341
aVOracle is
p2342
aVSQL Server seems to be as well
p2343
aVSo I'll quote two figures for each database-query combination: the first is wrapped in , the second is raw
p2344
aVSetup:
p2345
aVMySQL 5
p2346
aV0 using PremiumSoft Navicat ( in query);
p2347
aVSQL Server Express 2005 using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio Express;
p2348
aVOracle XE using PL/SQL Developer 7 (limited to 10,000 rows)
p2349

aVMySQL: 5
p2351
aV0: 51
p2352

p2355
aVOracle XE: 1
p2356
aV297s / 2
p2357
aV656s
p2358
aV(1) Virtually instantaneous (confirming the different execution path)
p2359
aV(2) Impressive considering it is returning all the rows, not 10,000
p2360
aVJust goes to show the value of a real database
p2361
aVAlso, removing the SomeText field had a significant impact on MySQL's performance
p2362
aVAlso there wasn't much difference between the limit of 10000 and not having it with MySQL (improving performance by a factor of 4-5)
p2363
aVOracle had it just because PL/SQL Developer barfed when it hit 100M memory usage
p2364
aVCorrelated Subquery:
p2365
aVMySQL: 8
p2366
aV844s / 11
p2367
aV10s
p2368
aVSQL Server: 0s / 6s
p2369
aVOracle: 0
p2370
aV046s / 1
p2371
aV563s
p2372
aVSo MySQL is better by a factor of 4-5, Oracle is about twice as fast and SQL Server is arguably only a little faster
p2373
aVThe point remains: the correlated subquery version is faster in all cases
p2374
aVThe other advantage of correlated subqueries is that they are syntactically cleaner and easier to extend
p2375
aVBy this I mean that if you want to do a count in a bunch of other tables, each can be included as another select item cleanly and easily
p2376
aVFor example: imagine a record of customers to invoices where those invoices were either unpaid, overdue or paid

aVStandards exist for a reason

p2431
aVIf you see a gzip octet stream, there's no mistaking it for XML

aVThe real problem with the shorthand scheme you've got is that it still has  at the top so some poor unsuspecting parser may make the mistake of thinking its valid and bomb out with a different, misleading error;
p2433
aVInformation theory: compression works by removing redundancy of information
p2434
aVIf you do that by hand, it makes gzip compression no more effective because the same amount of information is represetned;
p2435
aVThere is a significant overhead on converting documents to and from this scheme
p2436
aVIt can't be done with a standard XML parser so you'd have to effectively write your own XML parser and outputter that understands this scheme (actually conversion to this format can be done with a parser; getting it back is more difficult), which is a lot of work (and a lot of bugs)

p2626

p2627
aVThe Web (or HTTP specifically) is (basically) a request-response mechanism in that a client makes a request and receives a response (typically a Web page of some kind)
p2628
aVHTTP doesn't natively support the ability for servers to push content to clients
p2629
aVThere are a number of ways this can be faked, including:
p2630
aVPolling: forcing the client to make repeated requests, typically inconspicuously (as far as the client is concerned);
p2631
aVLong-lived connections: this is where the client makes a normal HTTP request but instead of returning immediately the server hangs on to the request until there's something to send back
p2632
aVWhen the request times out or a response is sent th eclient sends another request
p2633
aVIn this way you can fake server push;
p2634
aVPlug-ins: Java applets, Flash, Silverlight and others can be used to achieve this
p2635
aVAnything where the server effectively sends data to the client (rather than the client asking for it)--regardless of the mechanism and whether or not the client is polling for that data--can be characterised as streaming data
p2636
aVWith non-HTTP transports (eg vanilla TCP) server push is typically easier (but can still run afoul of firewalls and th elike)

VIt's all about process and managing expectations and very little to do with the technical
p2648
aVThe mistake (imho) most clients make--particularly with smaller consultancies--is that they go for a fixed price contract (possibly with support being billed T&M;: time and materials)
p2649
aVThey do this as a risk management exercise so it's understandable
p2650
aVThe problem is that they are paying for that lower risk in three ways:
p2651
aVYou pay a premium for lower risk
p2652
aVThis is a fundamental principle that is as true in software development as it is in financial markets;
p2653
aVSo much risk can be put on the developer(s) that the cost goes up astronomically, which benefits precisely noone (well, it benefits the developer until things go catastrophically wrong, which they nearly always do eventually); and
p2654
aVYou spend so much time developing a specification and formalizing the deliverables and acceptance criteria that you forget in doing so you've just spent $300k writing a 300 page Word document instead of, you know, coding something
p2655
aVAll of this serves to make the end result more expensive for the client, demotivating for the developer (who wants to write 300 page Word docs
p2656
aVSeriously
p2657
aVand it delays the client actually getting anything (thus increasing the risk of scope creep, which is directly proportional to the length of the project)
p2658
aVBoth parties would often be better served by taking the T&M; approach combined with some form of rapid prototyping methodology with regular deliverables or demonstrations to the client no more than 4-6 weeks apart
p2659
aVThis goes towards managing expectations
p2660
aVIf the client can see something is happening it puts them at ease and lets you get on with the job (rather thans pending time in meetings going over GANTT charts)
p2661
aVSo what you should do is try and voncince your client to go for a graduated approach (baby steps) where they can see what they're getting, how it's evolving and participate in the process
p2662
aVIt gets results faster and is ultimately cheaper (with both parties sharing the risk burden)
p2663
aVOne thing many developers also seem to forget is that they are like royal subjects in 15th century France
p2664
aVThey may have privilege, even riches, and many perqs but they serve at the pleasure of the king (or queen), who can behead them on a whim
p2665
aVBy this I mean that the client ultimately wields the power and you, as a developer, exist to make their life easier and not the other way around
p2666
aVIf the client wants a pink and green website developed in Cobol on Rails running on a virtual Vax/VMS server on the boss's iphone well that's what they get
p2667
aVNow you can use your expertise and experience to try and convince them that's not a good idea but ultimately if that's what they want you have two choices: give it to them or walk
p2668
aVToo many developers fall into the trap of giving people what they think they should have, not what they ask for
p2669
aVBIG MISTAKE
p2670
aVPart of the process is to keep communication channels open with the client such that you don't go off on a tangent thinking they want something (or deciding they should have something) when they're expecting something completely different

VSpeaking as someone who spent quite a bit of time working with JPA (Java Persistence API, basically the standardized ORM API for Java/J2EE/EJB), which includes Hibernate, EclipseLink, Toplink, OpenJPA and others, I'll share some of my observations
p2823
aVORMs are not fast
p2824
aVThey can be adequate and most of the time adequate is OK but in a high-volume low-latency environment they're a no-no;
p2825
aVIn general purpose programming languages like Java and C# you need an awful lot of magic to make them work (eg load-time weaving in Java, instrumentation, etc);
p2826
aVWhen using an ORM, rather than getting further from SQL (which seems to be the intent), you'll be amazed how much time you spend tweaking XML and/or annotations/attributes to get your ORM to generate performant SQL;
p2827
aVFor complex queries, there really is no substitute
p2828
aVLike in JPA there are some queries that simply aren't possible that are in raw SQL and when you have to use raw SQL in JPA it's not pretty (C#/
p2829
aVNet at least has dynamic types--var--which is a lot nicer than an Object array);
p2830
aVThere are an awful lot of "gotchas" when using ORMs
p2831
aVThis includes unintended or unexpected behavior, the fact that you have to build in the capability to do SQL updates to your database (by using refresh() in JPA or similar methods because JPA by default caches everything so it won't catch a direct database update--running direct SQL updates is a common production support activity);
p2832
aVThe object-relational mismatch is always going to cause problems
p2833
aVWith any such problem there is a tradeoff between complexity and completeness of the abstraction
p2834
aVAt times I felt JPA went too far and hit a real law of diminishing returns where the complexity hit wasn't justified by the abstraction
p2835
aVThere's another problem which takes a bit more explanation
p2836
aVThe traditional model for a Web application is to have a persistence layer and a presentation layer (possibly with a services or other layers in between but these are the important two for this discussion)
p2837
aVORMs force a rigid view from your persistence layer up to the presentation layer (ie your entities)
p2838
aVOne of the criticisms of more raw SQL methods is that you end up with all these VOs (value objects) or DTOs (data transfer objects) that are used by simply one query
p2839
aVThis is touted as an advantage of ORMs because you get rid of that
p2840
aVThing is those problems don't go away with ORMs, they simply move up to the presentation layer
p2841
aVInstead of creating VOs/DTOs for queries, you create custom presentation objects, typically one for every view
p2842
aVHow is this better
p2843
aVIMHO it isn't
p2844
aVI've written about this in ORM or SQL: Are we there yet
p2845
aVMy persistence technology of choice (in Java) these days is ibatis
p2846
aVIt's a pretty thin wrapper around SQL that does 90%+ of what JPA can do (it can even do lazy-loading of relationships although its not well-documented) but with far less overhead (in terms of complexity and actual code)
p2847
aVThis came up last year in a GWT application I was writing
p2848
aVLots of translation from EclipseLink to presentation objects in the service implementation
p2849
aVIf we were using ibatis it would've been far simpler to create the appropriate objects with ibatis and then pass them all the way up and down the stack
p2850
aVSome purists might argue this is Bad\u2122
p2851
aVMaybe so (in theory) but I tell you what: it would've led to simpler code, a simpler stack and more productivity

p2868
aVEvery now and again reorder the items as a batch job
p2869
aVThe large increments don't eliminate the problem of doing a large reorder but the need to do a big reorder highly unlikely and the batch job is there to reorder them say once every day/week/month as required

VIt's hard to answer this question without more information but with these kinds of branding/multi-homing issues, the one key question to ask is this:
p2877
aVAre these sites (for the different customers) more alike than different
p2878
aVNow that's a subjective question
p2879
aVHow much are two sites alike
p2880
aVCan you quantify that
p2881
aVNot really
p2882
aVBut if the answer is "they're almost totally the same" or even "they are the same" (branding issues notwithstanding) then do yourself a favour and host only one version of the code and have both sites point to it
p2883
aVYou can easily determine what server was called and change your logic accordingly
p2884
aVBranding is the other issue but if you've done your application right this should be largely an issue of changing your CSS includes, possibly your Javascript includes (eg jQuery styling) and (hopefully worst case scenario) changing your headers and footers (you do have global headers and footers right
p2885

p2935
aVHonestly
p2936
aVIn my humble opinion
p2937
aVnever
p2938
aVI think it's been about 6 years since I last created a checked exception
p2939
aVYou can't force someone to deal with an error
p2940
aVArguably it makes code worse not better
p2941
aVI can't tell you the number of times I've come across code like this:
p2942
aVWhereas I have countless times written code like this:
p2943
aVWhy
p2944
aVBecause a condition (not necessarily IOException; that's just an example) wasn't recoverable but was forced down my throat anyway and I am often forced to make the choice between doing the above and polluting my API just to propagate a checked exception all the way to the top where it's (rightlfully) fatal and will be logged
p2945
aVThere's a reason Spring's DAO helper classes translate the checked SQLException into the unchecked DataAccessException
p2946
aVIf you have things like lack of write permissions to a disk, lack of disk space or other fatal conditions you want to be making as much noise as possible and the way to do this is with
p2947
aVunchecked exceptions (or even Errors)
p2948
aVAdditionally, checked exceptions break encapsulation
p2949
aVThis idea that checked exceptions should be used for "recoverable" errors is really pie-in-the-sky wishful thinking

VDisclaimer: I am by no means a Ruby or Rails expert
p3034
aVAs someone who's been in the industry for nigh on 15 years I see several warning signs that make me nervous about Ruby on Rails specifically
p3035
aVI'm going to ignore the language here because a language is a language
p3036
aVRuby is a modern language with closures, exceptions, OO, etc
p3037
aVSome criticize it with regards to performance
p3038
aVThese issues are largely irrelevant in that they don't impact real world performance (if it takes 300ms to download and display a Web page, who cares that the serverside codes takes 10, 20 or even 30ms to run
p3039
aVand transitory in that they are fixed in later versions (as seems to be the case with Ruby 1
p3040
aV9)
p3041
aVRuby on Rails is a closed, heavyweight stack
p3042
aVI mean this as an observation not an accusation
p3043
aVIt is tightly integrated (including with Prototype) much like JBoss Seam in the Java world (being integrated tightly with JBoss/Hibernate and yes I know recent releases and articles have tackled the issue of using it with, say, Glassfish and another JPA provider)
p3044
aVThis can be both a good thing and a bad thing
p3045
aVJ2EE, for example, being a fairly open stack was the cause for much innovation in the software industry in the last decade as almost every piece of it (notably EJB) was replaced by different projects that could be slotted together
p3046
aVAnd of course it was, if not the birthplace for Spring, it was certainly the incubator
p3047
aVOn the other hand you have more closed stacks like
p3048
aVNet where their closed nature allows for rapid innovation, a model Microsoft has (generally) excelled at
p3049
aVIn a few short years DirextX went from being a joke to completely trouncing OpenGL as a games development platform because any closed system can evolve that much faster than an open standards system
p3050
aVThat's just how it works
p3051
aVThe other relevant point I'll mention is that in recent years there has been a move towards ORMs ("object-relational mapping") in Java,
p3052
aVNet and elsewhere and this is part of the impetus behind Rails
p3053
aVI've commented on this previously, for example "Using an ORM or plain SQL
p3054
aVand I won't reiterate those points in their entirety
p3055
aVAs most of you would know there is a mismatch between the object and relational worlds that ORMs have sought to bridge
p3056
aVIn the last year or two I've dealt with this mainly through Java (JPA specifically)
p3057
aVNow when you bridge between two things that don't match you end up with "leaky abstractions" (as Joel put it):
p3058
aVAll non-trivial abstractions, to some
p3059
aVdegree, are leaky
p3060
aVNow what I'll add is this: there is an inverse relationship between the complexity of the abstraction and how leaky the abstraction is
p3061
aVCase in point: ibatis
p3062
aVIbatis is an extremely lightweight yet powerful persistence framework for Java and one I'm a huge fan of
p3063
aVIt wraps SQL in external files and on top of that puts many modern ORM behaviour, such as:
p3064
aVLazy-loading of relationships;
p3065
aVResult mapping;
p3066
aVGrouping of results to multiple levels (something JPA can't do); and
p3067
aVDiscriminated types (ie the type is determined the data)
p3068
aVI would estimate that ibatis has 90-95% of the functionality of Hibernate with the only complexity overhead being runtime bytecode enhancement for the lazy loading via cglib (JPA does it the same way) with the only downside that you have to write your own queries (and I don't consider that a serious downside but opnions will vary)
p3069
aVCompare that to a JPA provider that relies on instrumentation, load-time weaving and non-standard class loaders to implemennt that extra 5-10% fu

VHonestly I don't see the point in doing superscript/subscript in CSS only
p3118
aVThere's no handy CSS attribute for it, just a bunch of homegrown implementations including:
p3119

p3120
aVThing is, it starts to get complicated:
p3121
aVCSS superscript spacing on line height;

p3123
aVThe second point is worth emphasizing
p3124
aVTypically superscript/subscript is not actually a styling issue but is indicative of meaning
p3125
aVSide note: It's worth mentioning this list of entities for common mathematical superscript and subscript expressions even though this question doesn't relate to that

aVIMHO no
p3161
aVAnd I'll tell you why
p3162
aVBut first I'll add the disclaimer that this is a complicated topic so any answer has to be viewed as barely scratching the surface
p3163
aVFirst instead of repeating myself I'll point you to a summary of Java grid/cluster technologies that I wrote awhile ago
p3164
aVIts a mostly complete list
p3165
aVThe star topology is "natural" for a "naive" (I don't mean that in a bad way) implementation because point-to-point is simple and centralizing key controller logic is also simple
p3166
aVIt is however not fault-tolerant
p3167
aVIt introduces scalability problems and a single bottleneck
p3168
aVIt introduces communication inefficiences (namely the points communicate via a two-step process through the center)
p3169
aVWhat you really want for this is probably a cluster (rather than a data/compute grid) solution and I'd suggest you look at Terracotta
p3170
aVIdeally you'd look at Oracle Coherence but it's no doubt expensive (compared to free)
p3171
aVIt is a fantastic product though
p3172
aVThese two products can be used a number of ways but the core of both is to treat a cache like a distributed map
p3173
aVYou put things in, you take things out and you fire off code that alters the cache
p3174
aVCoherence (with which I'm more familiar) in this regards scales fantastically well
p3175
aVThese are more "server" based products though for a true cluster
p3176
aVIf you're looking at a more distributed model then perhaps you should be looking at more of an SOA based approach

VA lot of this depends on how you're storing the data
p3226
aVThere are two factors to consider:
p3227
aVHow oftne does the data change
p3228
aVHow much does the data change
p3229
aVThe distinction is important
p3230
aVIf it changes often but not much then annotated snapshots are going to be extremely inefficient
p3231
aVIf it changes infrequently but a lot then they're a better solution
p3232
aVIt also depends on if you need to see what the data looked like at a specific point in time
p3233
aVIf you're using Oracle, for example, you can use flashback queries to see a consistent view of the data at some arbitrary point
p3234
aVPersonally I think you're better off storing it incrementally and, at a minimum, using some form of auditing to track changes so you can recover an historic snapshot if it's ever required

VThere are a few ways of doing this and it depends on what your environment is
p3272
aVIf you're using Spring there's a fair chance you're deploying a Web application or you're otherwise in a J2EE environment
p3273
aVIf this is the case (and arguably even if it isn't) you probably want to configure a DataSource
p3274
aVThis is a fairly minimal solution:
p3275
aVThe above is using the Apache (Jakarta Commons) database connection pooling but your appserver probably has an alternative you may want to use instead
p3276
aVAlso, different database vendors have their own data source implementations too (eg OracleDataSource and OracleXADataSource for Oracle)
p3277
aVNote the use of properties like jdbc
p3278
aVusername
p3279
aVThis is a typical configuration because database configurations typically vary between environment
p3280
aVYou can activate a property configurator with something like:
p3281
aVNow you probably want transactions too I would imagine
p3282
aVThe easiest way is to use a platform transaction manager but, like with most things Spring, there are multiple ways of doing it
p3283

VI have several problems with aspects of your post (and agree in other parts)
p3359
aVFirstly, although classic ASP works fine I think the time has come for it to be considered legacy technology, replaced by ASP
p3360
aVNET (and yes I realize that ASP and ASP
p3361
aVNET aren't all that similar)
p3362
aVIf you were simply maintaining classic ASP code then I could understand keeping it
p3363
aVSignificant new development in classic ASP would have to be thought about long and hard
p3364
aVThe problem is I put ColdFusion into the same bucket as classic ASP
p3365
aVTo give you an example, consider this trend of ASP
p3366
aVNET vs ColdFusion
p3367
aVYou'll see significnatly less for CF and what's even worse, it's declining
p3368
aVI find Google Trends to be a pretty reasonable barometer of mindshare when it comes to these things as well as the overall market trend
p3369
aVStill not convinced
p3370
aVTry:
p3371
aVColdFusion is Dead;
p3372
aVMicrosoft's Migrating from ColdFusion to ASP
p3373
aVNET, which actually has a very detailed feature comparison;
p3374
aVAn Evaluation of the Current US Technology Job Market (dated 2004);
p3375
aVAsp, Jsp, Php, Ruby, Python, Coldfusion Trends: this showed a slight increase but CF has really been flat for years and the market has to be considered to be in maintenance mode; and
p3376
aVThe top 10 dead (or dying) computer skills (although Computerworld also predicted the death of Apple and the Mac so take that one with a grain of salt)
p3377
aVThe second problem I have is that you're proposing to tie them into a proprietary solution based on that same "legacy" technology
p3378
aVWhat happens when you move on from your bespoke CMS
p3379
aVWhat happens if they want to discharge you as their consultants (and this can happen for many reasons that have nothing to do with your competency)
p3380
aVThe third problem I have is that you want to talk them out of
p3381
aVNet and this seems purely motivated by selfish reasons, namely that none of you really know it and, quite simply, you don't like it
p3382
aVFact is though that Microsoft is pushing that much more than anything else, it has a huge developer and user base and seems to have a lot of momentum
p3383
aVWhen you deal with a client you have a duty of care to put that client's needs ahead of your own, ethically if not legally
p3384
aVIn particularly egregious cases that can be professional misconduct
p3385
aVYou should be giving the client at least three options:
p3386
aVUpgrading the current system;
p3387
aVDoing it in ColdFusion; and
p3388
aVDoing it in ASP
p3389
aVNET
p3390
aVIt's reasonable to advocate a particular choice that you're strong in or that you simply prefer but in doing so you can cross a line by misrepresenting the other choices
p3391
aVAfter 12+ years in the software development industry, what you're saying just raises all kinds of red flags to me
p3392
aVThat all being said, it's really hard to comment on what the best choice is because we really don't know what the system is, what their constraints are (time, money, staged deployment, business, etc) and all those other things that do (and must) go into the decision-making pot (arguably it's more of a cauldron)
p3393
aVThere might be soem compelling reasons to choose one over the others but, on the face of it, I'd either being doing further development in classic ASP or looking towards ASP
p3394
aVNET since they're clearly already a Microsoft shop
p3395
aVI wouldn't even be considering ColdFusion
p3396
aVI should also point out that a complete rewrite is nearly always a mistake, especially if you can't do it in stages or some other piecemeal approach
p3397
aVWhile you're doing your rewrite the business is either stalled (waiting for the new code) or you're doubling your efforts (doing new development and maintaining the old)

p3559
aVEDIT: Ok, the point was asked about canonical form
p3560
aVThis article defines it as:
p3561
aVSuppose we have some set S of objects,
p3562
aVwith an equivalence relation
p3563
aVA
p3564
aVcanonical form is given by designating
p3565
aVsome objects of S to be "in canonical
p3566
aVform", such that every object under
p3567
aVconsideration is equivalent to exactly
p3568
aVone object in canonical form
p3569
aVTo give you a practical example: take the set of rational numbers (or "fractions" are they're commonly called)
p3570
aVA rational number consists of a numerator and a denomoinator (divisor), both of which are integers
p3571
aVThese rational numbers are equivalent:
p3572
aV3/2, 6/4, 24/16
p3573
aVRational nubmers are typically written such that the gcd (greatest common divisor) is 1
p3574
aVSo all of them will be simplified to 3/2
p3575
aV3/2 can be viewed as the canonical form of this set of rational numbers
p3576
aVSo what does it mean in programming when the term "canonical form" is used
p3577
aVIt can mean a couple of things
p3578
aVTake for example this imaginary class:
p3579
aVThe hash code of the class MyInt is a canonical form of that class because for the set of all instances of MyInt, you can take any two elements m1 and m2 and they will obey the following relation:
p3580
aVThat relation is the essence of canonical form
p3581
aVA more common way this crops up is when you use factory methods on classes such as:
p3582
aVInstances cannot be directly instantiated because the constructor is private
p3583
aVThis is just a factory method
p3584
aVWhat a factory method allows you to do is things like:
p3585
aVAlways return the same instance (abstracted singleton);
p3586
aVJust create a new intsance with every call;
p3587
aVReturn objects in canonical form (more on this in a second); or
p3588
aVwhatever you like
p3589
aVBasically the factory method abstracts object creation and personally I think it would be an interesting language feature to force all constructors to be private to enforce the use of this pattern but I digress
p3590
aVWhat you can do with this factory method is cache your instances that you create such that for any two instances s1 and s2 they obey the following test:
p3591
aVSo when I say String isn't strictly canonical it means that:
p3592
aVBut as others have poitned out you can change this by using:
p3593
aVand possibly:
p3594
aVSo you can't rely on reference equality completely so you shouldn't rely on it at all
p3595
aVAs a caveat to the above pattern, I should point out that controlling object creation with private constructors and factory methods doesn't guarantee reference equality means object equality because of serialization
p3596
aVSerialization bypasses the normal object creation mechanism
p3597
aVJosh Bloch covers this topic in Effective Java (originally in the first edition when he talked about the typesafe enum pattern which later became a language feature in Java 5) and you can get around it by overloading the (private) readResolve() method
p3598
aVBut it's tricky
p3599
aVClass loaders will affect the issue too

p3627
aVIt is (rightly) maligned as a substitute for effective security
p3628
aVA typical principle in cryptography is that a message is unknown but the contents are not
p3629
aVAlgorithms for encyrption are typically widely published, analyzed by mathematicians and, after a time, some confidence is built up in their effectivness but there is never a guarantee that they're effective
p3630
aVSome people hide their cryptographic algorithms but this is considered a dangerous practice because then such algorithms haven't gone through the same scrutiny
p3631
aVOnly organisations like the NSA, which has a significant budget and staff of mathematicians, can get away with this kind of approach
p3632
aVOne of the more interesting developments in recent years has been the risk of steganography, which is the practice is hiding message in images, sound files or some other medium
p3633
aVThe biggest problem in steganalysis is identifying whether or not a message is there or not, making this security through obscurity
p3634
aVLast year I came across a story that Researchers Calculate Capacity of a Steganographic Channel but the really interesting thing about this is:
p3635
aVStudying a stego-channel in this way

aVleads to some counter-intuitive

p3775
aVI wrote an overview of Java grid/cluster libraries awhile back that is useful background

aVIf commercial software is an option I'd suggest looking at GigaSpaces (or some freeware JavaSpaces implementation if not)

aVFIFO ordering of messages, if that's important to you (although that comes with a performance cost);

p3780
aVIt comes with a JMS implementation built on top if you want to use that queueing API; and
p3781
aVMessages are defined by class so you can just read/write the appropriate operations
p3782
aVGigaSpaces (and any serious grid/clustering technology really) scales well
p3783
aVMuch better than a pure queueing solution, which either doesn't scale with publish-subscribe (since all listeners receive a message; not typically what you want) or request-response (where you have to make sure the queue isn't blocked by a bad message)
p3784

aVIt can run across multiple machines

p3863
aVYou can run memcache on one or more servers
p3864
aVYou can configure your clients to speak to a specific set of instances
p3865
aVYou can run two (or more) different memcache processes on the same host (listening to different IP addresses and/or ports) and they're completely independent

aVIf your two applications talk to the same instance(s) then there's no reason they can't communicate

VI'd take a serious look at ibatis (for both Java and
p3878
aVNet)
p3879
aVI say that for a few reasons:
p3880
aVFirst, ORMs like NHibernate that really try and abstract away the database I think can be counterproductive, particularly when dealing with "legacy" databases
p3881
aVLegacy here doesn't mean what you think it means
p3882
aVTools like Hibernate and JPA (Java) define pretty much anything that doesn't do things the "proper" way as legacy, and that can include using composite keys (seriously, I read a JPA book taht called composite keys "legacy")
p3883
aVIbatis on the other hand gives you most of the power of an ORM (and some things that Hibernate, for example, can't do like the groupBy functionality) but still leaves you able to just write plain SQL
p3884
aVI imagine with a database that large you're going to have some questionable modelling decisions that will be difficult if not impossible to map into many ORMs
p3885
aVBy writing direct SQL you can cater for these situations in ibatis by definition
p3886
aVORMs that aren't vendor specific are also lowest common denominator when it comes to query language
p3887
aVIf all databases can't do it then you can't do it anywhere
p3888
aVOracle has one of the most sophisticated SQL dialects
p3889
aVYou should use it
p3890
aVThings like CONNECT PRIOR don't exist in many other SQL dialects (and thus aren't modelled in a performant manner in abstracted ORMs)

aVMany developers will be running on screens with resolutions like 1680x1050, 1920x1200 and 1280x1024
p3902
aVSome users will be using 1024x768, which I personally consider the lowest resolution you need to cater for (thank God it's not 800x600 anymore)

aVA small minority of users that have high resolutions and actually want to stretch that content across the entire screen
p3910
aVI have a widescreen monitor and I won't maximize my browser for instance
p3911
aVMany people are like me in this respect
p3912
aVConsider another problem: CSS
p3913
aVCSS s good for many things but is a royal pain in many others
p3914
aVFor one thing
p3915
aVNow browser box model differences aside, there are still many quirks with how different browsers handle CSS and even if there weren't there are many trivial things CSS can't do and the only workaround is to do things by pixel
p3916
aVAs a concrete example, I'm doing some tables at the moment that are bursting at the seams
p3917
aVI'm reloading the contents with an Ajax call and replacing the contents
p3918
aVNow I at first tried to fix the widths of the columns with percentages
p3919
aVDoing it this way would be a prerequisite for not fixing the width
p3920
aVFirefox treated those as a suggestion and would resize them anyway even when it arguably didn't have to
p3921
aVI didn't get satisfactory results until I fixed the widths in pixels
p3922
aVAt the end of the day no website really cares if it stretches across 1600 pixels or not

VThere are a few issues here
p3930
aVFirstly, the async load method you specified:
p3931
aVhas a couple of issues
p3932
aVScript tags pause the page load while they are retrieved (if necessary)
p3933
aVNow if they're slow to load this is bad but jQuery is small
p3934
aVThe real problem with the above method is that because the jquery
p3935
aVjs load happens independently for many pages, they will finish loading and render before jquery has loaded so any jquery styling you do will be a visible change for the user
p3936
aVThe other way is:
p3937
aVTry some simple examples like, have a simple table and change the background of the cells to yellow with the setOnLoadCallback() method vs $(document)
p3938
aVready() with a static jquery
p3939
aVmin
p3940
aVjs load
p3941
aVThe second method will have no noticeable flicker
p3942
aVThe first will
p3943
aVPersonally I think that's not a good user experience
p3944
aVAs an example run this:
p3945
aVYou (should) see the table appear and then the rows go yellow
p3946
aVThe second problem with the google
p3947
aVload() method is that it only hosts a limited range of files
p3948
aVThis is a problem for jquery since it is extremely plug-in dependent
p3949
aVIf you try and include a jquery plugin with a  tag and  the plug-in will probably fail with messages of "jQuery is not defined" because it hasn't loaded yet
p3950
aVI don't really see a way around this
p3951
aVThe third problem (with either method) is that they are one external load
p3952
aVAssuming you have some plugins and your own Javascript code you're up to a minimum of two external requests to load your Javascript
p3953
aVYou're probably better off getting jquery, all relevant plug-ins and your own code and putting it into one minified file
p3954
aVFrom Should You Use Google's Ajax Libraries API for Hosting
p3955
aV:
p3956
aVAs to load times, you're actually
p3957
aVloading two scripts - the jsapi script
p3958
aVand the mootools script (the
p3959
aVcompressed version from above)
p3960
aVSo
p3961
aVthat is two connections, rather than
p3962
aVone
p3963
aVIn my experience, I found that
p3964
aVthe load time was actually 2-3 times
p3965
aVslower than loading from my own
p3966
aVpersonal shared server, even though it
p3967
aVwas coming from Google, and my version
p3968
aVof the compressed file was a couple of
p3969
aVK larger than Google's
p3970
aVThis, even
p3971
aVafter the file had loaded and
p3972
aV(presumably) cached
p3973
aVSo for me, since
p3974
aVthe bandwidth doesn't matter much,
p3975
aVisn't going to matter
p3976
aVLastly you have the potential problem of a paranoid browser flagging the request as some sort of XSS attempt
p3977
aVIt's not typically a problem with default settings but on corporate networks where the user may not have control over which browser they use let alone the security settings you may have a problem
p3978
aVSo in the end I can't really see me using the Google AJAX API for jQuery at least (the more "complete" APIs are a different story in some ways) much except to post examples here

VCaching is just the practice of storing data in and retrieving data from a high-performance store (usually memory) either explicitly or implicitly
p3985
aVLet me explain
p3986
aVMemory is faster to access than a file, a remote URL (usually), a database or any other external store of information you like
p3987
aVSo if the act of using one of those external resources is significant then you may benefit from caching to increase performance
p3988
aVKnuth once said that premature optimization is the root of all evil
p3989
aVWell, premature caching is the root of all headaches as far as I'm concerned
p3990
aVDon't solve a problem until you have a problem
p3991
aVEvery decision you make comes at a cost that you'll pay to implement it now and pay again to change it later so the longer you can put off making a deicsion and changing your system the better
p3992
aVSo first identify that you actually have a problem and where it is
p3993
aVProfiling, logging and other forms of performance testing will help you here
p3994
aVI can't stress enough how important this step is
p3995
aVThe number of times I've seen people "optimize" something that isn't a problem is staggering
p3996
aVOk, so you have a performance problem
p3997
aVSay your pages are running a query that takes a long time
p3998
aVIf it's a read then you have a number of options:
p3999
aVRun the query as a separate process and put the result into a cache
p4000
aVAll pages simply access the cache
p4001
aVYou can update the cached version as often as is appropriate (once a day, once a week, one every 5 seconds, whatever is appropriate);
p4002
aVCache transparently through your persistence provider, ORM or whatever
p4003
aVOf course this depends on what technology you're using
p4004
aVHibernate and Ibatis for example support query result caching;
p4005
aVHave your pages run the query if the result isn't in the cache (or it's "stale", meaning it is calculated longer ago than the specified "age") and put it into the cache
p4006
aVThis has concurrency problems if two (or more) separate processes all decide they need to update the result so you end up running the same (expensive) query eight times at once
p4007
aVYou can handle this locking the cache but that creates another performance problem
p4008
aVYou can also fall back to concurrency methods in your language (eg Java 5 concurrency APIs)
p4009
aVIf it's an update (or updates take place that need to be reflected in your read cache) then it's a little more complicated because it's no good having an old value in the cache and a newer value in the database such that you then provide your pages with an inconsistent view of the data
p4010
aVBut broadly speaking there are four approaches to this:
p4011
aVUpdate the cache and then queue a request to update the relevant store;
p4012
aVWrite through caching: the cache provider may provide a mechanism to persist the update and block the caller until that change is made; and
p4013
aVWrite-behind caching: same as write-through caching but it doesn't block the caller
p4014
aVThe update happens asynchronously and separately; and
p4015
aVPersistence as a Service models: this assumes your caching mechanism supports some kind of observability (ie cache event listeners)
p4016
aVBasically an entirely separate process--unknown to the caller--listens for cache updates and persists them as necessary
p4017
aVWhich of the above methodologies you choose will depend a lot on your requirements, what technologies you're using and a whole host of other factors (eg is clustering and failover support required
p4018
aVIt's hard to be more specific than that and give you guidance on what to do without knowing much more detail about your problem (like whether or not you have a problem)

VI've seen this and personally I think it's an awful design

p4029
aVI usually also put in something like this:
p4030
aVI forget the exact syntax but basically th eidea is the user can't request a php file directly
p4031
aVIt has to be done via another RewriteRule (like the first one), which can save you a lot of headaches with sanitizing query string input plus avoid the whole problem of PHP creating globals for things you never intended (although they can still POST for this)
p4032
aVAnyway, back to why I think this is a terrible idea
p4033
aVThey do it because they tend to want some common code in every page (like a header and footer)
p4034

p4162
aVDual license: this model has the code released under two licenses (or more)

aVOne will be a commercial license
p4164
aVThe other tends to be a restrictive open source license (most commonly GPL because it's viral)
p4165
aVPersonally I think this is a poor model because you can't really take community contributions (at a source code level) like you can with a project that's purely open source
p4166
aVIt really combines the worst of both worlds;
p4167
aVCommercial Support: this is more common on projects like MySQL, Glassfish and the like
p4168
aVThe idea is that you can use the particular product for free but what you're paying for is support (and typically indemnity)
p4169
aVThe problem with this model is that the number of people willing to take their chances on the unsupported version greatly outweighs those that aren't
p4170
aVLike the previous model you tend to no longer have community development;
p4171
aVCommercial Documentation: this is a variation upon commercial support
p4172
aVThe software is free to use and you have limited documentation
p4173
aVYou can get really good documentation if you're preapred to pay for it
p4174
aVJasperReports is like this
p4175
aVI kinda like this model because the documentation tends to be cheaper than the lowest commercial support option
p4176
aVDonations: probably the least money maker but also the least intrusive
p4177
aVI think people mainly use this on projects they've made a significant time investment in as a way of defraying the cost;
p4178
aVModularization: for this one the basic software might be free the software will allow modules to be developed without having to make them open source and then you simply sell some really good modules
p4179
aVThis is perhaps the best model I can think of because you still get community development of the core product without engendering any sort of ill-will

aVConsistency: this applies to formatting, using braces, naming (variables, classes, methods) and directory layout (if you bury a source directory somewhere under /css I'm coming after you with a machete);
p4190
aVSize: if a function doesn't fit in its entirety on the screen in a normal IDE at a normal font size then you need a pretty darn good reason as to why not

p4192

VConceptually it's quite simple
p4287
aVDepending on which language you're using you will be able to convert those dates into some reference 32 or 64 bit integer, typically representing seconds since epoch (1 January 1970) otherwise known as "Unix time" or milliseconds since some other arbitrary date
p4288
aVSimply generate a random 32 or 64 bit integer between those two values
p4289
aVThis should be a one liner in any language
p4290
aVOn some platforms you can generate a time as a double (date is the integer part, time is the fractional part is one implementation)
p4291
aVThe same principle applies except you're dealing with single or double precision floating point numbers ("floats" or "doubles" in C, Java and other languages)

p4330
aV'const':
p4331
aVCan't be static
p4332
aVValue is evaluated at compile time
p4333

p4334
aVreadonly':
p4335
aVCan be either instance-level or static
p4336
aVValue is evaluated at run time
p4337
aVCan be initialized in declaration or by code in the constructor
p4338
aVCorrection: the above states const can't be static
p4339
aVThat is a misnomer
p4340
aVThey can't have the static keyword applied because they are already static

p4412
aVUnsetting CSS attributes is
p4413
aVproblematic
p4414
aVThus you are best off using classes to set and unset attributes
p4415
aVIt's easier to change (the class resides in a CSS file and isn't code), avoids problems like setting the value back to the correct original value and generally provides a cleaner solution, especially when used with a library like jQuery
p4416
aVIn jQuery, you can do:

VBack in 2002-2003 I did a lot with XSLT (and some more in 2006-2007)
p4482
aVYour mileage on this will vary but honestly I would avoid it, for several reasons:
p4483
aVThe syntax is a blinding headspin, hard to learn, hard to get right and just plain gives you a headache
p4484
aVThe templates themselves aren't too bad but throw in some gnarly XPath expressions and it just hurts;
p4485
aVFor reasonably sized documents and transforms it is relatively slow
p4486
aVWhether or not it's slow enough to be relevant to you is something you'll only find with benchmarking your scenario so don't take this as a blanket rule, more of a cautionary tale or a caveat;
p4487
aVError messages just aren't that useful and it can be hard to figure out problems
p4488
aVUnlike a more traditional approach, you can't whip out a debugger and step through an XSLT;
p4489
aVGenerating HTML with any modern Web-flavoured language (C#, Java, PHP, Python, Ruby, etc) is trivial, straightforward, easy to log and easy to debug;
p4490
aVManipulating XML is arguably more tedious and produces more code that directly manipulating objects and converting them into markup
p4491
aVThis of course will vary by what tools your chosen language provides you with
p4492
aVThe only place I can really see having an application for XSLT these days is in consuming Web services that produce XML (lots produce JSON and more easily consumed formats these days)
p4493
aVAnd even in that case I'd probably still manipulate the XML directly with, say, JAXB in Java (or similar technologies in other languages)
p4494
aVUpdate: I just came across The Death of XSLT in Web Frameworks

VIt should be pointed out that  is a questionable approach for parsing CSV files in case you come across commas in the file eg:
p4813
aVThe other thing I'll point out without knowing how you profiled is be careful about profiling this kind of low level detail
p4814
aVThe granularity of the Windows/PC timer might come into play and you may have a significant overhead in just looping so use some sort of control value
p4815
aVThat being said,  is built to handle regular expressions, which are obviously more complex than you need (and the wrong tool to deal with escaped commas anyway)
p4816
aVAlso,  creates lots of temporary objects
p4817
aVSo if you want to speed it up (and I have trouble believing that performance of this part is really an issue) then you want to do it by hand and you want to reuse your buffer objects so you're not constantly creating objects and giving the garbage collector work to do in cleaning them up
p4818
aVThe algorithm for that is relatively simple:
p4819
aVStop at every comma;
p4820
aVWhen you hit quotes continue until you hit the next set of quotes;
p4821
aVHandle escaped quotes (ie \u005c") and arguably escaped commas (\u005c,)
p4822
aVOh and to give you some idea of the cost of regex, there was a question (Java not C# but the principle was the same) where someone wanted to replace every n-th character with a string
p4823
aVI suggested using  on String
p4824
aVJon Skeet manually coded the loop
p4825
aVOut of curiosity I compared the two versions and his was an order of magnitude better
p4826
aVSo if you really want performance, it's time to hand parse
p4827
aVOr, better yet, use someone else's optimized solution like this fast CSV reader
p4828
aVBy the way, while this is in relation to Java it concerns the performance of regular expressions in general (which is universal) and  vs a hand-coded loop: Putting char into a java string for each N characters

VHeh welcome to the hair-pulling that is JPA configuration
p5126
aVIn your case you have two choices:
p5127
aVManually persist the new object; or
p5128
aVAutomatically persist it
p5129
aVTo automatically persist it you need to annotate the relationship
p5130
aVThis is a common one-to-many idiom:
p5131
aVBecause of the cascade persist this will work
p5132
aVNote: You have to manage the relationship at a Java level yourself, hence manually setting the parent
p5133
aVThis is important
p5134
aVWithout it you need to manually persist the object
p5135
aVYou'll need an EntityManager to do that, in which case it is as simple as:
p5136
aVAt which point it will work correctly (assuming everything else does)
p5137
aVFor purely child entities I would favour the annotation approach
p5138
aVIt's just easier
p5139
aVThere is one gotcha I'll mention with JPA:
p5140
aVNow I'm a little rusty on this but I believe that you may run into problems if you do this because the parent was persisted before the child was added
p5141

VThere's a combination of techniques:
p5259
aVFirstly, they need to understand what the application does
p5260
aVSounds trite I know but I've worked in trading applications and it can take people a long time to get their head around what, say, a market maker does because that's built on top of a lot of knowledge about how financial markets operate and what they do
p5261
aVJust a term like "spread" has all sorts of assumed knowledge built into it
p5262
aVThis should be done interactively rather than handing someone a tutorial or a user manual
p5263
aVAlso, and this is really important, the user user should drive
p5264
aVUsing the mouse and keyboard rather than watching is what builds muscle memory and ingrained responses
p5265
aVYou'll get much better retention rates that way
p5266
aVAlso, rather than saying "click here now do this" put them on the spot and ask them "what would you do here"
p5267
aVYou can often get a useful insight into the usability of your application this way since the new person isn't tainted by all the history that you and your existing team has
p5268
aVYou can't teach someone everything but show them enough that they can navigate around the application and do simple tasks
p5269
aVSecondly, give them an architectural overview
p5270
aVIf this takes more than an hour or two you're going into too much detail
p5271
aVThey'll simply forget it
p5272
aVI find it's better to actually give this as a face to face talk rather than handing them an architectural design document (which generally just causes people eyes to glaze over)
p5273
aVLastly, give them small, relatively easy bugs to fix that aren't time critical
p5274
aVThis will get them familiar with the basics of checking out the code, building it, deploying it, running it, etc
p5275
aVIt's important that it's simple because things always go wrong with new code
p5276
aVYou might need the right environment variable set up to properly build the code or whatever
p5277
aVGive them a complex problem and if something goes wrong they'll get lost in figuring out if its environment, if it's because they're doing something wrong and so on
p5278
aVIt also goes without saying that you can't leave them in a corner to figure this out
p5279
aVSomeone eneds to keep an eye on them to make sure they don't get bogged down
p5280
aVThis will also give you a good insight into their personality: what happens when they get stuck
p5281
aVDo they freeze up
p5282
aVDo they ask for help
p5283

p5361
aVNo more
p5362
aVIf you have multiple compact them into one (each)
p5363
aVIdeally, your Javascript should also be minified
p5364
aVI've been using JSMin for this lately
p5365
aVThere are some more advanced techniques to optimize this further
p5366
aVYou set the expires header to far in the future so the browser doesn't download it as often
p5367
aVTo push changes you need to change the link to the css/js file though

p5369
aVMore on this in What is an elegant way to force browsers to reload cached CSS/JS files

aVSecondly, gzip your constent
p5372
aVTypically all you have to do for this in PHP is start all your scripts wiht:

VStatic data is only static within the context of a class, meaning a static data member in a class is shared by all instances of that class
p5519
aVWhat you seem to be talking about is data persisting across multiple HTTP requests
p5520
aVStatic data won't do that for you
p5521
aVThat's what $_SESSION data is for
p5522
aVTo put it another way: once a script finishes servicing the current request, it completely dies
p5523
aVAll data is had is completely cleaned up
p5524
aVThe new request starts fresh
p5525
aVSession data persists until PHP decides to clean it up or you manually destroy it
p5526
aVTypically all you have to do to use session data is put in your script:
p5527
aVScript 1: mailbox
p5528
aVphp
p5529
aVScript 2: showmail
p5530
aVphp
p5531
aVOne thing to note: if your script is long-running try and put a session_commit() in as soon as possible because session access blocks in PHP, meaning if another script tries to session_start() for the same user it will block until the first script finishes executing or releases the session

p5538
aVYes it has objects
p5539
aVYes they support inheritance and all those OO principles
p5540
aVIt supports objects
p5541
aVThere's a difference
p5542
aVI say this because PHP doesn't by default exist in a state between requests
p5543
aVEvery single HTTP request will completely recreate a PHP environment from scratch (which is reasonably cheap), meaning there is no static data persisted between requests
p5544
aVYou might say "what about session data
p5545
aV(and maybe append an "a ha
p5546
aVbut that isn't persistent data in a PHP sense either
p5547
aVIt's (typically) stored in the filesystem and keyed by a cookie the client sends
p5548
aVWhy do I mention these two things
p5549
aVBecause the "global" scope in not like the global scope in C, Java, C++ or these other languages because they tend to persist between requests
p5550
aVPHP is more like the CGI programming model from the 90s (which is no coincidence because that's where it originated)
p5551
aVSo your objects aren't truly global: they are simply visible to all parts of the code servicing the current request
p5552
aVTo me, that's nowhere near as bad
p5553
aVIn fact, I often find it quite acceptable
p5554
aVSometimes it's every necessary (eg in a callback to preg_replace_callback if you want to send information back to the caller or pass state to the callback without doing eval()/create_function() hacks)
p5555
aVAnd the point about PHP not being object-oriented is because even in PHP 5 OO features are still somewhat "tacked on", meaning you could quite happily code away and code well in PHP without ever using them
p5556
aVThis is different to, say, Java where you have to create a class even if all you do is write a bunch of static methods in it
p5557
aVSo if you want to learn OO, honestly I wouldn't do it in PHP
p5558
aVPHP is good for a lot of things but it's designed to have an HTTP request lifecycle (yes I know you can run it from the command line but that's not what the vast majority of users do) and it's quite good at the job it's designed for

VThis is touching on two separate issues
p5658
aVFirstly, session hijacking
p5659
aVThis is where a third party discovers, say, an authenticated cookie and gains access to someone else's details
p5660
aVSecondly, there is session data security
p5661
aVBy this I mean that you store data in the cookie (such as the username)
p5662
aVThis is not a good idea
p5663
aVAny such data is fundamentally untrustworthy just like HTML form data is untrustworthy (irrespective of what Javascript validation and/or HTML length restrictions you use, if any) because a client is free to submit what they want
p5664
aVYou'll often find people (rightly) advocating sanitizing HTML form data but cookie data will be blindly accepted on face value
p5665
aVBig mistake
p5666
aVIn fact, I never store any information in the cookie
p5667
aVI view it as a session key and that's all
p5668
aVIf you intend to store data in a cookie I strongly advise you to reconsider
p5669
aVEncryption of this data does not make the information any more trustworth because symmetric encryption is susceptible to brute-force attack
p5670
aVObviously AES-256 is better than, say, DES (heh) but 256-bits of security doesn't necessarily mean as much as you think it does
p5671
aVFor one thing, SALTs are typically generated according to an algorithm or are otherwise susceptible to attack
p5672
aVFor another, cookie data is a prime candidate for crib attacks
p5673
aVIf it is known or suspected that a username is in the encrypted data will hey, there's your crib
p5674
aVThis brings us back to the first point: hijacking
p5675
aVIt should be pointed out that on shared-hosting environments in PHP (as one example) your session data is simply stored on the filesystem and is readable by anyone else on that same host although they don't necessarily know which site it is for
p5676
aVSo never store plaintext passwords, credit card numbers, extensive personal details or anything that might otherwise be deemed as sensitive in session data in such environments without some form of encryption or, better yet, just storing a key in the session and storing the actual sensitive data in a database
p5677
aVNote: the above is not unique to PHP
p5678
aVBut that's server side encryption
p5679
aVNow you could argue that encrypting a session with some extra data will make it more secure from hijacking
p5680
aVA common example is the user's IP address
p5681
aVProblem is many people use the same PC/laptop at many different locations (eg Wifi hotspots, work, home)
p5682
aVAlso many environments will use a variety of IP addresses as the source address, particularly in corporate environments
p5683
aVYou might also use the user agent but that's guessable
p5684
aVSo really, as far as I can tell, there's no real reason to use cookie encryption at all
p5685
aVI never did think there was but in light of this question I went looking to be proven either right or wrong
p5686
aVI found a few threads about people suggesting ways to encrypt cookie data, transparently do it with Apache modules, and so on but these all seemed motivated by protecting data stored in a cookie (which imho you shouldn't do)
p5687
aVI've yet to see a security argument for encrypting a cookie that represents nothing more than a session key
p5688
aVI will happily be proven wrong if someone can point out something to the contrary

VThe obvious thing you can do is not open a database connection until you need it
p5922
aVI personally use code like this:
p5923
aVto reduce the amount of repetitive and to only open a connection when you need one
p5924
aVIn your case you then need to break off the smallest chunk you can to begin with
p5925
aVIdeally it should be a vertical slice, meaning this slice will do almost all of its database work with the new code and very little with the old

VI would be incredibly surprised if you even need to load all your information in memory
p6036
aVI say this because, just as one example, I'm working on a Web app at the moment that (for various reasons) loads thousands of records on many pages
p6037
aVThis is PHP + MySQL
p6038
aVAnd even so it can do it and render a page in well under 100ms
p6039
aVBefore you go down this route make sure that you have to
p6040
aVFirst make your database as performant as possible
p6041
aVNow obviously this includes things like having appropriate indexes and tuning your database but even though are putting the horse before the cart
p6042
aVFirst and foremost you need to make sure you have a good relational data model: one that lends itself to performant queries
p6043
aVThis is as much art as it is science
p6044
aVAlso, you may like NHibernate but ORMs are not always the best choice
p6045
aVThere are some corner cases, for example, that hand-coded SQL will be vastly superior in
p6046
aVNow assuming you have a good data model and assuming you've then optimized your indexes and database parameters and then you've properly configured NHibernate, then and only then should you consider storing data in memory if and only if performance is still an issue
p6047
aVTo put this in perspective, the only times I've needed to do this are on systems that need to perform millions of transactions per day
p6048
aVOne reason to avoid in-memory caching is because it adds a lot of complexity
p6049
aVYou have to deal with issues like cache expiry, independent updates to the underlying data store, whether you use synchronous or asynchronous updates, how you give the client a consistent (if not up-to-date) view of your data, how you deal with failover and replication and so on
p6050
aVThere is a huge complexity cost to be paid
p6051
aVAssuming you've done all the above and you still need it, it sounds to me like what you need is a cache or grid solution
p6052
aVHere is an overview of Java grid/cluster solutions but many of them (eg Coherence, memcached) apply to

aVAnother choice for
p6055

p6056
aVIt needs to be pointed out and stressed that something like NHibernate is only consistent so long as nothing externally updates the database and that there is exactly one NHibernate-enabled process (barring clustered solutions)

aVConsider the alternative using jQuery and the superfish (inspired by suckefish) plug-in:

p6312
aVIf you do go the (semi-)pure CSS route, I highly recommend you use one of the existing frameworks for this (like suckerfish or a derivative)

p6314
aVTo answer your question about depth: that rule you mentioned essentially is going to infinite depth
p6315
aVRemember a space in CSS is a descendant selector not a child selector
p6316
aVThe reason for the repeated groups is so that the rule only applies from (say) the third level down
p6317
aVThat's because the first and second levels will have special stylings
p6318
aVThe first will be a horitzontal or vertical bar
p6319
aVThe second will popout from that but from the third level down it will consistently popout in the same way

p6326
aVWow, times have changed
p6327
aVThat was what
p6328
aVJava 1
p6329
aV3
p6330
aVFirstly, language features:
p6331
aVGenerics: Java added generics in the 5
p6332
aV0 release in 2004, basically as syntactic sugar to stop you do all those casts from Objects out of collections;
p6333
aVAnnotations: also in Java 5
p6334
aVUsed extensively in persistence frameworks, Spring and elsewhere;
p6335
aVTypesafe enums: Java 5 added an enum type, which is basically a class (sort of);
p6336
aVConcurrency: Java 5 added extensive concurrency utils so multithreading has changed a lot; and
p6337
aVAsserts: a highly underused language feature added in Java 1
p6338
aV4
p6339
aVIf enabled when you run your program, assets can check for various conditions and bomb out if they aren't true
p6340
aVThe fact that you can turn them on or off when you run your program is great for diagnostics
p6341
aVThing is though, the above aren't even the big changes
p6342
aVIn the early part of this decade, Java underwent radical architectural and philosophical changes
p6343
aVBack in 2001 the big things were EJB, Swing and servlets/JSP
p6344
aVNone of them really are anymore (at least not directly)
p6345
aVProably the biggest thing to happen in Java (since its inception imho) is Spring and Spring really became big about 5 years ago
p6346
aVSpring is a lightweight container that also seeks to hide implementation differences between different providers and APIs
p6347
aVThe biggest thing about Spring however is the principle of "inversion of control" or "dependency injection"
p6348
aVThe idea is that classes ("beans") are assembled from an external config ("application context")
p6349
aVA typical pattern in the earlier J2EE days was the Service Locator
p6350
aVIt's now viewed largely as an anti-pattern
p6351
aVBasically you'd see code like this:
p6352
aVIf you go around advocating this sort of approach these days you will be viewed as an anachronism, a rank amateur, a crackpot or some combination of the three
p6353
aVDependency injection, in its simplest form, will instead inject the necessary behaviour into classes without regard for the actual implementation
p6354
aVThis kind of separation is deceptively powerful and a profound shift that Sun (still) hasn't really caugh tup with
p6355
aVIt also greatly enhances unit testing
p6356
aVSwing is still around but not so big anymore
p6357
aVSun released JavaFX as a Flash competitor and applet replacement in recent months
p6358
aVI personally don't think it has much of a future (as Joel put it in his recent podcast, Java on the desktop is basically dead) but others will disagree
p6359
aVEJB was big in 2001
p6360
aVNot so much anymore
p6361
aVIt was (correctly) viewed as a nightmare of XML configuration, differences in application servers that made them largely non-portable (or non-trivially portable if you prefer) and they're such a heavyweight solution (pre-3
p6362
aV0) that they don't really have that many applications
p6363
aVEJB 3
p6364
aV0 has taken a much more Spring-like approach of dependency injection (sort of) and annotations of POJOs (plain old Java objects)
p6365
aVServlets and JSP were big in 2001
p6366
aVStruts began then or soon thereafter and was big until a few years ago
p6367
aVIt's now been surpassed by other more modern Web frameworks (like Struts 2--no real relation to STruts 1 despite the name--Spring MVC, Seam and so on)
p6368
aVThe big thing these days--not just in Java--is of coruse the Web and RIAs
p6369
aVFlash/Flex and Javascript/HTML/CSS (plus frameworks) rule the roost here these days (and yes theres GWT but it has a small following)
p6370
aVWeblogic and Websphere aren't as big as they were in 2001
p6371
aVJBoss still has a lot of momentum but my appserver of choice these days is Sun's Glassfish v2 or v3 Prelude
p6372
aVIDEs have also changed
p6373
aVJBuilder was big in 2001
p6374
aVNow there are only really three: Eclipse, Netbeans and IntelliJ (probalby in that order of popularity but my preference is IntelliJ, which is also the only commercial one of the bunch)

VFor any kind of grammar-based parsing, regular expressions are usually an awful solution
p6472
aVEven smple grammars (like arithmetic) have nesting and it's on nesting (in particular) that regular expressions just fall over
p6473
aVFortunately PHP provides a far, far better solution for you by giving you access to the same lexical analyzer used by the PHP interpreter via the token_get_all() function
p6474
aVGive it a character stream of PHP code and it'll parse it into tokens ("lexemes"), which you can do a bit of simple parsing on with a pretty simple finite state machine
p6475
aVRun this program (it's run as test
p6476
aVphp so it tries it on itself)
p6477
aVThe file is deliberately formatted badly so you can see it handles that with ease
p6478
aVOutput:
p6479
aVThis is basically a finite state machine that looks for the pattern:
p6480
aVin the lexical stream of a PHP source file and treats the two constants as a (name,value) pair
p6481
aVIn doing so it handles nested define() statements (as per the results) and ignores whitespace and comments as well as working across multiple lines
p6482
aVNote: I've deliberatley made it ignore the case when functions and variables are constant names or values but you can extend it to that as you wish
p6483
aVIt's also worth pointing out that PHP is quite forgiving when it comes to strings
p6484
aVThey can be declared with single quotes, double quotes or (in certain circumstances) with no quotes at all
p6485
aVThis can be (as pointed out by Gumbo) be an ambiguous reference reference to a constant and you have no way of knowing which it is (no guaranteed way anyway), giving you the chocie of:
p6486
aVIgnoring that style of strings (T_STRING);
p6487
aVSeeing if a constant has already been declared with that name and replacing it's value
p6488
aVThere's no way you can know what other files have been called though nor can you process any defines that are conditionally created so you can't say with any certainty if anything is definitely a constant or not nor what value it has; or
p6489
aVYou can just live with the possibility that these might be constants (which is unlikely) and just treat them as strings

VI expect here the problem is your getComments() function (for which more detail is required)
p6497
aVYou're supplying a third argument being a callback but does the function actually use a callback
p6498
aVWhat is it doing
p6499
aVCertain jQuery functions provide callbacks but this isn't an automatic feature
p6500
aVIf you're waiting for a user to type a comment you need to trigger the relevant event when they click "Done" or whatever they do
p6501
aVOk, try this:
p6502
aVNote: the difference here is that a third argument is supplied to get_comments() which is a callback that'll be called at the end of your $
p6503
aVgetJSON() callback
p6504
aVThat'll give you the proper ordering you want
p6505
aVI might also suggest not constructing the HTML like that but including it in your page and hiding/unhiding it as necessary
p6506
aVIt tends to be much more performant that dynamic HTML and have less issues (eg new HTML, unless you use $()
p6507
aVlive() will not have relevant event handlers)

p6533
aVWhat you're stumbling towards is a generic Party model
p6534
aVBasically you have a Party entity with subtypes such as Person and Organisation
p6535
aVContacts has a Party ID as a foreign key
p6536
aVThe use of a common superclass/superentity is much more profound than that however as you will find that you use this for many other things as well (eg the whole role concept)

p6548

p6549
aVThere's a difference

aVYou're touching on the issue of coding standards it seems like (as well)

aVWikis allow you to write stuff, collaborate, insert class diagrams or whatever is appropriate
p6554

p6555
aVMy way of thinking is that you just
p6556
aVdon't write "technical specs" that
p6557
aVcover the entire functionality of an
p6558
aVapplication
p6559
aVthat's what the
p6560
aVfunctional spec is for
p6561
aVOnce you have
p6562
aVa complete functional spec the only
p6563
aVthing left to document is points of
p6564
aVinternal architecture and specific
p6565
aValgorithms that are (a) entirely
p6566
aVinvisible (under the covers) and (b)
p6567
aVnot obvious enough from the functional
p6568
aVspec
p6569
aVSo the technical spec winds up not
p6570
aVexisting
p6571
aVIn it's place you may or may
p6572
aVnot have a few technical articles on
p6573

aVRemember, if anything you're talking

p6577
aVeven the behavior of the thing you're

aVbuilding, it goes in the functional

aVall of these questions are, at best, secondary
p6613
aVI actually find it bizarre how much "table hatred" there is out there but, as has been documented countless times, if you want to do some things (like vertical centering) and have it compatible back to IE6 there's no quicker, easier and more compatible solution

aVThe only thing I'm "for" is that it works

p6617
aVWith all of these things (tables, absolute positioning, pure CSS, etc) in most cases you're not solving all your problems, you're simply trading one set of problems for another
p6618
aVThat might be OK because in the context of what you're doing one set of problems might be preferable but there is no magic bullet (be it absolute positioning or anything else)

VFrankly I think the open/closed principle is more an anachronism than not
p6693
aVIt sems from the 80s and 90s when OO frameworks were built on the principle that everything must inherit from something else and that everything should be subclassable
p6694
aVThis was most typified in UI frameworks of the era like MFC and Java Swing
p6695
aVIn Swing, you have ridiculous inheritance where (iirc) button extends checkbox (or the other way around) giving one of them behaviour that isn't used (I think it's its the setDisabled() call on checkbox)
p6696
aVWhy do they share an ancestry
p6697
aVNo reason other than, well, they had some methods in common
p6698
aVThese days composition is favoured over inheritance
p6699
aVWhereas Java allowed inheritance by default,
p6700
aVNet took the (more modern) approach of disallowing it by default, which I think is more correct (and more consistent with Josh Bloch's principles)
p6701
aVDI/IoC have also further made the case for composition
p6702
aVJosh Bloch also points out that inheritance breaks encapsulation and gives some good examples of why

VSome use an obfuscator like Zend Guard but honestly I think that technical solutions for this kind of problem are as doomed as DRM is for audio and video content
p6711
aVFundamentally what you've giving them is meant to work so it's just a technical problem to make it work in ways you don't want
p6712
aVYour recourses here are (imho) legal not technical
p6713
aVYou have a contract with the client that lays out what they can and can't do

aVYou have a good lawyer draft that contract
p6715
aVIf they don't abide by it then you pretty much have to take them to court
p6716
aVDon't count on any form of obfuscation or copy protection as any kind of guarantee

aVThis is particularly a problem for scripting languages because (Zend notwithstanding), they are fundamentallly plaintext distribution methods
p6718
aVJava and
p6719
aVNet and other bytecode compiled languages have a little more protection but they can be disassembled into intermediate code too (but obfuscation is more useful here)

p6759
aVYou may not have touched the project from work--which was a good move by the way--but many employment contracts border on the draconian and they may own the rights to what you do in your free time, particularly in this case where what you're doing has commonality with your employment
p6760
aVPotentially they may even argue that the backup solution is directly or indirectly a product of what you do for them so they have a claim to the rights (or a portion thereof)

VI actually think this is a pretty good question
p6772
aVThere are a few ways of looking at this
p6773
aVFirstly, this could be seen negatively for one reason: one thing you can do in a normal interview to sort the wheat from the chaff is ask them what they know about your company and industry
p6774
aVThe good candidates--those that are keen to work for you and generally eager and inquisitive--will have looked you up and at least gone to your website (if you have one) and found out what it is you do
p6775
aVSo by asking them this upfront you are losing the opportunity to see how much initiative they take
p6776
aVOf course you make up for this in other areas eg by asking off-book questions that a reasonable person may have looked up anyway
p6777
aVThe other potential negative is that it can often be hard to understand an industry, a business or a product from the outside looking in
p6778
aVI worked in stockbroking, for example, and it's not until you get to a place like that that you can see all the different teams (eg New Accounts, Compliance, Settlements, Accounts, Call Centre and so on) and get an understanding of what they do and why they do it
p6779
aVUnderstadning the culture is also hard without being a part of it
p6780
aVSo Brann is right in that you want someone who is capable of understanding it rather than someone who actually does
p6781
aVYou might be excluding good potential hires who will pick up your business quite quickly
p6782
aVThat being said, I like where you're going with the question
p6783
aVForcing a candidate to think about things like that is a good idea
p6784
aVPerhaps you could narrow the focus to a single aspect of your business, which is more digestable in a typically hour-long interview
p6785
aVThis will also allow you to give you the opportunity to see how much initative they took beyond the scope of the original question

aVIf you do go this way, don't get to the right page with external redirects

p6794
aVmod_rewrite will be much more efficient at doing this
p6795

VThis is arguably more art than science
p6880
aVWhat you have to remember is that like many things in programming and IT, your website will be as slow as the slowest link in the chain, meaning you will have some bottleneck such as bandwidth, the Web servers, disk I/O, memory, your databases, your firewall, etc that will limit the speed of your Website
p6881
aVTuning and growing your Web site will involve identifying those issues as you grow and addressing them
p6882
aVAt one point you may need to add more RAM, at another you may need another CPU and so on
p6883
aVAt other times adding more memory might be useless because memory isn't your problem
p6884
aVLikewise, lack of a certain resource can be masked, like lack of memory can be masked by intensive disk I/O as your system swaps (page faults) constantly but disk I/O isn't the problem
p6885
aVSo what do you do
p6886
aVThe first thing is you need to identify (or make a reasonable guess) as to what a typical user will do and how much they will do it
p6887
aVIdeally you will be able to model 100 or 1000 or however many users you need with software like JMeter to then get an idea of how your Website scales, how much bandwidth is going to be required and so on
p6888
aVBy modelling 100, 500, 1000, 2000 users you will hopefully be able to see how linearly you Web site scales
p6889
aVYou may find that supporting 1000 users requires 1 gig of RAM but 2000 requires 4 gigs: that's an example of non-linear scalability that expoes a problem you will have scaling your Web site up
p6890
aVAnd that's the kind of thing to be revealed by performance testing
p6891
aVHonestly though, hardware is so cheap these days that it's rarely a problem except for the biggest and most popular of sites ($10k can buy you 1 or even 2 servers with 16G of RAM and 4-8 cores each)
p6892
aVShared and VPS hosting are a different story because you'll typically only want to pay for however much memory, bandwidth and disk space you need
p6893
aVLuckily those kinds of solutions tend to alow you to upgrade pretty easily (at least to a point where you'll eventually have to go dedicating hosting)
p6894
aVYou can make some dirty estimates at the beginning of a project by doing what they call "back of the envelope" estimation
p6895
aVRun key queries say 100 times and work out hwo much CPU time they require, hit a mocked up page 100 times and work out how much bandwidth it generates and so on
p6896
aVThese rough estimates combined with guesses about how users will use the site will give you a ballpark (hopefully within a factor of 2-3) of what you'll need

VA number of a series of digits
p7033
aVA 32 bit unsigned int is 32 binary digits
p7034
aVThe string "12345" is a series of 5 digits
p7035
aVDigits can be stored in many ways: as bits, characters, array elements and so on
p7036
aVThe largest "native" datatype in C# with complete precision is probably the decimal type (128 bits, 28-29 digits)
p7037
aVJust choose your own method of storing digits that allows you to store much bigger numbers
p7038
aVAs for the rest, this will give you a clue:
p7039
aV21 = 2
p7040
aV22 = 21 + 21
p7041
aV23 = 22 + 22
p7042
aVExample:
p7043
aVSPOILER ALERT: Algorithm and solution in C# follows
p7044
aVBasically, as alluded to a number is nothing more than an array of digits
p7045
aVThis can be represented easily in two ways:
p7046
aVAs a string;
p7047
aVAs an array of characters or digits
p7048
aVAs others have mentioned, storing the digits in reverse order is actually advisable
p7049
aVIt makes the calculations much easier
p7050
aVI tried both of the above methods
p7051
aVI found strings and the character arithmetic irritating (it's easier in C/C++; the syntax is just plain annoying in C#)
p7052
aVThe first thing to note is that you can do this with one array
p7053
aVYou don't need to allocate more storage at each iteration
p7054
aVAs mentioned you can find a power of 2 by doubling the previous power of 2
p7055
aVSo you can find 21000 by doubling 1 one thousand times
p7056
aVThe doubling can be done in place with the general algorithm:
p7057
aVThis algorithm is basically the same for using a string or an array
p7058
aVAt the end you just add up the digits
p7059
aVA naive implementation might add the results into a new array or string with each iteration
p7060
aVBad idea
p7061
aVReally slows it down
p7062
aVAs mentioned, it can be done in place
p7063
aVBut how large should the array be
p7064
aVWell that's easy too
p7065
aVMathematically you can convert 2^a to 10^f(a) where f(a) is a simple logarithmic conversion and the number of digits you need is the next higher integer from that power of 10
p7066
aVFor simplicity, you can just use:
p7067
aVwhich is a close approximation and sufficient
p7068
aVWhere you can really optimise this is by using larger digits
p7069
aVA 32 bit signed int can store a number between +/- 2 billion (approximately
p7070
aVWell 9 digits equals a billion so you can use a 32 bit int (signed or unsigned) as basically a base one billion "digit"
p7071
aVYou can work out how many ints you need, create that array and that's all the storage you need to run the entire algorithm (being 130ish bytes) with everything being done in place

VThe general rule of thumb here is that server roundtrips are expensive (relative to how long a typical query takes) so the guiding principle is that you want to minimize them
p7165
aVBasically each one-to-many join will potentially multiply your result set so the way I approach this is to keep joining until the result set gets too large or the query execution time gets too long (roughly 1-5 seconds generally)
p7166
aVDepending on your platform you may or may not be able to execute queries in parallel
p7167
aVThis is a key determinant in what you should do because if you can only execute one query at a time the barrier to breaking up a query is that much higher
p7168
aVSometimes it's worth keeping certain relatively constant data in memory (country information, for example) or doing them as a separately query but this is, in my experience, reasonably unusual

p7241
aVThere is very little one can do that the other can't but the out-of-the-box configs tend to differ somewhat
p7242
aVThe most obvious difference is that Oracle uses SEQUENCEs and SQL Server uses auto-increment columns
p7243
aVThere are pros and cons to each
p7244
aVSome prefer one over the other
p7245
aVFrom my experience doing Top N queries in SQL Server seems a little easier than Oracle
p7246
aVOut of the box Oracle uses MVCC (uncommitted data is non-blocking to reads by other transactions--the database maintains a consistent view)
p7247
aVSQL Server I only discovered recently has this too but it's not the default option and is called something quite different
p7248
aVTransaction isolation level or something
p7249
aVPL/SQL and T-SQL are reasonably different in syntax in some areas but the concepts are mostly the same
p7250
aVPersonally I found SQL Server management Studio to be OK but horrendous in some areas, like its data import/export just didn't work with auto increment primary keys
p7251
aVThis was a known bug going back years on SQL Server 2005
p7252
aVI don't know if they've fixed it in 2008 or not
p7253
aVWith PL/SQL Developer (doesn't ship as part of Oracle; it's a separate commercial product) imports and exports were a breeze
p7254
aVOracle has an annoying limit on VARCHAR(2) columsn: limited to 4k in length
p7255
aVThey're much longer in SQL Server (64k
p7256
aVI found the SQL Server security model just bizarre
p7257
aVTCP was disabled by default (Windows authentication only) and then you had to setup a logon and a user
p7258
aVI never quite got that
p7259
aVIt just seemed to be to be overly complicated whereas in Oracle its just:
p7260
aVDone (although granting some other privileges/roles like RESOURCE is pretty common)
p7261
aVI never quite figured out the backup/restore from the managemen tstudio
p7262
aVRecover would fail saying someone was connected to the database but that someone was me attempting to run the recover
p7263

VIt's a hard comparison to make because differences in the respective stacks mean you end up doing the same thing differently and if you do them the same for the purpose of comparison it's not a very realistic test
p7270
aVPHP, which I like, is in its most basic form loaded with every request, interpreted and then discarded
p7271
aVIt is very much like CGI in this respect (which is no surprise considering it is roughly 15 years old)
p7272
aVNow over the years various optimisations have been made to improve the performance, most notably opcode caching with APC, for example (so much so that APC will be a standard part of PHP 6 and not an optional module like it is now)
p7273
aVBut still PHP scripts are basically transient
p7274
aVSession information is (normally) file based and mutually exclusive (session_start() blocks other scripts accessing the same user session until session_commit() or the script finishes) whereas that's not the case in ASP
p7275
aVNET
p7276
aVAside from session data, it's fairly easy (and normal) to have objects that live within the application context in ASP
p7277
aVNET (or Java for that matter, which ASP
p7278
aVNET is much more similar to)
p7279
aVThis is a key difference
p7280
aVFor example, database access in PHP (using mysql, mysqli, PDO, etc) is transient (persistent connections notwithstanding) whereas
p7281
aVNet/Java will nearly always use persistent connection pools and build on top of this to create ORM frameworks and the like, the caches for which are beyond any particular request
p7282
aVAs a bytecode interpreted platform, ASP
p7283
aVNET is theoretically faster but the limits to what PHP can do are so high as to be irrelevant for most people
p7284
aV4 of the top 20 visited sites on the internet are PHP for example
p7285
aVSpeed of development, robustness, cost of running the environment, etc
p7286
aVtend to be far more important when you start to scale than any theoretical speed difference
p7287
aVBear in mind that
p7288
aVNet has primitive types, type safety and these sorts of things that will make code faster than PHP can run it
p7289
aVIf you want to do a somewhat unfair test, sort an array of one million random 64 bit integers in both platforms
p7290
aVASP
p7291
aVNET will kill it because they are primitive types and simple arrays will be more efficient than PHP's associative arrays (and all arrays in PHP are associative ultimately)
p7292
aVPlus PHP on a 32 bit OS won't have a native 64 bit integer so will suffer hugely for that
p7293
aVIt should also be pointed out that ASP
p7294
aVNET is pre-compiled whereas PHP is interpreted on-the-fly (excluding opcode caching), which can make a difference but the flexibility of PHP in this regard is a good thing

aVXSS (Cross site scripting): generally speaking you should strip out HTML tags from user input

VSpring is the obvious one you should be using
p7704
aVGWT has its own RPC controller framework so I can't really think what you would need a Web application framework (like JSF) for
p7705
aVJPA is a reasonable choice on several fronts but it has problems too
p7706
aVFor one thing, its potentially an issue sending JPA objects to the client
p7707
aVGWT (up to 1
p7708
aV5 at least) enforces a pretty strict directory structure so you'd have to put your entities under the GWT source tree
p7709
aVThat aside, serializing (JSON usually) JPA entities to and from the client is potentially problematic
p7710
aVJPA entities are fairly rigid objects that map almost one-to-one to your tables
p7711
aVThat doesn't tend to be how you use data in a presentation layer however
p7712
aVDirect SQL will allow you to pick and choose which data you do and don't want, tailored specifically for that page
p7713
aVSo JPA entities will typically have lots of fields you're not interested in and shouldn't serialize (particularly collections of one-to-many relationships)
p7714
aVNow that aspect of SQL--tailoring it to the page--is often cited as an advantage of entities: your code doesn't end up littered with one-use value objects
p7715
aVThing is, you still end up with the same thing in gWT+JPA but instead of being in the persistence layer or the business layer you end up with them in the presentation layer
p7716
aVNow you might call that an advantage
p7717
aVI call it six of one, half a dozen of the other
p7718
aVI actually think Ibatis is a far better fit to the GWT application model than JPA for the reason that you are using direct SQL, objects tailored for your purpose and those objects can be used all the way from the database to the client

VLet me take a crack at this
p7755
aVFirst of, I've written some on this subject in Using an ORM or plain SQL
p7756
aVSpecifically to address your points:
p7757
aVLearning Curve/Ease of Use
p7758
aVIbatis is about SQL
p7759
aVIf you know SQL the learning curve for ibatis is trivial
p7760
aVIbatis does some things on top of SQL such as:
p7761
aVgroup by;
p7762
aVdiscriminated types; and
p7763
aVdynamic SQL
p7764
aVthat you'll still need to learn but the biggest hurdle is SQL
p7765
aVJPA (which includes Hibernate) on the other hand tries to distance itself from SQL and present things in an object rather than a relational way
p7766
aVAs Joel points out however, abstractions are leaky and JPA is no exception
p7767
aVTo do JPA you'll still need to know about relational models, SQL, performance tuning of queries and so forth
p7768
aVWhereas Ibatis will simply having you apply the SQL you know or are learning, JPA will require you to know something else: how to configure it (either XML or annotations)
p7769
aVBy this I mean figuring out that foreign key relationships are a relationship (one-to-one, one-to-many or many-to-many) of some kind, the type mapping, etc
p7770
aVIf you know SQL I would say the barrier to learning JPA is actually higher
p7771
aVIf you don't, it's more of a mixed result with JPA allowing you to effectively defer learning SQL for a time (but it doesn't put it off indefinitely)
p7772
aVWith JPA once you setup your entities and their relationships then other developers can simply use them and don't need to learn everything about configuring JPA
p7773
aVThis could be an advantage but a developer will still need to know about entity managers, transaction management, managed vs unmanaged objects and so on
p7774
aVIt's worth noting that JPA also has its own query language (JPA-SQL), which you will need to learn whether or not you know SQL
p7775
aVYou will find situations where JPA-SQL just can't do things that SQL can
p7776
aVProductivity
p7777
aVThis is a hard one to judge
p7778
aVPersonally I think I'm more productive in ibatis but I'm also really comfortable with SQL
p7779
aVSome will argue they're way more productive with Hibernate but this is possibly due--at least in part--to unfamiliarity with SQL
p7780
aVAlso the productivity with JPA is deceptive because you will occasionally come across a problem with your data model or queries that takes you a half a day to a day to solve as you turn up logging and watch what SQL your JPA provider is producing and then working out the combination of settings and calls to get it to produce something that's both correct and performant
p7781
aVYou just don't have this kind of problem with Ibatis because you've written the SQL yourself
p7782
aVYou test it by running the SQL inside PL/SQL Developer, SQL Server Management Studio, Navicat for MySQL or whatever
p7783
aVAfter the query is right, all you're doing is mapping inputs and outputs
p7784
aVAlso I found JPA-QL to be more awkward than pure SQL
p7785
aVYou need separate tools to just run a JPA-QL query to see the results and it's something more you have to learn
p7786
aVI actually found this whole part of JPA rather awkward and unwieldy although some people love it
p7787
aVMaintainability/Stability
p7788
aVThe danger with Ibatis here is proliferation meaning your dev team may just keep adding value objects and queries as they need them rather than looking for reuse whereas JPA has one entitty per table and once you have that entity, that's it
p7789
aVNamed queries tend to go on that entity so are hard to miss
p7790
aVAd-hoc queries can still be repeated but I think it's less of a potential problem
p7791
aVThat comes at the cost of rigidity however
p7792
aVOften in an application you will need bits and pieces of data from different tables
p7793
aVWith SQL it's easy because you can write a single query (or a small number of queries) to get all that data in one hit and put it in a custom value object just for that purpose
p7794
aVWith JPA you are moving up that logic into your business layer
p7795
aVEntities are basically all or nothing
p7796
aVNow that's not strictly true
p7797
aVVarious JPA providers will allow you to partially load entities and so forth but even there you're talking about the same discrete entitites
p7798
aVIf you need data from 4 tables you either need 4 entities or you need to combine the data you want into some kind of custom value object in the business or presentation layer
p7799
aVOne other thing I like about ibatis is that all your SQL is external (in XML files)
p7800
aVSome will cite this is as a disadvantage but not me
p7801
aVYou can then find uses of a table and/or column relatively easy by searching your XML files
p7802
aVWith SQL embedded in code (or where there is no SQL at all) it can be a lot harder to find
p7803
aVYou can also cut and paste SQL into a database tool and run it
p7804
aVI can't overstate enough how many times this has been useful to me over the years
p7805
aVPerformance/Scalability
p7806
aVHere I think ibatis wins hands down
p7807
aVIt's straight SQL and low cost
p7808
aVBy its nature JPA simply won't be able to manage the same level of latency or throughput
p7809
aVNow what JPA has going for it is that latency and throughput are only rarely problems
p7810
aVHigh performance systems however do exist and will tend to disfavour more heavyweight solutions like JPA
p7811
aVPlus with ibatis you can write a query that returns exactly the data you want with the exact columns that you need
p7812
aVFundamentally there's no way JPA can beat (or even match) that when it's returning discrete entities
p7813
aVEase of Troubleshooting
p7814
aVI think this one is a win for Ibatis too
p7815
aVLike I mentioned above, with JPA you will sometimes spend half a day getting a query or entity produce the SQL you want or diagnosing a problem where a transaction fails because the entity manager tried to persist an unmanaged object (which could be part of a batch job where you've committed a lot of work so it might be nontrivial to find)
p7816
aVBoth of them will fail if you try to use a table or column that doesn't exist, which is good
p7817
aVOther criteria
p7818
aVNow you didn't mention portability as one of your requirements (meaning moving between database vendors)
p7819
aVIt's worth noting that here JPA has the advantage
p7820
aVThe annotations are less portable than, say, Hibernate XML (eg standard JPA annotations don't have an equivalent for Hibernate's "native" ID type) but both of them are more portable than ibatis / SQL
p7821
aVAlso I've seen JPA / Hibernate used as a form of portable DDL, meaning you run a small Java program that creates the database schema from JPA configuration
p7822
aVWith ibatis you'll need a script for each supported database
p7823
aVThe downside of portability is that JPA is, in some ways, lowest common denominator, meaning the supported behaviour is largely the common supported behaviour across a wide range of database vendors

p7987
aVThese will invariably only have, say, 3-8 significant digits of accuracy
p7988
aVAs to whether to use single or double precision floating point types, this depends on your need for accuracy and how many significant digits you need
p7989
aVTypically though people just end up using doubles unless they have a good reason not to
p7990

aVGuice is another one
p8013
aVYou can even roll your own if it's undesirable to add a complete framework for this
p8014
aVBut I have problems envisioning a Java application--particularly a Web/J2EE application--that I do without using Spring
p8015
aVIt's simply too useful
p8016
aVLet's say there are 4 versions of a relevant jar
p8017
aVThe API has changed twice in that time so you have 3 different API versions
p8018
aVYou need to abstract use of that jar to an API of your own that is consistent across all these versions and then create three implementations of it: one for each different API version
p8019
aVIn Spring you create an application context, which defines all your beans and how they're injected into other beans
p8020
aVThere is no reason you can't choose or build and application context as part of a build process
p8021
aVOften properties are used for this but you could also include part of the application context this way too

p8037
aVJava 6 has been out for a year and a half or more and is mature
p8038
aVThere's no reason to not pick it over Java 5 (imho)
p8039
aVSecondly, like any software project, your goal should be to get something into production as soon as you possibly can
p8040
aVSo you need to identify a slice of your system
p8041
aVThe smaller the better, the more non-cdritical, the better
p8042

p8043
aVIt might be worse than you expected
p8044
aVIt might be much better
p8045
aVThe other thing you'll probably need to be aware of is that by the sounds of it you will have jars/libraries in your app that have since been deprecated
p8046

p8047
ag6339

aVYou will probably want to upgrade all of these to the latest version as well

VI too am a big fan of Spring MVC--particularly when used in conjunction with Spring Webflow, which is just awesome

aVNow Webflow can be used with other Web frameworks but it's most natural fit is with Spring MVC
p8119
aVIn my case I went from Struts (1) to Spring MVC
p8120
aVWe had a lot of built up infrastructure for using Struts
p8121
aVOne thing I underestimated when writing new pages in Spring MVC is how much time we would spend essentially reinventing that infrastructure

p8123

p8124

p8125
aVThe fact that that process is still going on may be a real problem
p8126
aVYou can't ignore the fact that you'll have it with something else too
p8127
aVI find Spring MVC and Webflow are best once you have some infrastructure around validations and forms logic
p8128
aVFor example, we had this process a lot on our system:
p8129
aVUser places order;
p8130
aVServer validates parameters and either rejects order (return to (1)) or accepts it;
p8131
aVThe verified order is returned to displayed to the user who confirms that they either want to place the order or cancel it;
p8132
aVIf they cancel it, display a page saying it has been cancelled;
p8133
aVIf they approve it, verify the order again;
p8134
aVIf it fails validation return to (1);
p8135
aVOtherwise place the order and display the result to the user
p8136
aVIt may sound convoluted but it came up a lot
p8137
aVWhere Spring MVC really shines is for this kind of scenario you can create a custom controller and then the actual implementation just becomes an issue of plugging in the right views and support beans
p8138
aVDon't underestimate the cost of developing and testing required infrastructure
p8139
aVThe other thing to consider is team experience: if noone else has Spring MVC experience then that's going to present some issues

VI went through some testing with this as well
p8249
aVIf you are loading a Javascript file it is faster to put it at the end BUT it does come with some important caveats
p8250
aVThe first is that doing this often made some of my visual effects noticeable
p8251
aVFor example, if I was using jQuery to format a table, the table would come up unformatted and then the code would run to reformat it
p8252
aVI didn't find this to be a good user experience and would rather the page came up complete
p8253
aVSecondly, putting it at the end made it hard to put code in your pages because often functions didn't exist yet
p8254
aVIf you have this in your page:
p8255
aVWell that won't work until the jQuery object is defined
p8256
aVIf it's defined at the end of your page the above will produce an error
p8257
aVNow you could argue that all that styling code could be put in the external file but that would be a mistake for performance reasons
p8258
aVI started off doing that on a project and then found my page took a second to run through all the Javascript that had been centralized
p8259
aVSo I created functions for the relevant behaviour and then called the appropriate ones in each page, reducing the Javascript load run time to 50-200ms
p8260
aVLastly, you can (and should) minimize the load time of Javascript by versioning your Javascript files and then using far-futures Expires headers so they're only loaded once (each time they're changed), at which point where they are in the file is largely irrelevant
p8261
aVSo all in all I found putting putting the Javascript files at the end of the file to be cumbersome and ultimately unnecessary

VThe answer to this question depends on a number of things:
p8519
aVHow backwards compatible do you need to be
p8520
aVIncluding IE6 will decrease the capacity of pure CSS; and
p8521
aVHow much of your site is fixed-width and/or fixed-height
p8522
aVThere are certain things in CSS that become hard if not impossible in variable width and/or height situations
p8523
aVSide-by-side content is a problem for CSS
p8524
aVYou can use floats for this but if the sum of widths exceeds the width of the container, the tail end floats will fall down below
p8525
aVTables are more capable in this regard as they will squeeze columns where possible to make things fit and cells will never be split onto new rows
p8526
aVVertical centering you mentioned
p8527
aVIts trivial with tables and hard or impossible (depending on compatibility and fixed or variable heights of the container and the item) in pure CSS

aVIE6 only supports the :hover pseudo element on anchors
p8530
aVJavascript is required for that browser for :hover-like behaviour

p8634

aVbecause that's relatively unlikely to occur otherwise in an HTML page (although, for completeness, you'll need to cater for the case where the user does actually want to use those character combinations

VI'e addressed this point in Database Development Mistakes Made by AppDevelopers
p8650
aVBasically, favour joins to aggregation
p8651
aVIN isn't aggregation as such but the same principle applies
p8652
aVA good optimize will make these two queries equivalent in performance:
p8653
aVand
p8654
aVas I believe Oracle and SQL Server both do but MySQL doesn't
p8655
aVThe second version is basically instantaneous
p8656
aVWith hundreds of thousands of rows I did a test on my machine and got the first version to sub-second performance by adding appropriate indexes
p8657
aVThe join version with indexes is basically instantaneous but even without indexes performs OK
p8658
aVBy the way, the above syntax I use is the one you should prefer for doing joins
p8659
aVIt's clearer than putting them in the  clause (as others have suggested) and the above can do certain things in an ANSI SQL way with left outer joins that WHERE conditions can't
p8660
aVSo I would add indexes on the following:
p8661
aVtbl_news (news_id)
p8662
aVtbl_tag_relations (news_id)
p8663
aVtbl_tag_relations (tag_id)
p8664
aVand the query will execute almost instantaneously
p8665
aVLastly, don't use * to select all the columns you want
p8666
aVName them explicitly
p8667

VIt depends on how you define "fastest"
p8674
aVAs Joel says, developer time is expensive
p8675
aVMysqldump works and handles a lot of cases you'd otherwise have to handle yourself or spend time evaluating other products to see if they handle them
p8676
aVThe pertinent questions are:
p8677
aVHow often does your production database schema change
p8678
aVNote: I'm referring to adding, removing or renaming tables, columns, views and the like ie things that will break actual code
p8679
aVHow often do you need to put production data into a development environment
p8680
aVIn my experience, not very often at all
p8681
aVI've generally found that once a month is more than sufficient
p8682
aVHow long does mysqldump take
p8683
aVIf it's less than 8 hours it can be done overnight as a cron job
p8684
aVProblem solved
p8685
aVDo you need all the data
p8686
aVAnother way to optimize this is to simply get a relevant subset of data
p8687
aVOf course this requires a custom script to be written to get a subset of entities and all relevant related entities but will yield the quickest end result
p8688
aVThe script will also need to be maintained through schema changes so this is a time-consuming approach that should be used as an absolute last resort
p8689
aVProduction samples should be large enough to include a sufficiently broad sample of data and identify any potential performance problems
p8690
aVConclusion
p8691
aVBasically, just use mysqldump until you absolutely can't

aVOn MyISAM tables it will use a full text index against those columns
p8722

p8723
aVLIKE is only efficient if you're doing it against:
p8724
aVa column (not a result of a function unless your particular database vendor supports functional indexes--Oracle, for example--and you're using them);

aVthe start of the column (ie LIKE 'blah%' as opposed to LIKE '%blah%'); and

aVa column that's indexed
p8727

aVThere's a real tendency, particularly in this realm, to simply use a framework for the sake of using one or because you feel like you should be using something
p9081
aVI discourage such practices
p9082
aVAlso frameworks I think have the most value when you've done things the hard way so you have a good understanding of what problems you have and how the framework can help you in that situation
p9083
aVFramework choice does depend on the situation
p9084
aVThat all being said, the MVC pattern with Web applications is useful so it certainly wouldn't hurt you to learn at least one
p9085
aVI'd stick to a fairly minimalist framework however
p9086
aVCodeIgniter springs to mind here
p9087
aVLastly, the other danger with frameworks is that they can be so invasive that you're no longer doing PHP, you're doing CakePHP, Symfony or whatever
p9088
aVThat's not necessarily a problem but the danger in it being so invasive is you don't get a good grounding in PHP and if you ever want to change it'll simply be too hard that you'll never be able to do it

VI think your reasoning is sound and it's the way I would go as well
p9114
aVBasically what you're talking about are bridge/adapter/facade classes
p9115
aVThey are (imho) more flexible and easier to understand than XSL templates
p9116
aVThe third reason isn't really one because XSL support involves nothing more than uncommenting a PHP extension
p9117
aVI'm also glad to see you want to do this via the DOM extensions (or equivalent library) rather than writing XML as text, which introduces all the escaping issues and whatnot you'll avoid your way
p9118
aVPersonally I also think that XSL templates are more fragile to change (by virtue of them being somewhat more cryptic to the vast majority of programmers) so if your superset format ever changes (which, let's face it, it will) you'll potentially need to change all your templates
p9119

VSome people favour the delete/insert approach because, like you say, it is simpler
p9153
aVPersonally I think the update/insert/delete approach, while more work, is more correct
p9154
aVIf you do updates you can then have an audit trail of changes to a particular item
p9155
aVWith just insert/delete it's either much harder or plain impossible to have that kind of linkage and history
p9156
aVAs for how to handle the submission of the form, for fields that can be updated (ie they're existing records), you need to be able to identify the field somehow
p9157
aVPersonally I just encode something like the primary key in the field name
p9158
aVIf you do this you must of course ensure that you don't have a security hole by validating that the ID supplied is valid and the edit allowed ie never trust the client
p9159
aVThis could take the form of:
p9160
aVand you have to process all the input parameters, decode the identifier and act accordingly
p9161
aVLastly, another problem with insert/delete is that you can't do it (or it just gets really hard) if the items you're deleting/inserting relate to other tables in the database
p9162
aVIf you have a question table and store the answers people give, normally you'll reference the question as a foreign key

aVAn important point to make here is that with Rails (typically meaning Ruby on Rails although it could be Groovy, etc) you're comparing a framework to a language (PHP)
p9484
aVThere are many PHP frameworks so a lot of the issues of speed of coding diminish if not disappear altogether if you compare Ruby on Rails to PHP + some framework or frameworks with which you're equally familiar
p9485
aVFrom experience I can tell you that non-technical users will be concerned with some or all of the following:
p9486
aVCost to develop;
p9487
aVCost to host;
p9488
aVLook and feel;
p9489
aVSite functionality;
p9490
aVAbility to find developers;
p9491
aVStability;
p9492
aVExisting functionality; and
p9493
aVRisk
p9494
aV(1) is debatable
p9495
aVRuby on Rails is probably very fast if you're doing things the Ruby way but can get really difficult if requirements force you to go off the reservation
p9496
aVInterestingly, Microsoft stacks tend to work the same way (although they usually have a bigger reservation to further extend that metaphor)
p9497
aVThis came up in 7 reasons I switched back to PHP after 2 years on Rails
p9498
aVAgree or disagree, that sort of post makes points you'll at least need to consider and/or address
p9499
aV(2) I think is a win for PHP
p9500
aVPHP shared hosting is extraordinarily cheap but there's not a lot in it
p9501
aVIf the site will get a moderate amount of traffic or there are significant security concerns you'll either end up hosting it at the site or using some form of VPS or dedicated hosting at which point the issue becomes a wash
p9502
aV(3) isn't really that different
p9503
aVRuby is slanted twoards Prototype (being integrated) and the like whereas PHP is more open to any Javascript framework (which has advantages and disadvantages) and both can do whatever in HTML and CSS
p9504
aVSame applies to (4)
p9505
aVThere's nothing you can do in one that you can't do in the other
p9506
aV(5) is a clear win for PHP
p9507
aVYou may not be hiring hundreds of developers but the fat that if you move on or are replaced that it's easy to find other people with relevant experience is important to non-technical people (and should be important to technical people too)
p9508
aV(6) is either a perceived or real win for PHP
p9509
aVBy that I mean Ruby on Rails--at least in my experience--has a reputation for being unstable and/or wasteful of resources
p9510
aVThis is exemplified by such postings as Zed Shaw's notorious Rails Is A Ghetto rant
p9511
aVIt clearly is a rant but there are some valid points there too
p9512
aV(7) is an interesting one
p9513
aVRails mandates (or rather "is") an ORM framework and like many ORM frameworks they can have real issues in dealing with "legacy" data
p9514
aVI put that in inverted commas because ORMs have the nasty habit of declaring anything not done their way as "legacy" (eg composite keys)
p9515
aVIf you have complete control over the data model on this site and there's no existing data model to support then this issue is probably a win for Rails but the more constraints you have the more this will be a win for PHP's lightweight (typically raw SQL) approach

VI'm not from the US so the W-2 and 1099 part is beyond me but I'll address the rest as those issues are pretty universal
p9523
aVGenerally speaking, a rule of thumb is that if you earn $100k per year you should be charging $100/hour or pretty close to it
p9524
aVThis is to cover some or all of:
p9525
aVNo personal/sick leave;
p9526
aVNo paid annual leave;
p9527
aVNo bonuses;
p9528
aVNo training;
p9529
aVInsurances (health, public liability, professional indemnity, etc);
p9530
aVIf you are not contracted to a certain number of hours per week, there is variability in income;
p9531
aVThe employer can get rid you much more easily than a full-time employee
p9532
aVNow this is my experience in Australia and Europe where you actually have quite significant public health care
p9533
aVI might imagine that since you don't in the US, the health insurance costs might drive this even higher so perhaps you should be asking for $120+/hour
p9534
aVNote: if you're not paying things like professional indemnity insurance or you don't have some sort of legal protection (like operating through a limited liability company) you are playing with fire and I strongly urge you to seek professional advice on setting up a structure and/or obtaining relevant insurances to adequately protect you, your assets and your family if you have one
p9535
aVOf course you have to balance this all out against the current market conditions, which aren't all that great (but vary from locale to locale)
p9536
aVI like the hourly rate scenario because it's "fair"
p9537
aVBy that I mean if you work 80 hours one week to get something out then you get paid for it
p9538
aVYou just get paid for what you do and that's it
p9539
aVIt's simple
p9540
aVNow employers often don't like it because they can't necessarily predict (and thus budget) the costs
p9541
aVThe next step is to get paid a daily rate
p9542
aVI typically try and resist this but I will go for it in certain situations
p9543
aVIf so, you need to define exactly what a day is
p9544
aVIf you work at all do you get paid for a half day
p9545
aVA full day
p9546
aVDo you need to work a certain number of hours to get paid for the day
p9547
aVDo you only ever get paid for a full day no matter how many hours you work in that day
p9548
aVCan you get paid for more than 5 days a week
p9549
aVGenerally for this sort of situation I'll mutliply my hourly rate by 9 basing it on an 8 hour day
p9550
aVYou're taking on some of the risk so you need to get paid for that
p9551
aVBeyond that you can go to weekly and then monthly
p9552
aVThey too have the issue of having to define what constitutes a week or month
p9553
aVThere are on average 20 or 21 working days a month so multiply your daily rate by 21-25 to get a monthly rate
p9554
aVAs for a negotiation strategy, pretty much use the points listed above
p9555
aVIf $120/hour sounds like a lot (to them) point out all the costs involved, which are also costs they're saving
p9556
aVUse your proven track record to your advantage because I can guarantee you that there are few things more catastrophic to a company than incompetent software development

p9572
aVYou could take an existing theme and modify it
p9573
aVThing is there are lot of image files and the like you'd need to change
p9574
aVAlso, a lot of those files have a name corresponding to the colour or other relevant variable
p9575
aVThat's actually extremely smart because it means you can put a far future Expires header on the CSS and images and if you change theme it'll still update correctly
p9576
aVSo you could leave the filenames the same but then you'd have a problem if you used a far futures Expires header (which you should) plus it'd be confusing to someone else who came along and saw it

p9836
aVWell, anything service-oriented at any rate
p9837
aVWhile Swing sometimes acts like this via SwingWorkers and the like, Swing is fundamentally synchronous via the EDT (event dispatching thread)
p9838
aVIt can take a bit of getting used to;
p9839
aVYou're in for a world of hurt known as CSS and cross-browser compatibility
p9840
aVWhile GWT does mask many of the differences between browsers, it certainly doesn't mask them all and you can spend hours looking for the source of a line of pixels in GWT just as you can in a normal Web Site;

p9848
aV6;
p9849
aVThe compile-time on GWT is just horrific;
p9850
aVIf you're just making client changes (ie you're not changing any service interfaces), you don't need to rebuild to see those changes
p9851
aVJust refresh in the hosted browser;
p9852
aVFor changes to serverside code that doesn't change the interfaces, make sure you have an Ant or Maven task to rebuild and redeploy your classes without doing a GWT rebuild;
p9853
aVYou can point the hosted browser at something other than the hosted server and debug using it; and
p9854
aVMake sure your machine has lots of RAM

p10258
aVSo I can't tell you exactly how to validate but I can tell you what to validate
p10259
aVThe first thing is that a CC number with spaces should not be rejected
p10260
aVMost people will find:
p10261
aVmuch easier to read than:
p10262
aVwhich is really important if the user misses or mistypes a digit and needs to find why his or her credit card number failed validation
p10263
aVThe replaceAll() at the top of this post covers this situation
p10264
aVThe second thing is that you display the credit card number (even when some of the digits are replaced with X for security reasons) in the correct way
p10265
aVI suggest you read through Anatomy of Credit Card Numbers
p10266
aVThat page gives you the rules for the number of digits and the valid prefixes
p10267
aVA robust Web application will implement these so you can tell if a credit card number is invalid before you try and use it
p10268
aVIt can take up to 30 seconds (or possibly more) to submit credit card details to a payment gateway so you shouldn't do it until you are sure as you can be that the payment will be accepted
p10269
aVTo do otherwise is to provide a really bad user experience
p10270
aVThere is every chance the user will give up if it fails 1-2 times rather than wait
p10271
aVAs for displaying them, that depends on the # of digits:
p10272
aV16: 4 groups of 4 separated by a space;
p10273
aV15: like an American Express card ie 4-6-5 with a space between each group;
p10274
aV14: like a Diners Club card ie 4-6-4 with a space between each group;
p10275
aV13: Never seen 13 but 4-5-4 or 4-4-5 or 5-4-4 (or possibly 3-3-3-4) springs to mind
p10276
aVThe credit card number should be verified according to the checksum algorithm mentioned in the page before submitting for processing as part of a standard validation routine
p10277
aVThat page has a Java implementation of that routine
p10278
aVEvery website that accepts credit card payment should be doing all of the above as an absolute minimum or you're simply throwing away business as a percentage of your users get frustrated
p10279
aVSo the short version is two simple rules:
p10280
aVBe as forgiving as possible with user input; and
p10281
aVDo absolutely everything possible to validate credit card details prior to submission

aVAs for programming either #1 or #2, option #2 is easier to program but #1 isn't much harder and both are probably about as secure as each other
p10580
aVWhichever option you choose, you can also consider making it more secure by including requests for personal information (that you obtain during registration) as part of the forgotten password process
p10581
aVI've programmed systems where you have a username and to get a new password you have to enter both your username and your email address
p10582
aVYou can get sent a reminder of your username but the main point is that someone probably won't be able to guess your username and your email but if you do it just on email, there's less secure

p10588

aV100) you might use a byte (-128 to 127 signed or 0 to 255 unsigned) as it was adequately large for the job and thus seen as less "wasteful"
p10657
aVThese days however such measures are unnecessary
p10658
aVMemory isn't typically that much of a premium and if it were you'd probably be defeated by modern computers aligning things on 32 bit word boundaries (if not 64) anyway
p10659
aVUnless you're storing arrays of thousands of these things then these kinds of micro-optimizations are (now) an irrelevant distraction
p10660
aVFrankly I can't remember the last time I didn't use a byte for something other than raw data and I can't think of the last time I used a short for, well, anything

aVThe one thing to watch is memory fragmentation from excessive unnedded debug calls so, with Log4J (and most other Java logging frameworks), you end up with something like this:
p10668
aVbecause constructing that log message (that you probably aren't using) could be expensive, especially if done thousands or millions of times
p10669
aVYour INFO level logging shouldn't be too "chatty" (and from what you say, it sounds like it isn't)

p10672
aVDebug/fine level logging is more used for when you actually have a problem you're trying to diagnose
p10673
aVDebug/fine logging is typically only turned on when needed
p10674
aVInfo is typically on all the time
p10675
aVIf someone doesn't want specific INFO messages from your classes, they are of course free to change your log4j configuration to not get them

aVLog4j is beautifully straightforward in this department (as opposed to Java 1
p10677
aV4 logging)
p10678
aVAs for your HTTP thing, I've generally not found that to be an issue with Java logging because typically a single class is responsible for what you're interested in so you only need to put it in one place

p10703
aVThat way you can dynamically generate the XML at runtime
p10704
aVOr maybe something like Dynamic JPA would interest you
p10705
aVI think it's necessary to further clarify the issues with this problem
p10706
aVThe first question is: are the set of tables where an entity can be stored known
p10707
aVBy this I mean you aren't dynamically creating tables at runtime and wanting to associate entities with them
p10708
aVThis scenario calls for, say, three tables to be known at compile-time
p10709
aVIf that is the case you can possibly use JPA inheritance
p10710
aVThe OpenJPA documentation details the table per class inheritance strategy
p10711
aVThe advantage of this method is that it is pure JPA
p10712
aVIt comes with limitations however, being that the tables have to be known and you can't easily change which table a given object is stored in (if that's a requirement for you), just like objects in OO systems don't generally change class or type
p10713
aVIf you want this to be truly dynamic and to move entities between tables (essentially) then I'm not sure JPA is the right tool for you
p10714
aVAn awful lot of magic goes into making JPA work including load-time weaving (instrumentation) and usually one or more levels of caching
p10715
aVWhat's more the entity manager needs to record changes and handle updates of managed objects
p10716
aVThere is no easy facility that I know of to instruct the entity manager that a given entity should be stored in one table or another
p10717
aVSuch a move operation would implicitly require a delete from one table and insertion into another
p10718
aVIf there are child entities this gets more difficult
p10719
aVNot impossible mind you but it's such an unusual corner case I'm not sure anyone would ever bother
p10720
aVA lower-level SQL/JDBC framework such as Ibatis may be a better bet as it will give you the control that you want
p10721
aVI've also given thought to dynamically changing or assigning at annotations at runtime
p10722
aVWhile I'm not yet sure if that's even possible, even if it is I'm not sure it'd necessarily help
p10723
aVI can't imagine an entity manager or the caching not getting hopelessly confused by that kind of thing happening
p10724
aVThe other possibility I thought of was dynamically creating subclasses at runtime (as anonymous subclasses) but that still has the annotation problem and again I'm not sure how you add that to an existing persistence unit
p10725
aVIt might help if you provided some more detail on what you're doing and why
p10726
aVWhatever it is though, I'm leaning towards thinking you need to rethink what you're doing or how you're doing it or you need to pick a different persistence technology

VThis is a hard thing to do automatically for several reasons:
p10912

p10913
aVBasically you should write HTML like it was 1999, so HTML 3
p10914
aV2/4
p10915
aV0, no CSS;
p10916
aVYou have a choice of including images as external links or embed them directly in the email
p10917
aVExternal links take up less space but many mailers block them as they're used by spammers to tag live addresses (by making each image URL they send unique and thus they can figure out which email was opened)
p10918
aVEmbedded images use a slightly different reference format;
p10919
aVCSS support should basically be treated as nonexistant
p10920
aVAll CSS must be internal;
p10921
aVIt is best practice, when sending HTML email, to also send a plain-text version for clients that either don't have HTML support or the user has disabled it (yes this does happen)
p10922
aVAnd there is no good way of turning a complex HTML page into a plain text equivalent
p10923
aVIt basically has to be done by hand; and
p10924
aVEmail content is different to Webpage content
p10925
aVWebpages typically have search boxes, menus, sidebars, headers, footers and so on
p10926
aVThese are all things you're not interested in emailing
p10927
aVYou're only interested in the content of the page
p10928
aVSo blogs work quite well for this because the content of a blog post can easily be extracted
p10929
aVIt's harder with arbitrary pages
p10930
aVSo there are various ways you could do this like using cURL to get the Webpage, using output buffering to capture the page by using require/include, etc but all these methods suffer from one or more of the above problems

VThe main benefit of an external CSS file is that:
p10956
aVIt can be used on multiple pages; and
p10957
aVIt can be cached so it doesn't need to be loaded on every page
p10958
aVSo, if there is potential for reuse of the dynamically generated CSS between pages or on multiple views of the same page then an external file could add value
p10959
aVThere are several common patterns for dynamically generated CSS
p10960
ag2257
aVGenerating a subset for a page
p10961
aVI've seen this occasionally
p10962
aVA developer decides to limit the amount of CSS per page by only sending what's necessary
p10963
aVI don't imagine this is the case for you but I'm mentioning it for completeness
p10964
aVThis is a misguided effort at optimization
p10965
aVIt's cheaper to send the whole lot and just cache it effectively
p10966
ag4699
aVUser-selected theme
p10967
aVIf the user selects a particular look for your site, that's what I'm talking about
p10968
aVThis implies they might select a whole package of CSS and there might be a limited set to choose from
p10969
aVUsually this will be done by having one or more base CSS files and then oen or more theme CSS files
p10970
aVThe best solution here is to send the right combination of external CSS files by dynamically generating the page header with the right  elements and then caching those files effectively
p10971
ag6330
aVUser-rolled theme
p10972
aVThis goes beyond (2) to where the user can select, say, colours, fonts and sizes to the point where you can't package those choices into a single theme bundle but you have to generate a set of CSS for that user
p10973
aVIn this case you will probably still have some common CSS
p10974
aVSend that as an external CSS files (again, caching them effectively)
p10975
aVThe dynamic content may be best on the page or you may still be able to make use of external files because there is no reason a  can't point to a script instead of a static file
p10976
aVFor example:
p10977
aVwhere the query string is generated dynamically by your header from who is logged in
p10978
aVThat script will look up the user preferences and generate a dynamic CSS file
p10979
aVThis can be cached effectively whereas putting it directly in the HTML file can't be (unless the whole HTML file can be cached effectively)
p10980
ag6339
aVRules-based CSS generation
p10981
aVI've written a reporting system before that took a lot of rules specified by either the user or a report writer and a custom report and generated a complete HTML page (based on the tables and/or charts they requested in the custom report definition) and styled them according to the rules
p10982
aVThis truly was dynamic CSS
p10983
aVThing is, there is potential for caching here too
p10984
aVThe HTML page generates a dynamic link like this:
p10985
aVwhere 'annual-sales' is the report ID and 0001 is like a version
p10986
aVWhen the rules change you create a new version and each version for each report can be cached effectively
p10987
aVConclusion
p10988
aVSo I can't say definitively whether external CSS files are appropriate or not to you but having seen and developed for each of the scenarios above I have a hard time believing that you can't get some form of caching out of your CSS at which point it should be external
p10989
aVI've written about the issue of effective CSS in Supercharging CSS in PHP but the principles and techniques apply in any language, not just PHP

VAny integer type of sufficient size to store anticipated data ranges
p11058
aVGenerally 32 bit ints are viewed as too small (rightly or wrongly) for tables with a lot of rows or changes
p11059
aVA 64 bit int is plenty
p11060
aVMany databases won't have or won't use that integer type but will use a NUMBER type with specified scale and precision
p11061
aV10-15 digits is a fairly common size
p11062
aVThe reason for choosing integer types is twofold:
p11063
aVSize; and
p11064
aVSpeed
p11065
aVThe size of an integer is:
p11066
aV32 bit: 4 bytes;
p11067
aV64 bit: 8 bytes;
p11068
aVBinary coded decimal: two digits per byte plus as much as a byte for sign, scale and/or precision
p11069
aVCompare that to a GUID, which is 128 bits or a normal string, which is at least one byte per character (more in certain character encodings) plus an overhead that might be as little as one byte (terminating null) or could be much more in some cases
p11070
aVSorting integers is trivial and, assuming they are unique and the range is sufficiently small, can actually be done in O(n) time, compared to, at best, O(n log n)
p11071
aValso, just as importantly, most databases can generate unique IDs by means of auto-increment columns and/or sequences
p11072
aVGuaranteeing uniqueness in an application is otherwise actually quite hard and tends to result in bloated keys
p11073
aVPlus auto-generated integer keys are typically either loosely or absolutely ordered  (depending on database and configuration), which is a useful quality
p11074
aVRandomly generated GUIDs are basically unordered, which is far less useful

aVThings that I can think of:
p11127
aVCapitals tends to signify agitation, annoyance or frustration and is certainly an emotional response but then again some newbies do that because they don't realize the significance so you couldn't assume that without looking at what else they've written (to make sure its not all in caps);
p11128
aVCapitals are really just one form of emphasis
p11129
aVOthers are use of certain aggressive colours (eg red) or use of bold or larger fonts;
p11130
aVSome people make more spelling and grammar mistakes and typos when they're highly emotional;
p11131
aVScanning for emoticons could give you a very clear picture of what the user is feeling but again something like :) could be interpreted as happy, "I told you so" or even have a sarcastic meaning;
p11132
aVUse of expletives tends to have a clear meaning but again its not clearcut
p11133
aVColloquial speech by many people will routinely contain certain four letter words
p11134
aVFor some other people, they might not even say "hell", saying "heck" instead so any expletive (even "sucks") is significant;
p11135
aVGroups of punctuation marks (like @#$@$@) tend to be replaced for expletives in a context when expletives aren't necessarily appropriate, so thats less likely to be colloquial;
p11136
aVExclamation marks can indicate surprise, shock or exasperation
p11137
aVYou might want to look at Advances in written text analysis or even Determining Mood for a Blog by Combining Multiple Sources of Evidence

p11233

p11235

aVLets say someone asks you to move the second button to the far right

aVThis is how you do it:

aVIf you don't do this, the second (floated) button will appear below the other

VIt will often be argued that for speed purposes you should put script tags right at the end of the document (before the close body tag)
p11906
aVWhile this will result in the fastest page load, it has some serious downsides
p11907
aVFirstly, a common idiom with Webpage development is to have a header file, a footer file and your content in the middle
p11908
aVTo keep unnecessary Javascript to a minimum, you'll often want to put code snippets in individual pages
p11909
aVIf you include jquery, for example, at the end of the document, your jquery code snippets (like document ready stuff) must happen after that
p11910
aVThat can be awkward from a development point of view
p11911
aVSecondly, in my experience, because the page load is faster, you can end up noticing certain effects being applied because the page has already loaded by the time they are applied
p11912
aVFor example if you put a table in a document and right before the body close tag put:
p11913
aVwith appropriate styling, that effect being applied will often be visible
p11914
aVPersonally I think that makes for a bad user experience potentially
p11915
aVI think often you're better off having the page load slightly slower (by putting scripts at the top) if you don't get disconcerting visual effects
p11916
aVI generally advocate effective caching strategies so you only have to download Javascript files when they change, as in Supercharging Javascript in PHP (but the principles apply to any language, not just PHP) and still putting scripts at the top

VI have three pieces of advice:
p11969
aVUse a reset CSS (there are several of these around);
p11970

p11971
aVI usually use HTML 4
p11972
aV01 transitional for this but if you comply with strict, even better;
p11973
aVQualify your styles with the element name
p11974
aVFor example:
p11975
aVThe more specific a style is, the greater its importance in CSS for determining which one applies
p11976
aVYou can see if thats the issue by testing it with :
p11977
aVIf that fixes the issue then you've got other CSS that is taking precedence
p11978
aVI suspect this is the issue as  selectors have a higher precedence than  selectors, which is the behaviour you're seeing
p11979

aVYou can get vertical alignment to the bottom using relative+absolute positioning like this:

aVAlso, depending on whether all the elements need to be absolutely positioned or not, you may need to start doing things like specifying the height of the containing element explicitly, which is usually undesirable
p12037

p12038
aVThe problem is that the baselines of the different-sized fonts will not match up and I don't know of a "pure" CSS way of doing this

aVWith tables however the solution is trivial:
p12040
aVTry it and you'll see it works perfectly

VIn PHP pretty much everything is instantiated on every page hit

aVFor user-specific data you can put it in a cookie (not recommended for security reasons);
p12051
aVPut user-specific data in the session, which basically means writing it to file and loading it from file on every hit;

aVStoring it in some form of persistent storage, such as a file or database table;
p12053
aVStore it in a cache of some kind (eg memcached)

VCSS widths in general can be a little confusing
p12333
aVAbsolute widths are easy
p12334
aVRelative widths can lead to some interesting behaviour
p12335
aVBasically, percentage widths are relative to the containing element
p12336
aVIf the parent element has an absolute width then it's easy to work out
p12337
aVOften it doesn't though so you can get into complicated calculations of how a browser calculates how much space it needs
p12338
aVIf all its children are percentage width then it'll often end up having less width than the designer usually intends
p12339
aVSo when you see , that basically means move this element outside its parent to the left the complete width of the parent
p12340
aVOne consequence of negative margins (in particular) is that the space they move into often won't cater for them being there and you have to take this into account when planning layout

p12394
aVBasically:
p12395
aVYou then just have to do two things:
p12396
aVCreate a  for all your existing tuples of 5; and
p12397
aVCreate an algorithm to create all the possible sets of 5

aVIntel's Core 2 Duo/Quad system uses a shared bus
p12674
aVThink of this like Ethernet or cable internet where there is only so much bandwidth to go round and every new participant just takes another share from the whole
p12675
aVCore i7 and newer Xeons use QuickPath, which is pretty similar to HyperTransport
p12676
aVMore cores will occupy less space, use less space and less power and cost less (unless you're using really low powered CPUs) both in per-core terms and the cost of other hardware (eg motherboards)
p12677
aVGenerally speaking one CPU will the the cheapest (both in terms of hardware AND software)
p12678
aVCommodity hardware can be used for this
p12679
aVOnce you go to the second socket you tend to have to use different chipsets, more expensive motherboards and often more expensive RAM (eg ECC fully buffered RAM) so you take a massive cost hit going from one CPU to two
p12680
aVIt's one reason so many large sites (including Flickr, Google and others) use thousands of commodity servers (although Google's servers are somewhat customized to include things like a 9V battery but the principle is the same)
p12681
aVYour edits don't really change much
p12682
aV"Performance" is a highly subjective concept
p12683
aVPerformance at what
p12684
aVBear in mind though that if your application isn't sufficiently multithreaded (or multiprocess) to take advantage of extra cores then you can actually decrease performance by adding more cores
p12685
aVI/O bound applications probably won't prefer one over the other
p12686
aVThey are, after all, bound by I/O not CPU
p12687
aVFor compute-based applications well it depends on the nature of the computation
p12688
aVIf you're doing lots of floating point you may benefit far more by using a GPU to offload calculations (eg using Nvidia CUDA)
p12689
aVYou can get a huge performance benefit from this
p12690
aVTake a look at the GPU client for Folding@Home for an example of this
p12691
aVIn short, your question doesn't lend itself to a specific answer because the subject is complicated and there's just not enough information
p12692

VI think you're confused
p13500
aVYou're saying O(n log(n)) which is in fact worse than O(n)
p13501
aVDo you perhaps mean O(log n)
p13502
aVIf so, the answer is no
p13503
aVYou can't invert a linked list in O(log n)
p13504
aVO(n) is trivial (and the obvious solution)
p13505
aVO(n log(n)) doesn't make a lot of sense
p13506
aVEdit: Ok, so you do mean O(n log(n))
p13507
aVThen the answer is yes
p13508
aVHow
p13509
aVEasy
p13510
aVYou sort the list:
p13511
aVCount the length of the list
p13512
aVCost: O(n);
p13513
aVCreate an array of that same size;
p13514
aVCopy the elements of the linked list into the array in random order, putting the original order as part of the element
p13515
aVFor example: [A,B,C] -> [(B,2),(C,3),(A,1)]
p13516
aVCost: O(n);
p13517
aVSort the array using an efficient sort (eg quick sort) in inverted original order eg [(C,3),(B,2),(A,1)]
p13518
aVCost: O(n log(n));
p13519
aVCreate a linked list from the reversed array
p13520
aVCost: O(n)
p13521
aVTotal Cost: O(n log(n))
p13522
aVDespite all the intermediate steps, the sort is the most expensive operation
p13523
aVThe O(n) other steps are constant (meaning the number of steps is not a factor of n) so the total cost is O(n log(n))
p13524
aVEdit 2: I originally didn't put the list items in random order but realized that you could argue that an efficient sort on an already sorted list was less than O(n log(n)) even if you were reversing it
p13525
aVNow I'm not completely convinced that that's the case but the above revision removes that potential criticism
p13526

VYou basically have three approaches to this problem (one of which I'll eliminate immediately):
p13918
aVOne table per class (this is the one I'll eliminate);
p13919
aVA record type with optional columns; and
p13920
aVA record type with a child table depending on type that you join to
p13921
aVFor simplicity I generally recommend (2)
p13922
aVSo once you have your table:
p13923
aVwhere type can be 'AGENT' or 'LEAD' (for example)
p13924
aVAlternatively you can use one character type codes
p13925
aVYou can then start to fill in the blanks with the object model:
p13926
aVYou have a User parent class;
p13927
aVYou have two child classes: Lead and Agent;
p13928
aVThose children have a fixed type
p13929
aVand it should fall into place quite easily
p13930
aVAs for how to load in one statement, I would use some kind of factory
p13931
aVAssuming these barebones classes:
p13932
aVa factory could look like this:
p13933
aVAlternatively, you could have the factory method be a static method on, say, the User class and/or use a lookup table for the types to classes
p13934
aVPerhaps polluting the classes with the query result resource like that is a questionable design in the strictest OO sense, but it's simple and it works

VI would interpret it another way
p13984
aVIt's not that threads are evil, it's that side-effects are evil in a multithreaded context (which is a lot less catchy to say)
p13985
aVA side effect in this context is something that affects state shared by more than one thread, be it global or just shared
p13986
aVI recently wrote a review of Spring Batch and one of the code snippets used is:
p13987
aVNow there are at least three serious threading issues in less than 10 lines of code here
p13988
aVAn example of a side effect in this context would be updating the currentId static variable
p13989
aVFunctional programming (Haskell, Scheme, Ocaml, Lisp, others) tend to espouse "pure" functions
p13990
aVA pure function is one with no side effects
p13991
aVMany imperative languages (eg Java, C#) also encourage the use of immutable objects (an immutable object is one whose state cannot change once created)
p13992
aVThe reason for (or at least the effect of) both of these things is largely the same: they make multithreaded code much easier
p13993
aVA pure function by definition is threadsafe
p13994
aVAn immutable object by definition is threadsafe
p13995
aVThe advantage processes have is that there is less shared state (generally)
p13996
aVIn traditional UNIX C programming, doing a fork() to create a new process would result in shared process state and this was used as a means of IPC (inter-process communication) but generally that state is replaced (with exec()) with something else
p13997
aVBut threads are much cheaper to create and destroy and they take less system resources (in fact, the operating itself may have no concept of threads yet you can still create multithreaded programs)

VOne thing you should know about spammers is they always go for the low-hanging fruit
p14302
aVSame with hackers
p14303
aVBy this I mean they'll pick the easiest to hit targets that affect the most users
p14304
aVThis is why PHP and Windows vulnerabilities are often exploited: they affect so many users that if you find such a weakness/exploit your target "market" is huge
p14305
aVIt's also a big part of the reason why Linux and Mac OSs remain relatively unscathed by viruses for example: the target market is much smaller than Windows
p14306
aVNow I'm not equating the security and robustness of Windows with Mac/Linux but even though the security model of the latter two is much better the number of attacks against the former is still disproportionate with the deficiencies it has
p14307
aVI say this because one of the best ways to avoid these kinds of problems is not to use popular softare
p14308
aVphpBB for example has had lots of attacks made against it just because it's so popular
p14309
aVSo by doing your own chat/forum system you're at a disadvantage because you have a system that doesn't have the field-testing something popular does but you also have an advantage in that it isn't worth most spammer's time to exploit it
p14310
aVSo what you need to watch out for is what can automated systems do against you
p14311
aVContact forms on Websites tend to have recognizable markers (like name, email and comment fields)
p14312

p14314
aVUsing a honeypot (CSS/JS hidden fields as described elsewhere);
p14315

p15004

p15012
aVBoth mutable and immutable classes can either have public constructors or private constructors with static factory methods

aV2 Widening Primitive Conversion
p15146
aVThe following 19 specific conversions
p15147
aVon primitive types are called the
p15148
aVwidening primitive conversions:
p15149
aVbyte to short, int, long, float, or double
p15150
aVshort to int, long, float, or double
p15151
aVchar to int, long, float, or double
p15152
aVint to long, float, or double
p15153
aVlong to float or double
p15154
aVfloat to double
p15155
aVWidening primitive conversions do not lose information about the overall magnitude of a numeric value
p15156
aVConversion of an int or a long value to float, or of a long value to double, may result in loss of precision-that is, the result may lose some of the least significant bits of the value
p15157
aVIn this case, the resulting floating-point value will be a correctly rounded version of the integer value
p15158
aVTo put it another way, the JLS distinguishes between a loss of magnitude and a loss of precision
p15159
aVto  for example is a (potential) loss of magnitude because you can't store 500 in a
p15160
aVto  is a potential loss of precision but not magnitude because the value range for floats is larger than that for longs
p15161
aVSo the rule is:
p15162
aVLoss of magnitude: explicit cast required;
p15163
aVLoss of precision: no cast required
p15164

VThere are several sides to this debate (and it is a debate)
p15356
aVFirstly, there is a pervasive view in Java software development circles that software needs to be highly layered
p15357
aVThis often means pulling out domain objects and translating them to presentation objects
p15358
aVIt can go even further and have service objects and others in between
p15359
aVThis often ends up being a whole lot of boilerplate property copying for questionable benefit
p15360
aVOne question to ask yourself is this: are the objects coming out of Ibatis fit for presentation
p15361
aVOr are they generic in the sense that you, for example, have one class per table
p15362
aVA lightweight Java application is well within it's rights to choose an approach whereby the Ibatis will run queries that will return the exact information the view layer needs and then pass it all the way up (which won't be far)
p15363
aVNow this has scalability issues on large applications
p15364
aVYou could end up with hundreds or even thousands of these things so in those situations you might need a different approach

p15368

p15468

p15469
aVPages call the functions they need from those external files
p15470
aVIf your site is one page then put it inline
p15471
aVIf your site is 20 pages and they all use a little bit of Javascript, put it all in one files, include it on every page and call the functions with inlien Javascript as necessary in each file
p15472

p15473
aVSure it's PHP-specific but the principles are universal
p15474
aVBasically every extra HTTP request is a problem
p15475
aVSo if you have 20 pages each with a different Javascript file then that's a problem, even if those files are small
p15476
aVIt's better to combine all that Javascript in one file, download it just once (with effective caching) and just use what you need

aVTo give you an example
p15478
aVExternal JS file contains:
p15479
aVOne of your Web pages contains:

VThere are two types of UI components in Java: heavyweight and lightweight
p15517
aVA heavyweight component is a wrapper for something that exists in the operating system
p15518
aVWindows as an operating system has methods to create windows, dialog boxes, etc
p15519
aVA lightweight component is created entirely within the application using 2D drawing APIs and the like
p15520
aVThe operating system knows nothing about it
p15521
aVThe two "official" Java GUI APIs are Swing and AWT
p15522
aVAWT is usually used by applets (early ones anyway)
p15523
aVIt consists of heavyweight components
p15524
aVSwing is built on top of AWT but is a far more extensive API for designing usually desktop applications
p15525
aVMost Swing components are lightweight
p15526
aVSo a Java desktop application may consist of one or more heavyweight components, probably with some lightweight components thrown in
p15527
aVOr it might be all lightweight components if the 2D drawing APIs are sufficient to "fake" Windows without a heavyweight component
p15528
aVThe frame you see around a Java application might be drawn their with a library like Java2D (either directly or via components that use that or a similar API) or it might be created by Windows with configuration from the application, probably affected by the operating system's theme and display settings

p15557
aVPOST+REDIRECT+GET works like this:
p15558
aVForm submissions use the POST method;
p15559
aVWhen the JSP or (hopefully) servlet receives the POST, it does whatever it needs to do (saves or updates data or whatever);
p15560
aVThe servlet or JSP then uses a Location: HTTP header to redirect the user to what's probably that same URL

VI'd strongly advise you do two things:

aVSee a lawyer
p15688
aVFigure out what contract you made; and
p15689
aVSit down and talk to the guy
p15690
aVFigure out what he wants out of exclusive ownership
p15691
aVYour goal should be to find a solution that makes you both happy
p15692
aVI will say that with bespoke software development, you have a few common models:
p15693
aVClient contract developer to write something where the client assumes all the risk but owns the IP
p15694
aVThe developer will get paid either fixed price or T&M; (time and materials);
p15695
aVDeveloper retains IP
p15696
aVThis should lower the cost to the client as the assumption is the developer can sell the software elsewhere to recover costs;
p15697
aVDeveloper creates something on his own and then sees whether he can sell it
p15698
aVThis is generally only done when you anticipate being able to sell a lot of software
p15699
aVHopefully this will be cheaper again to the client even though the developer has assumed far more risk
p15700
aVTo put it another way:
p15701
aVThe software is worth something
p15702
aVBy definition, ownership is worth something;
p15703
aVRisk is the other big factor
p15704
aVWho is assuming the risk in this relationship
p15705
aVIf you're getting paid regardless, the client is;
p15706
aVWhat potential market is there for this software
p15707
aVThe bigger the market, the more the software is worth;
p15708
aVThe more you get paid upfront, the less risk you are assuming
p15709
aVI've read about people who will develop software jointly with a client and assume joint risk, meaning the developer gets paid nothing but earns 50% of the profit
p15710
aVOthers balance this out by taking less profit but get paid a certain amount upfront

aVFrom the PHP manual:
p16353
aVConverting to boolean
p16354
aVTo explicitly convert a value to
p16355
aVboolean, use the (bool) or (boolean)
p16356
aVcasts
p16357
aVHowever, in most cases the cast
p16358
aVis unncecessary, since a value will be
p16359
aVautomatically converted if an
p16360
aVoperator, function or control
p16361
aVstructure requires a boolean argument
p16362
aVSee also Type Juggling
p16363
aVWhen converting to boolean, the
p16364
aVfollowing values are considered FALSE:
p16365
aVthe boolean FALSE itself
p16366
aVthe integer 0 (zero)
p16367
aVthe float 0

VAn "I" prefix isn't really the Java way

aVInterface: Builder
p16385

p16387
aVI think that agrees fairly well with Java standards (Map, AbstractMap, HashMap respectively)
p16388
aVAs for replacing interfaces with abstract classes, that requires a refactor
p16389
aVI think it's a better idea to use interfaces for all method returns, data member types, local variable types and parameters

aVAbstract classes are (or should be) an implementation detail
p16391

p16438
aVIn German for example, working out the plural form is really complicated (eg Land -> Länder)
p16439
aVI think there are roughly 20-30 exceptions and the rest follow a fairly simple ruleset:
p16440
aV-y -> -ies (family -> families)
p16441
aV-us -> -i (cactus -> cacti)
p16442
aV-s -> -ses (loss -> losses)

aVotherwise add -s
p16444
aVThat being said, plural to singular form becomes that much harder because the reverse cases have ambiguities
p16445
aVFor example:
p16446
aVpies: is it py or pie
p16447
aVski: is it singular or plural for 'skus'

VThe first issue you should consider is this: stop thinking about the efficiency of retrieving the information
p16720
aVfirst and foremost, figure out how to effectively and correctly model the data and then (and only then) figure out how to do it efficiently
p16721
aVSo it depends on the nature of the config data you're storing
p16722
aVIf separate (name,value) pairs are basically unrelated then store it as one per row

aVYou could store this data as three rows:
p16732

p16789
aVThe first is fine-grained
p16790
aVThe second is coarse-grained
p16791
aVThe whole point of finding an authorization scheme is to define one that is as fine or coarse grained as you need to balance flexibility and administration/development
p16792
aVTwo common schemes that may be of interest to you:
p16793
aVGive each user a type in the database
p16794
aVWhen they log in put that type (eg User, Admin, Moderator) in the session and check that on each relevant page;
p16795
aVGive each user one or more roles (so someone could, say, be both an Admin and a Moderator or just one of them or neither)
p16796
aVThis requires a separate table (users and userroles) and putting probably an array in the session to indicate roles but is more flexible than (1)
p16797
aVRole-based authorization is very common
p16798
aVThere are many, many variations upon these two and just as many alternatives
p16799
aVVarious schemes can be combined
p16800
aVThis is why generic authorization libraries for me fall short because they have contrary needs of being broad enough to cover a large number of use cases and being coarse-grained enough to be useful for the individual user

VThe only possible answer to that is: yes, if there is a performance gain that is relevant and useful
p17139
aVThe question should I guess really be: Can you get a meaningful performance gain by using assembly language in a C/C++ program
p17140
aVThe answer is yes
p17141
aVThe cases where you get a meaningful increase in performance have probably diminished over the last 10-20 years as libraries and compilers have improved but for an architecture like x86 in particular hand optimization in certain applications (particularly graphics related) this can be done
p17142
aVBut like anything don't optimize until you need to
p17143
aVI would argue that algorithm optimization and writing highly efficient C (in particular) will create far more of a performance gain for less time spent than rewriting in assembly language in the vast majority of cases

VEnums in Java 5+ are basically classes that have a predefined set of instances
p17434
aVThey are intended as a replacement for, say, a collection of integer constants
p17435
aVThey are preferably to constants as they can enforce type safety
p17436
aVSo instead of:
p17437
aVyou have:
p17438
aVThe advantages are:
p17439
aVType safety
p17440
aVYou can declare a function argument, return type, class member or local variable to be a particular Enum type and the compiler will enforce type safety;
p17441
aVEnums are basically classes
p17442
aVThey can implement interfaces, have behaviour and so on
p17443
aVThe type safety is an issue because in the first example, these are valid statements:
p17444
aVor you can pass in 11 to a function expecting a suit
p17445
aVYou can't do that with a typesafe enum
p17446
aVYou can use a class for Suit to provide type safety and this was the solution before Java 5
p17447
aVJosh Bloch (in Effective Java, which is a must read for Java programmers imho) promoted the typesafe enum pattern that became the Java 5+ enum
p17448
aVIt has a fair amount of boilerplate on it and some corner cases that people didn't tend to cater for, such as serialization not calling a constructor and to ensure you only got one instance you had to override the readResolve() method
p17449
aVFor example:
p17450
aVEdit: Sun has an introduction to typesafe enums
p17451
aVAs for interfaces, they really complement enums rather than being an alternative
p17452
aVLike you could say that Suit is an interface and you'd have this:
p17453
aVThe problem is that you could go and define 300 different suits and you could also define Spades several times
p17454
aVAnother advantage of enums is (classloading corner cases notwithstanding) is that there is only one instance of each enum value
p17455
aVTypically this is referred to as having a canonical value, meaning this equality holds true:
p17456
aVfor all a, b that are instances of a particular Enum
p17457
aVThis means that instead of writing:
p17458
aVyou can write:
p17459
aVwhich is quicker and typically easier to read

VThis isn't the kind of question that can be answered here in anything other than a broad overview
p17467
aVSome general pointers:
p17468
aVHardware: the two choices are basically lots of small, cheap boxes or fewer number of more powerful boxes
p17469
aVCheaper boxes are, well, cheaper but typically consume a lot more power for the same CPU or memory (whichever is important to you) than bigger boxes
p17470
aVPeople often forget about the sometimes significant cost of power consumption;
p17471
aVBackend: you have a few choices from the big end of town (Oracle, SQL Server) to the commoditzed end (MySQL)
p17472
aVMySQL is obviously cheaper and you can go far on MySQL but there is no question that Oracle (which I'm more familiar with than SQL Server) has a better optimizer, is more capable and is more robust than MySQL
p17473
aVYou will however pay for it;
p17474
aVBudget: this is a huge factor as it might be worth paying for good commercial software rather than paying development costs to use "free" software
p17475
aVSoftware development is one of the most expensive costs of all;
p17476
aVVertical and horizontal scalability: the question you're basically seeking to answer here is do you build up (bigger boxes, etc) or build out (clustered environments)
p17477
aVThe most scalable solutions have near-linear horizontal scalability but in the shorter term vertical scalability can be cheaper
p17478
aVAs for your normal stack, I'd stick with it unless you've got a particular requirement you haven't mentioned that prohibits it
p17479
aVAfter all PHP is a proven technology that runs 4 or so of the top 20 sites on the Internet (Facebook, Wikipedia, Flickr and I think Yahoo)
p17480
aVIf it's good enough for them, it's good enough for you

aVBeware the "greener pasture" trap of the latest hyped-up technology stack

aVMemcache is good
p17485
aVThe other thing you might want to consider adding to the mix is beanstalkd as a distributed work queue processor
p17486
aVOne important question to answer is: how well can you partition your application
p17487
aVApplications that easily lend themselves to partitioning are far easier to scale
p17488
aVThose that aren't tend to be modified in some way to make them easier to partition
p17489

VWhat you've written isn't threadsafe
p17498
aVIn fact, you've stumbled onto a common fallacy that is quite a famous problem
p17499
aVIt's called the double-checked locking problem and many such solutions as yours (and there are several variations on this theme) all have issues
p17500
aVThere are a few potential solutions to this but imho the easiest is simply to use a ScheduledThreadExecutorService and reload what you need every minute or however often you need to
p17501
aVWhen you reload it put it into the cache result and the calls for it just return the latest version
p17502
aVThis is threadsafe and easy to implement
p17503
aVSure it's not on-demand loaded but, apart from the initial value, you'll never take a performance hit while you retrieve the value
p17504
aVI'd call this over-eager loading rather than lazy-loading
p17505
aVFor example:
p17506
aVThat takes a little explanation
p17507
aVBasically, you're creating a generic interface for caching the result of a Callable, which will be your document load
p17508
aVSubmitting a Callable (or Runnable) returns a Future
p17509
aVCalling Future
p17510
aVget() blocks until it returns (completes)
p17511
aVSo what this does is implement a get() method in terms of a Future so initial queries won't fail (they will block)
p17512
aVAfter that, every 'ttl' milliseconds the refresh method is called
p17513
aVIt submits the method to the scheduler and calls Future
p17514
aVget(), which yields and waits for the result to complete
p17515
aVOnce complete, it replaces the 'result' member
p17516
aVSubsequence Cache
p17517
aVget() calls will return the new value
p17518
aVThere is a scheduleWithFixedRate() method on ScheduledExecutorService but I avoid it because if the Callable takes longer than the scheduled delay you will end up with multiple running at the same time and then have to worry about that or throttling
p17519

aVTag selectors are reasonably fast

aVAlso, I find it good practice to make your CSS selectors as restrictive as possible otherwise it just turns into a mess and you end up getting all sorts of unintended consequences where CSS rules apply where you didn't otherwise expect, which often forces you to create a similar yet different selector just so none of the rules regarding the first don't apply (translating into more mess)

p17571
aVThey're a waste of your time
p17572
aVEdit: if you're after non-sequential IDs that are the same length, consider using UUIDs instead of auto-increment primary keys
p17573
aVBasically this is done at application level:
p17574

p17624
aVIn PHP this is trivial to do
p17625

p17626
aVWhatever you do don't try and do this with regular expressions
p17627
aVIt will be incredibly tedious and error-prone
p17628
aVEdit: There are three basic possibilities for doing this:
p17629
aVDo it in PHP
p17630
aVThis will be the fastest (to develop) and simplest option;
p17631
aVRun a command line PHP script to either do this or generate a series of tokens that can be interpreted by a C# program
p17632
aVThis is the next easiest;
p17633
aVUse Phalanger, a port of PHP to the
p17634
aVNet framework
p17635
aVThis might be more palatable to management since it's still all
p17636
aVNet code; or
p17637
aVUse Quercus, a port of PHP to the Java VM
p17638
aVAnything else will involve either writing a PHP parser (a lot of work) or using really flaky regular expressions that will be an unreliable support nightmare
p17639
aVTo be concerned about supposed "security flaws" of PHP has several problems:
p17640
aVAny framework or technology stack can have security flaws
p17641
aVThe fact that your sysadmin only allows
p17642
aVNet effectively under protest over Java just indicates irrational bias
p17643

p17644
aVNet and PHP can all have security flaws;
p17645
aVYou can run PHP from the command line so it doesn't serve any HTTP requests, which diminishes the issue of security flaws to basically zero;

VThe way to handle this kind of situation is to not to cache writes from multiple places or to control access in some other way
p17742
aVA simple solution to this is to not do any writes to the cache from your clients
p17743
aVInstead if you want to update the value you fire off a request to have the value updated
p17744
aVIf that value is retrieved from somewhere else then this can work well

p17746
aVA common component to use with memcache\u2014at least in the PHP world\u2014is beanstalkd as a distributed work queue processor
p17747
aVIn this scenario you can fire off an "update cache" request as a unit of work
p17748
aVIf you are doing an operation on the cache entry that uses the existing value as an input or in some other way would introduce a race condition if get-then-update weren't an atomic operation, an alternative is to create a unit of work that includes the old value and the new value
p17749
aVThat way, whatever process handles the updates can invalidate or otherwise handle those situations where the current value isn't the expected value

aV"This doesn't work" just isn't good enough
p17763
aVIn one system I developed (a Web reporting system) I generated all the input data on each generated report

p17766

aVany database input

aVLong answer: Java generics work by type erasure, meaning that at runtime that parameter is simply a List, not a List of a generic type

VThere is no single "right" answer to this question
p18039
aVAs a Java programmer of some 10+ years when asked this question my usual answer is
p18040
aVPHP
p18041
aVThere are several reasons for this:
p18042
aVLow resource usage (Apache, nginx);
p18043
aVCheaper hosting;
p18044
aVReally low barrier to entry;
p18045
aVIt's really Web-oriented rather than being general purpose that can be used for Web (like Java);
p18046
aVThe fact that PHP scripts aren't persistent (like Java servlets are) between requests makes them much more forgiving and less likely to cause memory leaks and other problems;
p18047
aVNo deployment step (like Python, Perl, etc)
p18048
aVI'd say this is about the best thing about dynamic scripted languages
p18049
aVJust save the file and click reload on your browser;
p18050
aVPHP might be inconsistent in syntax and several other things but it's also mature and used by some really large sites on the Web (eg Facebook, Yahoo, Flickr, Wikipedia);
p18051
aVPHP is by far the most popular Web development language
p18052
aVWidgets can be done by any manner of Javascript frameworks like YUI, ExtJS, SmartClient, jQuery UI, etc;
p18053
aVPHP fits well with MySQL
p18054
aVThat being said, a lot of these apply to other languages too (eg Python/Django)
p18055
aVI don't think you necessarily need a framework for PHP but if you do I'd look at one or more of:
p18056
aVKohana: it's like a more modern version of the more popular CodeIgniter;
p18057

VHaving a factory method implies\u2014but does not always mean\u2014that the object has no public default constructor
p18447
aVThe idea being that if there is a factory method (for example) that you shouldn't be able to bypass it and create one directly
p18448
aVIn the most simplistic cases there is very little reason to have a public constructor rather than a public static method that returns a new object and the object only has private/protected constructors
p18449
aVThat being said, there are cases where you either need to have public default constructors or it is very inconvenient not to have them
p18450
aVExamples include using Spring's BeanWrapper
p18451
aVCertain methods require a default constructor
p18452
aVUsing a JavaBeans interface requires it
p18453
aVReflection can be awkward without it (which is part of the reason for the previous two) and so on
p18454
aVIn those cases having a factory is probably of little value unless your factory is returning an interface and that class implements the interface
p18455
aVThen again, it can also be argued that most (if not all) return types (and parameter types) should be interfaces not classes anyway but that's a whole separate argument
p18456
aVAnother potential disadvantage of having factories is that it can decrease testability in that the factory can have an annoying tendency to rely on or modify some form of external state

VUltimately I would look at it this way: a DSL (like any programming language) is a set of lexical tokens and idioms that you can use to explain how to do something
p18526
aVImplicit within that set of tokens is a set of idioms
p18527
aVThe idea of any language is that you select an appropriate one that makes it easier to express expected algorithms
p18528
aVA good example are reporting languages (eg Natural)
p18529
aVThat's because reports have common idioms like groups, breaking conditions and so on
p18530
aVAnyone who has done that in a general purpose language would tell you that it can be really tedious to do things like break conditions but it's certainly possible
p18531
aVSo the question you should be asking is this: are there any common idioms that would be tedious, difficult or extremely verbose to express in a general purpose language
p18532
aVYou should also be asking: is there a particular subset of functionality that you are most interested in that would benefit by making it a language concept
p18533
aVThis could be things like vectors and matrices for linear algebra (with the appropriate operations) or the same for integral/differnetial calculus or differential equations
p18534
aVWhat you'd really like to have in the end with a DSL is where, say, a 500 line program could be express as 50-100 lines of your DSL and this applies for most "expected" algorithms
p18535
aVI guess it's a little like normalization in data modelling where the goal is to remove repeating groups
p18536
aVWriting the same 10-20 lines of code with a little variation suggests a common idiom
p18537
aVAs for a library of functions, that is a more limited view of the same thing (ultimately) except that a library of function is merely a package of different behaviours
p18538
aVThat ssumes you define a library of functions as just that and don't instead include complex object hierarchies, closures and so on
p18539
aVIf you do then the line between a "library of functions" and a DSL is blurred
p18540
aVI would think of a library of functions as, say, the set of math functions that exist in most modern languages (sin, cos, square root and so forth)

aVThe most common reason given for using

aV@import instead (or along with)

aVis because older browsers didn't
p18786
aVrecognize @import, so you could hide

aVThat's talking about hiding things from IE4, which is why I said "mostly irrelevant"

aVFirstly, you're defining your code within an anonymous function
p18827
aVThis construct:

aVdoes two things
p18829
aVIt defines an anonymous function and calls it
p18830
aVThere are scope reasons to do this but I'm not sure it's what you actually want
p18831
aVYou're passing in a code block to
p18832
aVThe problem is that  is not within scope when executed like that
p18833
aVIt however if you pass in a function pointer instead so this works:
p18834
aVbecause the function pointer  is within scope of that block
p18835
aVBut like I said, there is no need for the anonymous function so you can rewrite it like this:
p18836
aVor
p18837
aVand both of these work
p18838
aVThe second works because the  within the code block is within scope now
p18839
aVI also prefer the  shortened block form and rather than calling  within  you can just use  instead:

aVYou can certainly do:
p18857
aVwhere you create a JFrameBuilder class that reads the XML and creates an object from it but the variable name can't be dynamic
p18858
aVYou have to remember that there are two steps in Java
p18859
aVJava source files are compiled into bytecode;
p18860
aVThe bytecode is read by a Java interpreter (JVM) and executed
p18861

aVI built a site like this once where the external JS file had:

p19216
aVIt was a performance disaster and that was with relatively efficient selector choice, meaning never:
p19217
aVInstead:
p19218
aVand so on
p19219
aVIt took about a second to execute all the Javascript even though 95% of it was doing nothing
p19220
aVMy advice
p19221
aVIf you want a highly responsive Web site don't do it this way
p19222
aVInstead put functions like this in your external JS:
p19223
aVThis is of course a simple example
p19224
aVBut the point is this: no Javascript should be automatically executed in your external Javascript file unless the vast majority of pages use it
p19225
aVYour external Javascript file should just be a collection of functionality that is called where necessary on individual pages
p19226
aVand then on each page inside the HTML put:
p19227
aVso you only execute the Javascript you are actually using
p19228
aVYes this is slightly more work because you have to be aware of what each page is doing/using but doing it globally can quickly get out of hand

p19358
aVSearch engines are an obvious application for this but there are others
p19359

p19523
aVIn MySQL it also depends on what database engine you use
p19524
aVThe term you're looking for (in ANSI SQL terms) is "isolation level"
p19525
aVMany databases will default to an isolation level where reads on uncommitted data will block
p19526
aVSo if transaction A updates record 1234 in table T and then transaction B tries to select record 1234 before A commits or rolls back then B will block until A does one of those things
p19527
aVSee MySQL Transactions, Part II - Transaction Isolation Levels
p19528
aVOne serious downside of this is that batch update operations that live in long-running transactions (typically) can potentially block many requests
p19529
aVYou can also set it so B will see uncommitted data but that is often ill-advised
p19530
aVAlternatively you can use a scheme called MVCC ("Multiversion concurrency control"), which will give different transactions a consistent view of the data based on the time the transaction started

p19550
aVFor example, this is legal Java:
p19551
aVFixed arrays can be done this way but it can be awkward
p19552
aVIt's often easier to use a single dimensional array with an object wrapper:
p19553
aVThis can of course be done with arrays of arrays instead
p19554
aVSparse arrays tend to be implemented in Java with maps:
p19555
aVYou can also do this by constructing an N-dimensional key class to use as the map key
p19556
aVIt would need the appropriate  and  methods defined and would probably be a cleaner solution but the above will work
p19557
aVObviously if you were going to store every value of a 100x100 array in the sparse array class there would be an overhead (as all maps have overheads)
p19558
aVThis brings in the dense array
p19559
aVThe sparse array only stores values where values are set
p19560
aVThe dense array stores a value for every possible key (within the specified range)
p19561
aVAlso the dense array is similar to the fixed array but not quite the same
p19562
aVFixed arrays are hard to extend once created (well, it's an expensive operation so it's generally not allowed) whereas dense arrays might be built to be extended, like you could use them for a spreadsheet and extend the max X and Y values are the user uses more and more cells so you define a rectangle encompassing all used values

VHere's one solution:
p19652
aVBasically the magic here is , which changes the CSS visual formatting model
p19653
aVTake a look at CSS layout fundamentals, part 5: floats:
p19654
aVFixing adjacent boxes
p19655
aVLet\u2019s look at the red paragraph border
p19656
aVproblem first
p19657
aVThe reason the
p19658
aVparagraph border appears behind the
p19659
aVimage is because floats don\u2019t
p19660
aVreposition block boxes that are
p19661
aVadjacent to them
p19662
aVIn this example, the
p19663
aVfloated image is only pushing the line
p19664
aVboxes inside the paragraph across
p19665
aVSo
p19666
aVthe text is pushed to the right, but
p19667
aVthe actual paragraph box still
p19668
aVstretches across the full width of the
p19669
aVcontainer
p19670
aVThe fix for this issue comes from a
p19671
aVvery well-hidden paragraph in the
p19672
aVfloats section of the CSS 2
p19673
ag2257
aVspecification:
p19674
aVThe border box of a table, a
p19675
aVblock-level replaced element, or an
p19676
aVelement in the normal flow that
p19677
aVestablishes a new block formatting
p19678
aVcontext (such as an element with
p19679
aV\u2018overflow\u2019 other than \u2018visible\u2019) must
p19680
aVnot overlap any floats in the same
p19681
aVblock formatting context as the
p19682
aVelement itself
p19683
aVSo to prevent our paragraph block from
p19684
aVoverlapping the floated content, the
p19685
aVsolution is to create a \u201cnew block
p19686
aVformatting context\u201d, in CSS
p19687
aVspecification author terminology
p19688
aVSounds tricky, eh
p19689
aVFortunately, it
p19690
aVisn\u2019t that hard
p19691
aVNew block formatting
p19692
aVcontexts are created by any block

p19697
aV(inline-block, table-cell, etc
p19698
aVhas its overflow property set to something other than visible
p19699
aVThe last option is the one that is
p19700
aVeasiest to do in most cases: setting
p19701
aVoverflow: auto on our paragraph will
p19702
aVcreate a new \u201cblock formatting
p19703
aVcontext\u201d, and render the paragraph

VThis to me sounds like a reasonably common problem that junior to intermediate developers tend to face at some point: they either don't know or don't trust the contracts they are participating in and defensively overcheck for nulls
p19941
aVAdditionally, when writing their own code, they tend to rely on returning nulls to indicate something thus requiring the caller to check for nulls
p19942
aVTo put this another way, there are two instances where null checking comes up:
p19943
aVWhere null is a valid response in terms of the contract; and
p19944
aVWhere it isn't a valid response
p19945
aV(2) is easy
p19946
aVEither use  statements (assertions) or allow failure (for example,  NullPointerException)
p19947
aVAssertions are a highly-underused Java feature that was added in 1
p19948
ag6339
aVThe syntax is:
p19949
aVor
p19950
aVwhere 's  output will be included in the error
p19951
aVAn  statement throws an  () if the condition is not true
p19952
aVBy default, Java ignores assertions
p19953
aVYou can enable assertions by passing the option  to the JVM
p19954
aVYou can enable and disable assertions for individual classes and packages
p19955
aVThis means that you can validate code with the assertions while developing and testing, and disable them in a production environment, although my testing has shown next to no performance impact from assertions
p19956
aVNot using assertions in this case is OK because the code will just fail, which is what will happen if you use assertions
p19957
aVThe only difference is that with assertions it might happen sooner, in a more-meaningful way and possibly with extra information, which may help you to figure out why it happened if you weren't expecting it
p19958
aV(1) is a little harder
p19959
aVIf you have no control over the code you're calling then you're stuck
p19960
aVIf null is a valid response, you have to check for it
p19961
aVIf it's code that you do control, however (and this is often the case), then it's a different story
p19962
aVAvoid using nulls as a response
p19963
aVWith methods that return collections, it's easy: return empty collections (or arrays) instead of nulls pretty much all the time
p19964
aVWith non-collections it might be harder
p19965
aVConsider this as an example: if you have these interfaces:
p19966
aVwhere Parser takes raw user input and finds something to do, perhaps if you're implementing a command line interface for something
p19967
aVNow you might make the contract that it returns null if there's no appropriate action
p19968
aVThat leads the null checking you're talking about
p19969
aVAn alternative solution is to never return null and instead use the Null Object pattern:
p19970
aVCompare:
p19971
aVto
p19972
aVwhich is a much better design because it leads to more concise code
p19973
aVThat said, perhaps it is entirely appropriate for the findAction() method to throw an Exception with a meaningful error message -- especially in this case where you are relying on user input
p19974
aVIt would be much better for the findAction method to throw an Exception than for the calling method to blow up with a simple NullPointerException with no explanation
p19975
aVOr if you think the try/catch mechanism is too ugly, rather than Do Nothing your default action should provide feedback to the user

aVSo the algorithm is simply:
p20035
aVNormalize a and b to ;
p20036
aVCompute the shortest angle between the two normal angles
p20037
aVFor the first step, to convert the angle to the desired range, there are two possibilities:
p20038
aV: normal = x % 360
p20039
aV: normal = (-x / 360 + 1) * 360 + x
p20040
aVThe second is designed to remove any ambiguity on the difference in interpretation of negative modulus operations
p20041
aVSo to give a worked example for x = -400:
p20042
aVthen
p20043
aVso for inputs 10 and -400 the normal angles are 10 and 320
p20044
aVNow we calculate the shortest angle between them
p20045
aVAs a sanity check, the sum of those two angles must be 360
p20046
aVIn this case the possibilities are 50 and 310 (draw it and you'll see this)

aVunfortunately

VThe idea is simply that changes to one file are usually related to changes in another
p20474
aVSome older version control systems didn't really handle multiple files in one commit (as an "atomic commit" as you call it) or they did so poorly
p20475
aVYou don't have to do anything special for this
p20476
aVThat's just how Subversion works
p20477
aVBut with Subversion you do have the option of checking in one file at a time or doing all the modified files at once or anywhere in between
p20478
aVThe idea of doing multiple files as one commit is that\u2014generally speaking\u2014you should be able to check out the repository at any particular version and it will at least compile and hopefully run
p20479
aVThis is important in teams
p20480
aVNow in practice this might not be true 100% of the time but the guiding principle is sound
p20481
aVSo whether you do one file, all your changes at once or something in between what you're checking in should make sense as one commit
p20482
aVLike if you fix a bug and need to modify 8 files, check in all those 8 files as one commit with a message saying what bug you fixed and how you fixed it

VYou're got more of an architectural problem to solve first

aVIn a single-threaded program the sequence is normally:
p20507
aVDo stuff;
p20508
aVCall sendTo();
p20509
aVDo more stuff
p20510
aVYou have to work out if what you want is:

aVDo stuff;
p20512
aVCall sendTo();
p20513
aVIf (2) fails, wait 10 seconds and sendTo() again;
p20514
aVIf (3) fails, throw an error;
p20515
aVDo more stuff
p20516
aVThe point being that this is still synchronous
p20517
aVIf so you'll need a thread
p20518
aVYou should use the Java 5 Executors
p20519
aVNow that's just a rough sketch of how it might work
p20520
aVIt should give you some appreciation for the issues however

aVDo you want this or do you want:

p20822
aVWhen you need something from disk or from a network or the result of a calculation you go and get or do it

p20825
aVLazy
p20826
aVOnce you've done a particular read or calculation don't do it again for some period of time that may be anything from a few milliseconds to forever
p20827
aVThis can add a lot of complexity to your program but if the read or calculation is expensive, can reap enormous benefits; and
p20828
aVOver-eager
p20829
aVThis is much like a combination of the previous two
p20830
aVResults are cached but instead of doing the read or calculation or requested there is a certain amount of preemptive activity to anticipate what you might want
p20831
aVLike if you read 10K from a file, there is a reasonably high likelihood that you might later want the next 10K block
p20832
aVRather than delay execution you get it just in case it's requested
p20833
aVThe lesson to take from this is the (somewhat over-used and often mis-quoted) quote from Donald Knuth that "premature optimization is the root of all evil
p20834
aVEager and over-eager solutions add a huge amount of complexity so there is no point doing them for something that won't yield a useful benefit

aVProgrammers often make the mistake of creating some highly (alleged) optimized version of something before determining if they need to and whether or not it will be useful

p20937

aVHTML2PDF looked the most promising but I kept having this weird error about null reference arguments to node_type

aVBasically, PHP 5

p20944

p20945

p20947

p20948
aVThe default value was chosen as 100,000
p20949
aVWhy such a low value
p20950
aVAgain, no idea
p20951
aVA bug was raised against PHP 5
p20952
ag4699
aV1 for this, which is still open almost two years later
p20953
aVWhat's horrifying about this is that when the limit is exceeded, the replace just silently fails
p20954
aVAt least if an error had been raised and logged you'd have some indication of what happened, why and what to change to fix it
p20955
aVBut no
p20956
aVSo I have a 70k HTML file to turn into PDF
p20957
aVIt requires the following php
p20958
aVini settings:
p20959
aVpcre
p20960
aVbacktrack_limit = 2000000; # probably more than I need but that's OK
p20961
aVmemory_limit = 1024M; # yes, one gigabyte; and
p20962
aVmax_execution_time = 600; # yes, 10 minutes
p20963
aVNow the astute reader may have noticed that my HTML file is smaller than 100k
p20964
aVThe only reason I can guess as to why I hit this problem is that html2pdf does a conversion into xhtml as part of the process
p20965
aVPerhaps that took me over (although nearly 50% bloat seems odd)
p20966
aVWhatever the case, the above worked
p20967
aVNow, html2pdf is a resource hog
p20968
aVMy 70k file takes approximately 5 minutes and at least 500-600M of RAM to create a 35 page PDF file
p20969
aVNot quick enough (by far) for a real-time download unfortunately and the memory usage puts the memory usage ratio in the order of 1000-to-1 (600M of RAM for a 70k file), which is utterly ridiculous

VQuick note, this is almost certainly confusing Big O notation (which is an upper bound) with Theta notation (which is a two-side bound)
p21099
aVIn my experience this is actually typical of discussions in non-academic settings
p21100
aVApologies for any confusion caused
p21101
aVThe simplest definition I can give for Big-O notation is this:
p21102
aVBig-O notation is a relative representation of the complexity of an algorithm
p21103
aVThere are some important and deliberately chosen words in that sentence:
p21104
aVrelative: you can only compare apples to apples
p21105
aVYou can't compare an algorithm to do arithmetic multiplication to an algorithm that sorts a list of integers
p21106
aVBut a comparison of two algorithms to do arithmetic operations (one multiplication, one addition) will tell you something meaningful;
p21107
aVrepresentation: Big-O (in its simplest form) reduces the comparison between algorithms to a single variable
p21108
aVThat variable is chosen based on observations or assumptions
p21109
aVFor example, sorting algorithms are typically compared based on comparison operations (comparing two nodes to determine their relative ordering)
p21110
aVThis assumes that comparison is expensive
p21111
aVBut what if comparison is cheap but swapping is expensive
p21112
aVIt changes the comparison; and
p21113
aVcomplexity: if it takes me one second to sort 10,000 elements how long will it take me to sort one million
p21114
aVComplexity in this instance is a relative measure to something else
p21115
aVCome back and reread the above when you've read the rest
p21116
aVThe best example of Big-O I can think of is doing arithmetic
p21117
aVTake two numbers (123456 and 789012)
p21118
aVThe basic arithmetic operations we learnt in school were:
p21119
aVaddition;
p21120
aVsubtraction;
p21121
aVmultiplication; and
p21122
aVdivision
p21123
aVEach of these is an operation or a problem
p21124
aVA method of solving these is called an algorithm
p21125
aVAddition is the simplest
p21126
aVYou line the numbers up (to the right) and add the digits in a column writing the last number of that addition in the result
p21127
aVThe 'tens' part of that number is carried over to the next column
p21128
aVLet's assume that the addition of these numbers is the most expensive operation in this algorithm
p21129
aVIt stands to reason that to add these two numbers together we have to add together 6 digits (and possibly carry a 7th)
p21130
aVIf we add two 100 digit numbers together we have to do 100 additions
p21131
aVIf we add two 10,000 digit numbers we have to do 10,000 additions
p21132
aVSee the pattern
p21133
aVThe complexity (being the number of operations) is directly proportional to the number of digits n in the larger number
p21134
aVWe call this O(n) or linear complexity
p21135
aVSubtraction is similar (except you may need to borrow instead of carry)
p21136
aVMultiplication is different
p21137
aVYou line the numbers up, take the first digit in the bottom number and multiply it in turn against each digit in the top number and so on through each digit
p21138
aVSo to multiply our two 6 digit numbers we must do 36 multiplications
p21139
aVWe may need to do as many as 10 or 11 column adds to get the end result too
p21140
aVIf we have two 100-digit numbers we need to do 10,000 multiplications and 200 adds
p21141
aVFor two one million digit numbers we need to do one trillion (1012) multiplications and two million adds
p21142
aVAs the algorithm scales with n-squared, this is O(n2) or quadratic complexity
p21143
aVThis is a good time to introduce another important concept:
p21144
aVWe only care about the most significant portion of complexity
p21145
aVThe astute may have realized that we could express the number of operations as: n2 + 2n
p21146
aVBut as you saw from our example with two numbers of a million digits apiece, the second term (2n) becomes insignificant (accounting for 0
p21147
aV0002% of the total operations by that stage)
p21148
aVOne can notice that we've assumed the worst case scenario here
p21149
aVWhile multiplying 6 digit numbers if one of them is 4 digit and the other one is 6 digit, then we only have 24 multiplications
p21150
aVStill we calculate the worst case scenario for that 'n', i
p21151
aVe when both are 6 digit numbers
p21152
aVHence Big-O notation is about the Worst-case scenario of an algorithm
p21153
aVThe Telephone Book
p21154
aVThe next best example I can think of is the telephone book, normally called the White Pages or similar but it'll vary from country to country
p21155
aVBut I'm talking about the one that lists people by surname and then initials or first name, possibly address and then telephone numbers
p21156
aVNow if you were instructing a computer to look up the phone number for "John Smith" in a telephone book that contains 1,000,000 names, what would you do
p21157
aVIgnoring the fact that you could guess how far in the S's started (let's assume you can't), what would you do
p21158
aVA typical implementation might be to open up to the middle, take the 500,000th and compare it to "Smith"
p21159
aVIf it happens to be "Smith, John", we just got real lucky
p21160
aVFar more likely is that "John Smith" will be before or after that name
p21161
aVIf it's after we then divide the last half of the phone book in half and repeat
p21162
aVIf it's before then we divide the first half of the phone book in half and repeat
p21163
aVAnd so on
p21164
aVThis is called a binary search and is used every day in programming whether you realize it or not
p21165
aVSo if you want to find a name in a phone book of a million names you can actually find any name by doing this at most 20 times
p21166
aVIn comparing search algorithms we decide that this comparison is our 'n'
p21167
aVFor a phone book of 3 names it takes 2 comparisons (at most)
p21168
aVFor 7 it takes at most 3
p21169
aVFor 15 it takes 4
p21170
aV\u2026
p21171
aVFor 1,000,000 it takes 20
p21172
aVThat is staggeringly good isn't it
p21173
aVIn Big-O terms this is O(log n) or logarithmic complexity
p21174
aVNow the logarithm in question could be ln (base e), log10, log2 or some other base
p21175
aVIt doesn't matter it's still O(log n) just like O(2n2) and O(100n2) are still both O(n2)
p21176
aVIt's worthwhile at this point to explain that Big O can be used to determine three cases with an algorithm:
p21177
aVBest Case: In the telephone book search, the best case is that we find the name in one comparison
p21178
aVThis is O(1) or constant complexity;
p21179
aVExpected Case: As discussed above this is O(log n); and
p21180
aVWorst Case: This is also O(log n)
p21181
aVNormally we don't care about the best case
p21182
aVWe're interested in the expected and worst case
p21183
aVSometimes one or the other of these will be more important
p21184
aVBack to the telephone book
p21185
aVWhat if you have a phone number and want to find a name
p21186
aVThe police have a reverse phone book but such look-ups are denied to the general public
p21187
aVOr are they
p21188
aVTechnically you can reverse look-up a number in an ordinary phone book
p21189
aVHow
p21190
aVYou start at the first name and compare the number
p21191
aVIf it's a match, great, if not, you move on to the next
p21192
aVYou have to do it this way because the phone book is unordered (by phone number anyway)
p21193
aVSo to find a name given the phone number (reverse lookup):
p21194
aVBest Case: O(1);
p21195
aVExpected Case: O(n) (for 500,000); and
p21196
aVWorst Case: O(n) (for 1,000,000)

aVThe Travelling Salesman
p21198
aVThis is quite a famous problem in computer science and deserves a mention
p21199
aVIn this problem you have N towns
p21200
aVEach of those towns is linked to 1 or more other towns by a road of a certain distance
p21201
aVThe Travelling Salesman problem is to find the shortest tour that visits every town
p21202
aVSounds simple
p21203
aVThink again
p21204
aVIf you have 3 towns A, B and C with roads between all pairs then you could go:
p21205
aVA \u2192 B \u2192 C
p21206
aVA \u2192 C \u2192 B
p21207
aVB \u2192 C \u2192 A
p21208
aVB \u2192 A \u2192 C
p21209
aVC \u2192 A \u2192 B
p21210
aVC \u2192 B \u2192 A
p21211
aVWell actually there's less than that because some of these are equivalent (A \u2192 B \u2192 C and C \u2192 B \u2192 A are equivalent, for example, because they use the same roads, just in reverse)
p21212
aVIn actuality there are 3 possibilities
p21213
aVTake this to 4 towns and you have (iirc) 12 possibilities
p21214
aVWith 5 it's 60
p21215
aV6 becomes 360
p21216
aVThis is a function of a mathematical operation called a factorial
p21217
aVBasically:
p21218
ag3255
aV= 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120
p21219
ag18560
aV= 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 720

VShort answer: No
p21256
aVLong answer: Games actually aren't all that complicated
p21257
aVIt depends on what you're talking about when you say "games" but the two contenders for most complex games would be 3D games and online games (particularly massively online games)
p21258
aVThe complication in 3D games comes from taking a model of a world and rendering it in 3D and to have it behave in a "realistic" (within the rules of the world) way
p21259
aVCreating a visual and auditory environment from that isn't actually that hard
p21260
aVIt's pretty much all linear algebra and is a mature field of computer science
p21261
aVThe real trick comes in making that process performant in real-time
p21262
aVOver the years game programmers have had to make a LOT of tradeoffs between realism and performance (eg if you can make a performance algorithm that'll generate realistic looking trees that's actually worth a lot of money)
p21263
aVSo games have naturally gotten better (visually) over the years as computing and graphics power has increased
p21264
aVNow some game programmers have made real innovations in this field that have (rightly) earnt them a lot of money
p21265
aVJohn Carmack (id Software: Doom and Quake) and Tim Sweeney (Unreal) spring to mind
p21266
aVThe real cost however in making games is the content
p21267
aVJust go look at the credits for a modern FPS (first person shooter) game and you'll typically see as little as 6 programmers but there'll be 30-50+ artists
p21268
aVContent isn't complex (from a software point of view)
p21269
aVIt's just time consuming
p21270
aVAs for online games, I remember when Everquest came out and people raved about how hard it was
p21271
aVBzzzt, wrong
p21272
aVFor those (like myself) who were familiar with the development of MUDs (mutli-user dungeons) through the 90s (and possibly 80s), architecturally an Everquest server wasn't that complicated
p21273
aVSame goes for World of Warcraft or any of these other games
p21274
aVIf you want to talk about complex, how about the Windows XP operating system these things run on which has an estimated 40 million lines of code
p21275
aVGod knows how many Vista has
p21276
aVOr what about the Linux kernel

VShort answer
p21297
aVSometimes
p21298
aVTechnically every abstraction has a cost and a programming language is an abstraction for how the CPU works
p21299
aVC however is very close
p21300
aVYears ago I remember laughing out loud when I logged onto my UNIX account and got the following fortune message (when such things were popular):
p21301
aVThe C Programming Language -- A
p21302
aVlanguage which combines the
p21303
aVflexibility of assembly language with
p21304
aVthe power of assembly language
p21305
aVIt's funny because it's true: C is like portable assembly language
p21306
aVIt's worth noting that assembly language just runs however you write it
p21307
aVThere is however a compiler in between C and the assembly language it generates and that is extremely important because how fast your C code is has an awful lot to do with how good your compiler is
p21308
aVWhen gcc came on the scene one of the things that made it so popular was that it was often so much better than the C compilers that shipped with many commercial UNIX flavours
p21309
aVNot only was it ANSI C (none of this K&R; C rubbish), was more robust and typically produced better (faster) code
p21310
aVNot always but often
p21311
aVI tell you all this because there is no blanket rule about the speed of C and assembler because there is no objective standard for C
p21312
aVLikewise, assembler varies a lot depending on what processor you're running, your system spec, what instruction set you're using and so on
p21313
aVHistorically there have been two CPU architecture families: CISC and RISC
p21314
aVThe biggest player in CISC was and still is the Intel x86 architecture (and instruction set)
p21315
aVRISC dominated the UNIX world (MIPS6000, Alpha, Sparc and so on)
p21316
aVCISC won the battle for the hearts and minds
p21317
aVAnyway, the popular wisdom when I was a younger developer was that hand-written x86 could often be much faster than C because the way the architecture worked, it had a complexity that benefitted from a human doing it
p21318
aVRISC on the other hand seemed designed for compilers so noone (I knew) wrote say Sparc assembler
p21319
aVI'm sure such people existed but no doubt they've both gone insane and been institutionalized by now
p21320
aVInstruction sets are an important point even in the same family of processors
p21321
aVCertain Intel processors have extensions like SSE through SSE4
p21322
aVAMD had their own SIMD instructions
p21323
aVThe benefit of a programming language like C was someone could write their library so it was optimized for whichever processor you were running on
p21324
aVThat was hard work in assembler
p21325
aVThere are still optimizations you can make in assembler that no compiler could make and a well written assembler algoirthm will be as fast or faster than it's C equivalent
p21326
aVThe bigger question is: is it worth it
p21327
aVUltimately though assembler was a product of its time and was more popular at a time when CPU cycles were expensive
p21328
aVNowadays a CPU that costs $5-10 to manufacture (Intel Atom) can do pretty much anything anyone could want
p21329
aVThe only real reason to write assembler these days is for low level things like some parts of an operating system (even so the vast majority of the Linux kernel is written in C), device drivers, possibly embedded devices (although C tends to dominate there too) and so on
p21330
aVOr just for kicks (which is somewhat masochistic)

aVUsing natural rather than surrogate (technical) primary keys
p21374
aVNatural keys are keys based on externally meaningful data that is (ostensibly) unique
p21375
aVCommon examples are product codes, two-letter state codes (US), social security numbers and so on
p21376
aVSurrogate or technical primary keys are those that have absolutely no meaning outside the system
p21377
aVThey are invented purely for identifying the entity and are typically auto-incrementing fields (SQL Server, MySQL, others) or sequences (most notably Oracle)
p21378
aVIn my opinion you should always use surrogate keys
p21379
aVThis issue has come up in these questions:
p21380
aVHow do you like your primary keys
p21381
aVWhat's the best practice for primary keys in tables
p21382
aVWhich format of primary key would you use in this situation
p21383
aVSurrogate vs
p21384
aVnatural/business keys
p21385
aVShould I have a dedicated primary key field
p21386
aVThis is a somewhat controversial topic on which you won't get universal agreement
p21387
aVWhile you may find some people, who think natural keys are in some situations OK, you won't find any criticism of surrogate keys other than being arguably unnecessary
p21388

p21389
aVRemember, even countries can cease to exist (for example, Yugoslavia)

p21393
aVThis is a bit of a shortcut to ensuring you don't return duplicate rows and thus get duplicate objects
p21394
aVYou'll sometimes see people doing this as well
p21395
aVIf you see it too much it's a real red flag
p21396
aVNot that  is bad or doesn't have valid applications

aVIt does (on both counts) but it's not a surrogate or a stopgap for writing correct queries

p21399

p21402

p21405
aVand his immediate response
p21406
aVhis
p21407

ag3255
aVFavouring aggregation over joins
p21411
aVAnother common mistake by database application developers is to not realize how much more expensive aggregation (ie the  clause) can be compared to joins
p21412
aVTo give you an idea of how widespread this is, I've written on this topic several times here and been downvoted a lot for it
p21413
aVFor example:
p21414
aVFrom SQL statement - \u201cjoin\u201d vs \u201cgroup by and having\u201d:
p21415
aVFirst query:
p21416
aVQuery time: 0
p21417
aV312 s
p21418
aVSecond query:
p21419
aVQuery time: 0
p21420
aV016 s
p21421
aVThat's right

aVproposed is twenty times faster than
p21424
aVthe aggregate version
p21425
ag18560
aVNot simplifying complex queries through views
p21426
aVNot all database vendors support views but for those that do, they can greatly simplify queries if used judiciously
p21427
aVFor example, on one project I used a generic Party model for CRM
p21428
aVThis is an extremely powerful and flexible modelling technique but can lead to many joins
p21429
aVIn this model there were:
p21430
aVParty: people and organisations;
p21431
aVParty Role: things those parties did, for example Employee and Employer;
p21432
aVParty Role Relationship: how those roles related to each other
p21433
aVExample:
p21434
aVTed is a Person, being a subtype of Party;
p21435
aVTed has many roles, one of which is Employee;
p21436
aVIntel is an organisation, being a subtype of a Party;
p21437
aVIntel has many roles, one of which is Employer;
p21438
aVIntel employs Ted, meaning there is a relationship between their respective roles
p21439
aVSo there are five tables joined to link Ted to his employer
p21440
aVYou assume all employees are Persons (not organisations) and provide this helper view:
p21441
aVAnd suddenly you have a very simple view of the data you want but on a highly flexible data model
p21442
ag16639
aVNot sanitizing input
p21443
aVThis is a huge one
p21444
aVNow I like PHP but if you don't know what you're doing it's really easy to create sites vulnerable to attack
p21445
aVNothing sums it up better than the story of little Bobby Tables
p21446
aVData provided by the user by way of URLs, form data and cookies should always be treated as hostile and sanitized
p21447
aVMake sure you're getting what you expect
p21448
aV8
p21449
aVNot using prepared statements
p21450
aVPrepared statements are when you compile a query minus the data used in inserts, updates and  clauses and then supply that later
p21451
aVFor example:
p21452
aVvs
p21453
aVor
p21454
aVdepending on your platform
p21455
aVI've seen databases brought to their knees by doing this
p21456
aVBasically, each time any modern database encounters a new query it has to compile it
p21457
aVIf it encounters a query it's seen before, you're giving the database the opportunity to cache the compiled query and the execution plan
p21458
aVBy doing the query a lot you're giving the database the opportunity to figure that out and optimize accordingly (for example, by pinning the compiled query in memory)
p21459
aVUsing prepared statements will also give you meaningful statistics about how often certain queries are used
p21460
aVPrepared statements will also better protect you against SQL injection attacks
p21461
ag2500
aVNot normalizing enough
p21462
aVDatabase normalization is basically the process of optimizing database design or how you organize your data into tables
p21463
aVJust this week I ran across some code where someone had imploded an array and inserted it into a single field in a database
p21464
aVNormalizing that would be to treat element of that array as a separate row in a child table (ie a one-to-many relationship)
p21465
aVThis also came up in Best method for storing a list of user IDs:
p21466
aVI've seen in other systems that the list is stored in a serialized PHP array
p21467
aVBut lack of normalization comes in many forms

aVSQL by Design: Why You Need Database Normalization

aV10
p21472
aVNormalizing too much
p21473
aVThis may seem like a contradiction to the previous point but normalization, like many things, is a tool
p21474
aVIt is a means to an end and not an end in and of itself
p21475
aVI think many developers forget this and start treating a "means" as an "end"
p21476
aVUnit testing is a prime example of this
p21477
aVI once worked on a system that had a huge hierarchy for clients that went something like:
p21478
aVsuch that you had to join about 11 tables together before you could get any meaningful data
p21479
aVIt was a good example of normalization taken too far

aVUsing exclusive arcs
p21489
aVAn exclusive arc is a common mistake where a table is created with two or more foreign keys where one and only one of them can be non-null
p21490
aVBig mistake
p21491
aVFor one thing it becomes that much harder to maintain data integrity
p21492
aVAfter all, even with referential integrity, nothing is preventing two or more of these foreign keys from being set (complex check constraints notwithstanding)
p21493
aVFrom A Practical Guide to Relational Database Design:
p21494
aVWe have strongly advised against exclusive arc construction wherever
p21495
aVpossible, for the good reason that they can be awkward to write code
p21496
aVand pose more maintenance difficulties
p21497
aV12
p21498
aVNot doing performance analysis on queries at all
p21499
aVPragmatism reigns supreme, particularly in the database world
p21500
aVIf you're sticking to principles to the point that they've become a dogma then you've quite probably made mistakes
p21501
aVTake the example of the aggregate queries from above
p21502
aVThe aggregate version might look "nice" but its performance is woeful
p21503
aVA performance comparison should've ended the debate (but it didn't) but more to the point: spouting such ill-informed views in the first place is ignorant, even dangerous
p21504
aV13
p21505
aVOver-reliance on UNION ALL and particularly UNION constructs
p21506
aVA UNION in SQL terms merely concatenates congruent data sets, meaning they have the same type and number of columns
p21507
aVThe difference between them is that UNION ALL is a simple concatenation and should be preferred wherever possible whereas a UNION will implicitly do a DISTINCT to remove duplicate tuples
p21508
aVUNIONs, like DISTINCT, have their place
p21509
aVThere are valid applications
p21510
aVBut if you find yourself doing a lot of them, particularly in subqueries, then you're probably doing something wrong
p21511
aVThat might be a case of poor query construction or a poorly designed data model forcing you to do such things
p21512
aVUNIONs, particularly when used in joins or dependent subqueries, can cripple a database
p21513
aVTry to avoid them whenever possible
p21514
aV14
p21515
aVUsing OR conditions in queries
p21516
aVThis might seem harmless
p21517
aVAfter all, ANDs are OK
p21518
aVOR should be OK too right
p21519
aVWrong
p21520
aVBasically an AND condition restricts the data set whereas an OR condition grows it but not in a way that lends itself to optimisation
p21521
aVParticularly when the different OR conditions might intersect thus forcing the optimizer to effectively to a DISTINCT operation on the result
p21522
aVBad:
p21523
aVBetter:
p21524
aVNow your SQL optimizer may effectively turn the first query into the second
p21525
aVBut it might not
p21526
aVJust don't do it
p21527
aV15
p21528
aVNot designing their data model to lend itself to high-performing solutions
p21529
aVThis is a hard point to quantify
p21530
aVIt is typically observed by its effect
p21531
aVIf you find yourself writing gnarly queries for relatively simple tasks or that queries for finding out relatively straightforward information are not efficient, then you probably have a poor data model
p21532
aVIn some ways this point summarizes all the earlier ones but it's more of a cautionary tale that doing things like query optimisation is often done first when it should be done second
p21533
aVFirst and foremost you should ensure you have a good data model before trying to optimize the performance
p21534
aVAs Knuth said:
p21535
aVPremature optimization is the root of all evil
p21536
aV16
p21537
aVIncorrect use of Database Transactions
p21538
aVAll data changes for a specific process should be atomic
p21539
aVI
p21540
ag19633
aVIf the operation succeeds, it does so fully
p21541
aVIf it fails, the data is left unchanged
p21542
aV- There should be no possibility of 'half-done' changes
p21543
aVIdeally, the simplest way to achieve this is that the entire system design should strive to support all data changes through single INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE statements
p21544
aVIn this case, no special transaction handling is needed, as your database engine should do so automatically
p21545
aVHowever, if any processes do require multiple statements be performed as a unit to keep the data in a consistent state, then appropriate Transaction Control is necessary
p21546
aVBegin a Transaction before the first statement
p21547
aVCommit the Transaction after the last statement
p21548
aVOn any error, Rollback the Transaction
p21549
aVAnd very NB
p21550
aVDon't forget to skip/abort all statements that follow after the error

VGenerally speaking with databases you rarely delete anything
p21595
aVYou can mark it as deleted but generally speaking you keep it in your database at least for a time
p21596
aVThere are many reasons for this
p21597
aVSome of them are legal
p21598
aVYou may have requirements ot keep data for a given period
p21599
aVSome of them are technical
p21600
aVSometimes its just a safeguard
p21601
aVYou may need to restore the information
p21602
aVThe user may request their account is reopened or it may have been locked due to spamming but that was because the account had been compromised and has now been restored
p21603
aVOld data may be deleted or archived but this may take months or even years
p21604
aVPersonally I just give relevant data a status column (eg 1 = active, 0 = deleted) and then just change the status rather than delete it 99% of the time
p21605
aVData integrity is another issue here
p21606
aVLet me give you an example
p21607
aVAssume you have two entities:
p21608
aVYou want to delete a particular User
p21609
aVWhat do you do about messages they've sent and received
p21610
aVThose messages will appear in someone else's inbox or sent items so you can't delete them
p21611
aVDo you set the relevant field in Message to NULL
p21612
aVThat doesn't make a lot of sense either because that message did come from (or go to) somebody, even if they aren't active anymore
p21613
aVYou're better off just marking that user as deleted and keeping them around
p21614
aVIt makes this and similar situations much easier to deal with
p21615
aVYou also mention forum threads and so on
p21616
aVYou can't delete those either (unless there are other reasons to do so such as spam or abuse) because they're content that is related to other content (eg forum messages that have been replied to)
p21617
aVThe only data you can safely and reasonably delete is child data
p21618
aVThis is really the difference between aggregation and composition
p21619
aVThe User and message relationship above is aggregation
p21620
aVAn example of composition is House and Room
p21621
aVYou delete a House and all the rooms go to
p21622
aVRooms cannot exist without a House
p21623
aVThis is composition or, in entity relationship terms, a parent-child relationship
p21624
aVBut you'll find more instances of aggregation than composition (in my experience) so the question becomes: what do you do with that data
p21625
aVIt's really hard to erase all traces of someone without deleting things you shouldn't
p21626
aVJust mark them as deleted, locked or inactive and deal with it that way

p21644
aVIt's not too dissimilar to Perl although Perl does have a somewhat differen typing system and regular expressions are more first-class in Perl
p21645
aVPlus PHP doesn't have the $_ operator but in spite of all that there are many similarities;
p21646
aVAs a dynamic scripted language, it'll help you get out of the strongly-typed mould, which should make for a bit of a change and useful experience;
p21647

aVKeywords are always in UPPERCASE;

p21740
aVReferential integrity will be enforced;
p21741
aVInteger values (including table ids) will generally always be NUMBER(19,0)
p21742

p21743

p21758
aVWell if you can do it in three weeks, so can a bunch of other people and that's a fact
p21759
aVSecondly, release of a commercial product would require having a license (count on a lawyer for this one), writing documentation, building a Website to promote the product, having some means of payment, getting a suitable legal structure to sell software, insurances (generally speaking you'd need some sort of professional indemnity--open source is generally provided without indemnity; commercial software is different), bookkeeping, accounting and so on
p21760
aVThird, it's PHP so source code protection will be an issue

p21762
aVMore to the point, don't hurt (or even inconvenience) your legitimate users for fear of pirates and thieves

aVIn general a HashMap works like this: it has a variable number of what are commonly called "buckets"
p22639
aVThe number of buckets can change over time (as entries are added and removed) but it is always a power of 2
p22640
aVLet's say a given  has 16 buckets
p22641
aVWhen you call put() to add an entry, the hashCode() of the key is calculated and then a mask is taken depending on the size of the buckets
p22642
aVIf you (bitwise) AND the hashCode() with 15 (0x0F) you will get the last 4 bits, equaling a number between 0 and 15 inclusive:
p22643
aVNow if there is already an entry in that bucket you have what's called a collision
p22644
aVThere are multiple ways of dealing with this but the one used by HashMap (and is probably the most common overall) is bucketing
p22645
aVAll the entries with the same masked hashCode are put in a list of some kind
p22646
aVSo to find if a given key is in the map already:
p22647
aVCalculate the masked hash code;
p22648
aVFind the appropriate bucket;
p22649
aVIf it's empty, key not found;
p22650
aVIf is isn't empty, loop through all entries in the bucket checking equals()
p22651
aVLooking through a bucket is a linear (O(n)) operation but it's on a small subset
p22652
aVThe hashcode bucket determination is essentially constant (O(1))
p22653
aVIf buckets are sufficiently small then access to a HashMap is usually described as "near O(1)"
p22654
aVYou can make a couple of observations about this
p22655
aVFirstly, if you have a bunch of objects that all return 42 as their hash code a  will still work but it will operate as an expensive list
p22656
aVAccess will be O(n) (as everything will be in the same bucket regardless of the number of buckets)
p22657
aVI've actually been asked this in an interview
p22658
aVSecondly, returning to your original point, if two objects are equal (meaning a

aVFirstly you need a submit button
p22766
aVThis should be the very first submit button in the form:
p22767
aVNow hide it:
p22768
aVAnd disable submit:
p22769
aVIf you want to cater for people who have Javascript disabled, check to see if there is a POST/GET (as appropriate) variable named "dummy" (as this only gets sent if that submit button is actually pressed)
p22770
aVIf you receive it just send the form back to the user as is
p22771
aVIn most cases it's probably not worth the effort of catering for those with Javascript disabled however
p22772
aVYou can alternatively only allow submission of the form if Javascript is enabled by messing with the action and other methods but (imho) this is perhaps too heavy handed

VThere are four things that spring to mind:
p22779
aVThe code is hard to read;
p22780
aVThere is no separation of presentation and processing logic;
p22781
aVOutputting HTML this way is probably my least preferred method; and
p22782
aVYour code is susceptible to SQL injection
p22783
aVHere are my suggestions
p22784
aVSplit your code into processing logic (called a "controller") and presentation (called a "view");
p22785
aVConstruct HTML elements with functions where it makes sense as this can be much easier to read; and
p22786
aVAlways treat user input as suspect for the purposes of defending against SQL injection and XSS (cross-site scripting) exploits; and
p22787
aVPut common code into an included file
p22788
aVFor example:
p22789
aVconfig
p22790
aVphp
p22791
aVpagename
p22792
aVphp
p22793
aVviewname
p22794
aVphp
p22795
aVThe logic in pagename
p22796
aVphp is a crude controller in the MVC (Model-View-Controlelr) sense
p22797
aVMVC is a common UI pattern
p22798
aVSome will argue you "need" a framework (CodeIgniteger, Kohana, Zend, CakePHP, Symfony, etc) but you don't
p22799
aVThey have various other benefits but the above is a simplistic (and often sufficient) split of the view and controller
p22800
aVThe view should largely just be a template that takes data given to it
p22801
aVThe above only has one view but you could easily branch in the controller to call multiple views
p22802
aVTemplate functions can really help on code readability
p22803
aVFor example:
p22804
aVThis can be called in your views/templates and will be much more readable
p22805
aVIf you have a function that has more than say 2-3 arguments pass in an array of options instead:

aVwith:
p22807
aVLastly, never accept user input like this:

aVAs you've correctly surmised a person can be one, both or neither

aVPartieis have two (or more) subtypes: Person and Organization are common;

p23099

p23100
aVIt would be quicker to work out what the maximum possible value is and you do that by adding up all the positive numbers in the grid
p23101
aVIf those numbers happen to form a valid sub-matrix (meaning you can create that set by removing rows and/or columns) then there's your answer
p23102
aVImplicit in this is that if none of the numbers are negative then the complete matrix is, by definition, the answer
p23103
aVAlso, knowing what the highest possible maximum is possibly allows you to shortcut the brute force evaluation since if you get any combination equal to that maximum then that is your answer and you can stop checking
p23104
aVAlso if all the numbers are non-positive, the answer is the maximum value as you can reduce the matrix to a 1 x 1 matrix with that 1 value in it, by definition
p23105
aVHere's an idea: construct 2n-1 n x m matrices where 1 <= m <= n
p23106
aVProcess them one after the other
p23107
aVFor each n x m matrix you can calculate:
p23108
aVThe highest possible maximum sum (as per above); and
p23109
aVWhether no numbers are positive allowing you to shortcut the answer
p23110
aVif (1) is below the currently calculate highest maximum sum then you can discard this n x m matrix
p23111
aVIf (2) is true then you just need a simple comparison to the current highest maximum sum
p23112
aVThis is generally referred to as a pruning technique

VTry:
p23195
aVWhat you're doing is trying to access the member variable  but you're doing it incorrectly so you're simply creating a new (local) variable to use
p23196
aVThat doesn't matter on open (the reference is simply discarded) but on close you're not dealing with a resource reference anymore
p23197
aVSecondly, your functions are static but your member variable isn't
p23198
aVThese are the two methods you use for accessing member variables:
p23199
aVEdit: regarding the last function, it works when you remove the call to  because it is no longer trying to access a database connection via the local variable  (which will cause an error)
p23200
aVNo it isn't good practice to close a database connection immediately
p23201
aVThe most common practice in PHP is simply to open a connection at the top of your script and then do nothing more
p23202
aVWhen the script exits it will close
p23203
aVSome people open connections on demand, meaning it won't try to create one until it needs one
p23204
aVThis is an acceptable optimization (from the point of view of not adding unnecessary complexity)
p23205
aVGenerally the connection will never be explicitly closed
p23206
aVIt will be closed implicitly when the script ends
p23207
aVLong-lived scripts may want to take a different approach just so they don't unnecessarily hold open connections for extended periods
p23208
aVYou may at some point want to use persistent connections instead
p23209
aVThe above method is simple enough and sufficient enough for some pretty large sites

p23326
aVImagine there are two circles:
p23327
aVC1 with center (x1,y1) and radius r1;
p23328
aVC2 with center (x2,y2) and radius r2
p23329
aVImagine there is a line running between those two center points
p23330
aVThe distance from the center points to the edge of either circle is, by definition, equal to their respective radii
p23331
aVSo:
p23332
aVif the edges of the circles touch, the distance between the centers is r1+r2;
p23333
aVany greater distance and the circles don't touch or collide; and
p23334
aVany less and then do collide
p23335
aVSo you can detect collision if:
p23336
aVmeaning the distance between the center points is less than the sum of the radii
p23337
aVThe same principle can be applied to detecting collisions between spheres in three dimensions
p23338
aVEdit: if you want to calculate the point of collision, some basic trigonometry can do that
p23339
aVYou have a triangle:
p23340
aVThe expressions  and  are absolute values
p23341
aVSo for the angle X:
p23342
aVOnce you have the angle you can calculate the point of intersection by applying them to a new triangle:
p23343
aVwhere:
p23344
aVso
p23345
aVFrom the previous formulae:
p23346
aVOnce you have a and b you can calculate the collision point in terms of (x2,y2) offset by (a,b) as appropriate
p23347
aVYou don't even need to calculate any sines, cosines or inverse sines or cosines for this
p23348
aVOr any square roots for that matter
p23349
aVSo it's fast
p23350
aVBut if you don't need an exact angle or point of collision and just want the octant you can optimize this further by understanding something about tangents, which is:
p23351
aV0 <= tan X <= 1 for 0 <= X <= 45 degrees;
p23352
aVtan X >= 1 for 45 <= X <= 90
p23353
aV0 >= tan X >= -1 for 0 >= X => -45;
p23354
aVtan X <= -1 for -45 >= X => -90; and
p23355
aVtan X = tan (X+180) = tan (X-180)
p23356
aVThose four degree ranges correspond to four octants of the cirlce
p23357
aVThe other four are offset by 180 degrees
p23358
aVAs demonstrated above, the tangent can be calculated simply as:
p23359
aVLose the absolute values and this ratio will tell you which of the four octants the collision is in (by the above tangent ranges)
p23360
aVTo work out the exact octant just compare x1 and x2 to determine which is leftmost
p23361
aVThe octant of the collision on the other single is offset (octant 1 on C1 means octant 5 on C2, 2 and 6, 3 and 7, 4 and 8, etc)

aVGoogle finds web pages
p23547
aVIf you want your classifieds to be found then they'll need to be on a Web page of some kind
p23548
aVYou can help this process by giving Google a site map/index of all your classifieds
p23549
aVI suggest you take a look at Google Basics and Creating and submitting SitemapsPrint
p23550
aVBasically the idea is to spoon feed Google every URL you want Google to find
p23551
aVSo if your reference your classifieds this way:
p23552
aVthen you create a list of every URL required to find every classified and yes this might be hundreds of thousands or even millions
p23553
aVThe above assumes a single classified per page
p23554
aVYou can of course put 5, 10, 50 or 100 on a single page and then create a smaller set of URLs for Google to crawl
p23555
aVWhatever you do however remember this: your sitemap should reflect how your site is used
p23556
aVEvery URL Google finds (or you give it) will appear in the index
p23557
aVSo don't give Google a URL that a user couldn't reach by using the site normally or that you don't want a user to use
p23558
aVSo while 50 classifieds per page might mean less requests from Google, if that's not how you want users to use your site (or a view you want to provide) then you'll have to do it some other way

aVWorking with dynamic table names in Hibernate (or any JPA provider) is extraordinarily difficult if not impractical (or even impossible)
p23569
aVThis question has come up before
p23570
aVSee JPA: How do I specify the table name corresponding to a class at runtime
p23571
aVWorking with dynamic data sources in Ibatis will require you to write some code but not all that much
p23572
aVBasically, Ibatis works around the concept of a , which has a data source and a list of queries that it can run
p23573
aVJust create one  for each database, each with a different data source, and have them include all the same query files (in the sql map config)

p23575
aVThis is the part you'll have to write yourself but it's straightforward
p23576

p23577

p23578
aVIt might still be possible but I'm not sure how Ibatis will react if you basically swap data sources at runtime from the
p23579
aVIt might work, it might blow up
p23580
aVYou'll have to try it and see

aVHibernate may work here too along the same principle: you inject multiple persistence units into a DAO and use the right one at runtime
p23582
aVWith Hibernate (or any JPA provider) you will have to watch out for making sure your managed objects are stored in the correct persistence unit
p23583
aVI can easily see this turning into a nightmare actually

VLots of languages will do this just fine, including Java
p23739
aVYou're familiar with that so my advice is stick to it with one caveat: depending on your requirements I would seriously suggest examining the possibility of making it a Web app instead

aVDesktop database apps are somewhat

aVold-fashioned
p23742
aVMore to the point they'll create a bunch of headaches for you such as installation, Swing is annoying and tedious, etc
p23743
aVAs for what database, barring requirements you haven't specified, anything will do so pick something free like MySQL
p23744
aVSo for a desktop Java app I would:
p23745
aVPut the database on a remote server;
p23746
aVPut an application server or Web container on that same server;
p23747
aVCreate a Webapp on the app server for handling RPC;
p23748
aVPick a method of RPC, be it Web services or whatever, and use Spring to implement it;
p23749
aVCreate a desktop Java app in Swing and distribute it to clients from the app server via Webstart (JNLP)
p23750
aVIf it's a Web app:
p23751
aVPut the database and appserver or Web container on one server;
p23752
aVPick a Java Web framework and create a bunch of Web pages that do what you want
p23753
aVIn all cases, have it be the same app but just act differently on the user type
p23754
aVThis is much better than maintaining three different apps
p23755
aVAlso if you do a Web app, you might want to consider using PHP as it's a fast and proven way of knocking up Web pages and probably sufficient for the kind of internal application that you're doing

VWell the first thing you have to realize is the OOAD ("Object-oriented analysis and design") is a tool and not a means to an end
p23909
aVWhat you get out of that process is a model, not a true representation of what you're modelling
p23910
aVThat model makes certain assumptions
p23911
aVThe purpose of that model is to solve a problem you have
p23912

aVHow do you know if you've done it right
p23914
aVBy the end result: has it solved your problem
p23915
aVSo, for the Car example, in some models a car count could simply be an integer count, for example the car traffic through an intersection in a traffic model
p23916
aVIn such a model rarely do you care about the make, model or construction of cars, just the number
p23917
aVYou might care about the type of vehicle to the point of is it a truck or car (for example)
p23918
aVDo you model that as a Vehicle object with a type of Car or Truck
p23919
aVOr just separate carCount and truckCount tallies
p23920
aVThe short answer is: whichever works best
p23921
aVThe normal test for something being an object or not is does it have behaviour
p23922
aVRemember that ultimately objects = data + behaviour
p23923
aVSo you might say that cars have the following state:
p23924
aV# of wheels;
p23925
aVHeight of suspension;
p23926
aVLeft or right drive;
p23927
aVColour;

aV# of doors;

p23934
aVWhether it has a stereo, CD player, MP3 player and/or satnav;
p23935
aVSize of the petrol tank;
p23936
aVNumber of cylinders;
p23937
aV# of turbo charges and/or fuel injection;
p23938
aVMaximum torque;
p23939
aVMaximum brake-horsepower;
p23940
aVand so on
p23941
aVChances are you'll only care about a small subset of that: pick whatever is relevant
p23942
aVA racing game might go into more detail about the wheels, such as how hot they are, how worn, the width and tread type and so on
p23943
aVIn such a case, a Wheel object could be said to be a collection of all that state (but little behaviour) because a Car has a number of Wheels and the Wheels are interchangeable
p23944
aVSo that brings up the second point about objects: an object can exist because of a relationship such that the object represents a complete set of data
p23945
aVSo a Wheel could have tread, width, temperature and so on
p23946
aVYou can't divide that up and say a Car has tread but no wheel width so it makes sense for Wheel to be an object since a Wheel in it's entirety is interchangeable

VSeveral reasons:
p24127
aVConceptually questions and answers aren't really that different from a modelling perspective;
p24128
aVIt makes it easier to search (one table rather than two);
p24129
aVIf you've ever tried to implement such a system across two tables (and this includes forums where you have posts that start threads and replies) you'll quickly discover the SQL gets really awkward really fast
p24130
aVThe best way to look at this problem is to run a particular model through some use cases
p24131
aVFor example: list all posts by a user in some order (votes, date, etc)
p24132
aVAcross two tables you end up doing some kind of UNION, which is not really undesirable
p24133
aVIf they're stored in the same table it's much easier
p24134
aVIf you just want to limit it to questions or answers then the same table is still easy as it's just an extra criteria (eg WHERE parentID IS NULL for questions)

VSpecial Case: Hashing and Equality
p24160
aVFirstly, we need to determine something about the assumptions, namely the existence of an equals and has function relationship
p24161
aVWhat do I mean by this
p24162
aVI mean that for the set of source objects S, given any two objects x1 and x2 that are elements of S there exists a (hash) function F such that:
p24163
aVJava has such a relationship
p24164
aVThat allows you to check to duplicates as a near O(1) operation and thus reduces the algorithm to a simple O(n) problem
p24165
aVIf order is unimportant, it's a simple one liner:
p24166
aVIf order is important:
p24167
aVYou will note that I said "near O(1)"
p24168
aVThat's because such data structures (as a Java HashMap or HashSet) rely on a method where a portion of the hash code is used to find an element (often called a bucket) in the backing storage
p24169
aVThe number of buckets is a power-of-2
p24170
aVThat way the index into that list is easy to calculate
p24171
aVhashCode() returns an int
p24172
aVIf you have 16 buckets you can find which one to use by ANDing the hashCode with 15, giving you a number from 0 to 15
p24173
aVWhen you try and put something in that bucket it may already be occupied
p24174
aVIf so then a linear comparison of all entries in that bucket will occur
p24175
aVIf the collision rate gets too high or you try to put too many elements in the structure will be grown, typically doubled (but always by a power-of-2) and all the items are placed in their new buckets (based on the new mask)
p24176
aVThus resizing such structures is relatively expensive
p24177
aVLookup may also be expensive
p24178
aVConsider this class:
p24179
aVThis code is perfectly legal and it fulfills the equals-hashCode contract
p24180
aVAssuming your set contains nothing but A instances, your insertion/search now turns into an O(n) operation, turning the entire insertion into O(n2)
p24181
aVObviously this is an extreme example but it's useful to point out that such mechanisms also rely on a relatively good distribution of hashes within the value space the map or set uses
p24182
aVFinally, it must be said that this is a special case
p24183
aVIf you're using a language without this kind of "hashing shortcut" then it's a different story
p24184
aVGeneral Case: No Ordering
p24185
aVIf no ordering function exists for the list then you're stuck with an O(n2) brute-force comparison of every object to every other object
p24186
aVSo in Java:
p24187
aVGeneral Case: Ordering
p24188
aVIf an ordering function exists (as it does with, say, a list of integers or strings) then you sort the list (which is O(n log n)) and then compare each element in the list to the next (O(n)) so the total algorithm is O(n log n)

aVWhat you normally have to watch out for is trying to do too many simultaneous Ajax requests as browsers have (typically fairly low) limits on the number of requests to one domain (eg IE, at least certain versions, has a limit of 2)
p24410

VGenerics and arrays don't mix, basically
p24488
aVThe short answer is that you can work around this problem
p24489
aVThe longer answer is that you probably shouldn't and I'll explain why
p24490
aVYou could use  like this:
p24491
aVbut you can't create an array of your parameterized type
p24492
aVArrays are covariant
p24493
aVThat means they retain the type of their elements at runtime
p24494
aVJava's generics are not
p24495
aVThey use type erasure to basically mask the implicit casting that is going on
p24496
aVIt's important to understand that
p24497
aVSo when you create an Object array you can't cast it to, say, a Comparable array (or any other type) because that is not correct
p24498
aVTo give you an example
p24499
aVWith generics this is perfectly legal:
p24500
aVIt's also why you can't do this:
p24501
aVie at runtime there is no knowledge of T's class
p24502
aVThis is why the above code is more often written as:
p24503
aVbecause their is no runtime type for the generic argument
p24504
aVBut with arrays:
p24505
aVWhat you should be doing in this case (imho) is not using arrays but using an
p24506
aVIn all honesty, there is very little reason to use arrays over an  and generics is just one example of that
p24507
aVFor a better and more complete explanation see the (excellent) Java Generics FAQ:
p24508
aVCan I create an array whose component type is a concrete parameterized type
p24509
aVNo, because it is not type-safe

VWell, firstly, if you want to support IE6 you're going to need Javascript of some description because that browser only supports the  pseudo-element on anchors (links ie  tags)
p24524
aVThe other problem is you will need the child CSS selector to do this, which again isn't supported in IE6
p24525
aVSo a non-IE6 compatible version is:
p24526
aVNote the  element that is implicitly created
p24527
aVWithout the child (>) selector this expression:
p24528
aVwill grab every indent cell because that is known as a descendant selector and the top-level content table is parent to all of them
p24529
aVYou could work around that problem this way:
p24530
aVThe second one basically cancels out that problem by reverting the deeper indents to whatever the normal formatting should be
p24531
aVIt's a fairly standard technique to dealing with some IE6 issues that could be solved with a child selector but it's not always possible or practical to revert styles this way

p24691
aVIf you read through this I've determined that the only way to store a complete game state is by storing a complete list of moves
p24692
aVRead on for why
p24693
aVSo I use a slightly simplified version of the problem for piece layout
p24694
aVThe Problem
p24695
aVThis image illustrates the starting Chess position
p24696
aVChess occurs on an 8x8 board with each player starting with an identical set of 16 pieces consisting of 8 pawns, 2 rooks, 2 knights, 2 bishops, 1 queen and 1 king as illustrated here:
p24697
aVPositions are generally recorded as a letter for the column followed by the number for the row so White\u2019s queen is at d1
p24698
aVMoves are most often stored in algebraic notation, which is unambiguous and generally only specifies the minimal information necessary
p24699
aVConsider this opening:
p24700
aVe4 e5
p24701
aVNf3 Nc6
p24702
aV\u2026
p24703
aVwhich translates to:
p24704
aVWhite moves king\u2019s pawn from e2 to e4 (it is the only piece that can get to e4 hence \u201ce4\u201d);
p24705
aVBlack moves the king\u2019s pawn from e7 to e5;
p24706
aVWhite moves the knight (N) to f3;
p24707
aVBlack moves the knight to c6
p24708
aVThe board looks like this:
p24709
aVAn important ability for any programmer is to be able to correctly and unambiguously specify the problem
p24710
aVSo what\u2019s missing or ambiguous
p24711
aVA lot as it turns out
p24712
aVBoard State vs Game State
p24713
aVThe first thing you need to determine is whether you\u2019re storing the state of a game or the position of pieces on the board
p24714
aVEncoding simply the positions of the pieces is one thing but the problem says \u201call subsequent legal moves\u201d
p24715
aVThe problem also says nothing about knowing the moves up to this point
p24716
aVThat\u2019s actually a problem as I\u2019ll explain
p24717
aVCastling
p24718
aVThe game has proceeded as follows:
p24719
aVe4 e5
p24720
aVNf3 Nc6
p24721
aVBb5 a6
p24722
aVBa4 Bc5
p24723
aVThe board looks as follows:
p24724
aVWhite has the option of castling
p24725
aVPart of the requirements for this are that the king and the relevant rook can never have moved, so whether the king or either rook of each side has moved will need to be stored
p24726
aVObviously if they aren\u2019t on their starting positions, they have moved otherwise it needs to be specified
p24727
aVThere are several strategies that can be used for dealing with this problem
p24728
aVFirstly, we could store an extra 6 bits of information (1 for each rook and knight position) to indicate whether that piece had moved
p24729
aVWe could streamline this by only storing a bit for one of these six squares if the right piece happens to be in it
p24730
aVAlternatively we could treat each unmoved piece as another piece type so instead of 6 piece types on each side (pawn, rook, knight, bishop, queen and king) there are 8 (adding unmoved rook and unmoved king)
p24731
aVEn Passant
p24732
aVAnother peculiar and often-neglected rule in Chess is En Passant
p24733
aVThe game has progressed
p24734
aVe4 e5
p24735
aVNf3 Nc6
p24736
aVBb5 a6
p24737
aVBa4 Bc5
p24738
aVO-O b5
p24739
aVBb3 b4
p24740
aVc4
p24741
aVBlack\u2019s pawn on b4 now has the option of moving his pawn on b4 to c3 taking the White pawn on c4
p24742
aVThis only happens on the first opportunity meaning if Black passes on the option now he can\u2019t take it next move
p24743
aVSo we need to store this
p24744
aVIf we know the previous move we can definitely answer if En Passant is possible
p24745
aVAlternatively we can store whether each pawn on its 4th rank has just moved there with a double move forward
p24746
aVOr we can look at each possible En Passant position on the board and have a flag to indicate whether its possible or not
p24747
aVPromotion
p24748
aVIt is White\u2019s move
p24749
aVIf White moves his pawn on h7 to h8 it can be promoted to any other piece (but not the king)
p24750
aV99% of the time it is promoted to a Queen but sometimes it isn\u2019t, typically because that may force a stalemate when otherwise you\u2019d win
p24751
aVThis is written as:
p24752
aVThis is important in our problem because it means we can\u2019t count on there being a fixed number of pieces on each side
p24753
aVIt is entirely possible (but incredibly unlikely) for one side to end up with 9 queens, 10 rooks, 10 bishops or 10 knights if all 8 pawns get promoted
p24754
aVStalemate
p24755
aVWhen in a position from which you cannot win your best tactic is to try for a stalemate
p24756
aVThe most likely variant is where you cannot make a legal move (usually because any move when put your king in check)
p24757
aVIn this case you can claim a draw
p24758
aVThis one is easy to cater for
p24759
aVThe second variant is by threefold repetition
p24760
aVIf the same board position occurs three times in a game (or will occur a third time on the next move), a draw can be claimed
p24761
aVThe positions need not occur in any particular order (meaning it doesn\u2019t have to the same sequence of moves repeated three times)
p24762
aVThis one greatly complicates the problem because you have to remember every previous board position
p24763
aVIf this is a requirement of the problem the only possible solution to the problem is to store every previous move
p24764
aVLastly, there is the fifty move rule
p24765
aVA player can claim a draw if no pawn has moved and no piece has been taken in the previous fifty consecutive moves so we would need to store how many moves since a pawn was moved or a piece taken (the latest of the two
p24766
aVThis requires 6 bits (0-63)
p24767
aVWhose Turn Is It
p24768
aVOf course we also need to know whose turn it is and this is a single bit of information
p24769
aVTwo Problems
p24770
aVBecause of the stalemate case, the only feasible or sensible way to store the game state is to store all the moves that led to this position
p24771
aVI\u2019ll tackle that one problem
p24772
aVThe board state problem will be simplified to this: store the current position of all pieces on the board ignoring castling, en passant, stalemate conditions and whose turn it is
p24773
aVPiece layout can be broadly handled in one of two ways: by storing the contents of each square or by storing the position of each piece
p24774
aVSimple Contents
p24775
aVThere are six piece types (pawn, rook, knight, bishop, queen and king)
p24776
aVEach piece can be White or Black so a square may contain one of 12 possible pieces or it may be empty so there are 13 possibilities
p24777
aV13 can be stored in 4 bits (0-15) So the simplest solution is to store 4 bits for each square times 64 squares or 256 bits of information
p24778
aVThe advantage of this method is that manipulation is incredibly easy and fast
p24779
aVThis could even be extended by adding 3 more possibilities without increasing the storage requirements: a pawn that has moved 2 spaces on the last turn, a king that hasn\u2019t moved and a rook that hasn\u2019t moved, which will cater for a lot of previously mentioned issues
p24780
aVBut we can do better
p24781
aVBase 13 Encoding
p24782
aVIt is often helpful to think of the board position as a very large number
p24783
aVThis is often done in computer science
p24784
aVFor example, the halting problem treats a computer program (rightly) as a large number
p24785
aVThe first solution treats the position as a 64 digit base 16 number but as demonstrated there is redundancy in this information (being the 3 unused possibilities per \u201cdigit\u201d) so we can reduce the number space to 64 base 13 digits
p24786
aVOf course this can\u2019t be done as efficiently as base 16 can but it will save on storage requirements (and minimizing storage space is our goal)
p24787
aVIn base 10 the number 234 is equivalent to 2 x 102 + 3 x 101 + 4 x 100
p24788
aVIn base 16 the number 0xA50 is equivalent to 10 x 162 + 5 x 161 + 0 x 160 = 2640 (decimal)
p24789
aVSo we can encode our position as p0 x 1363 + p1 x 1362 +
p24790
aV+ p63 x 130 where pi represents the contents of square i
p24791
aV2256 equals approximately 1
p24792
aV16e77
p24793
aV1364 equals approximately 1
p24794
aV96e71, which requires 237 bits of storage space
p24795
aVThat saving of a mere 7
p24796
aV5% comes at a cost of significantly increased manipulation costs
p24797
aVVariable Base Encoding
p24798
aVIn legal boards certain pieces can\u2019t appear in certain squares
p24799
aVFor example, pawns cannot occur at in the first or eighth ranks, reducing the possibilities for those squares to 11
p24800
aVThat reduces the possible boards to 1116 x 1348 = 1
p24801
aV35e70 (approximately), requiring 233 bits of storage space
p24802
aVActually encoding and decoding such values to and from decimal (or binary) is a little more convoluted but it can be done reliably and is left as an exercise to the reader
p24803
aVVariable Width Alphabets
p24804
aVThe previous two methods can both be described as fixed-width alphabetic encoding
p24805
aVEach of the 11, 13 or 16 members of the alphabet is substituted for another value
p24806
aVEach \u201ccharacter\u201d is the same width but the efficiency can be improved when you consider that each character is not equally likely
p24807
aVConsider Morse code (pictured above)
p24808
aVCharacters in a message are encoded as a sequence of dashes and dots
p24809
aVThose dashes and dots are transferred over radio (typically) with a pause between them to delimit them
p24810
aVNotice how the letter E (the most common letter in English) is a single dot, the shortest possible sequence, whereas Z (the least frequent) is two dashes and two beeps
p24811
aVSuch a scheme can significantly reduce the size of an expected message but comes at the cost of increasing the size of a random character sequence
p24812
aVIt should be noted that Morse code has another inbuilt feature: dashes are as long as three dots so the above code is created with this in mind to minimize the use of dashes
p24813
aVSince 1s and 0s (our building blocks) don\u2019t have this problem, it\u2019s not a feature we need to replicate
p24814
aVLastly, there are two kinds of rests in Morse code
p24815
aVA short rest (the length of a dot) is used to distinguish between dots and dashes
p24816
aVA longer gap (the length of a dash) is used to delimit characters
p24817
aVSo how does this apply to our problem
p24818
aVHuffman Coding
p24819
aVThere is an algorithm for dealing with variable length codes called Huffman coding
p24820
aVHuffman coding creates a variable length code substitution, typically uses expected frequency of the symbols to assign shorter values to the more common symbols
p24821
aVIn the above tree, the letter E is encoded as 000 (or left-left-left) and S is 1011
p24822
aVIt should be clear that this encoding scheme is unambiguous
p24823
aVThis is an important distinction from Morse code
p24824
aVMorse code has the character separator so it can do otherwise ambiguous substitution (eg 4 dots can be H or 2 Is) but we only have 1s and 0s so we choose an unambiguous substitution instead
p24825
aVBelow is a simple implementation:
p24826
aVwith static data:
p24827
aVand:
p24828
aVOne possible output is:
p24829
aVFor a starting position this equates to 32 x 1 + 16 x 3 + 12 x 5 + 4 x 6 = 164 bits
p24830
aVState Difference
p24831
aVAnother possible approach is to combine the very first approach with Huffman coding
p24832
aVThis is based on the assumption that most expected Chess boards (rather than randomly generated ones) are more likely than not to, at least in part, resemble a starting position
p24833
aVSo what you do is XOR the 256 bit current board position with a 256 bit starting position and then encode that (using Huffman coding or, say, some method of run length encoding)
p24834
aVObviously this will be very efficient to start with (64 0s probably corresponding to 64 bits) but increase in storage required as the game progresses
p24835
aVPiece Position
p24836
aVAs mentioned, another way of attacking this problem is to instead store the position of each piece a player has
p24837
aVThis works particularly well with endgame positions where most squares will be empty (but in the Huffman coding approach empty squares only use 1 bit anyway)
p24838
aVEach side will have a king and 0-15 other pieces
p24839
aVBecause of promotion the exact make up of those pieces can vary enough that you can\u2019t assume the numbers based on the starting positions are maxima
p24840
aVThe logical way to divide this up is store a Position consisting of two Sides (White and Black)
p24841
aVEach Side has:
p24842
aVA king: 6 bits for the location;
p24843
aVHas pawns: 1 (yes), 0 (no);
p24844
aVIf yes, number of pawns: 3 bits (0-7+1 = 1-8);
p24845
aVIf yes, the location of each pawn is encoded: 45 bits (see below);
p24846
aVNumber of non-pawns: 4 bits (0-15);
p24847
aVFor each piece: type (2 bits for queen, rook, knight, bishop) and location (6 bits)
p24848
aVAs for the pawn location, the pawns can only be on 48 possible squares (not 64 like the others)
p24849
aVAs such, it is better not to waste the extra 16 values that using 6 bits per pawn would use
p24850
aVSo if you have 8 pawns there are 488 possibilities, equalling 28,179,280,429,056
p24851
aVYou need 45 bits to encode that many values
p24852
aVThat\u2019s 105 bits per side or 210 bits total
p24853
aVThe starting position is the worst case for this method however and it will get substantially better as you remove pieces
p24854
aVIt should be pointed out that there are less than 488 possibilities because the pawns can\u2019t all be in the same square  The first has 48 possibilities, the second 47 and so on
p24855
aV48 x 47 x \u2026 x 41 = 1
p24856
aV52e13 = 44 bits storage
p24857
aVYou can further improve this by eliminating the squares that are occupied by other pieces (including the other side) so you could first place the white non-pawns then the black non-pawns, then the white pawns and lastly the black pawns
p24858
aVOn a starting position this reduces the storage requirements to 44 bits for White and 42 bits for Black
p24859
aVCombined Approaches
p24860
aVAnother possible optimization is that each of these approaches has its strength and weaknesses
p24861
aVYou could, say, pick the best 4 and then encode a scheme selector in the first two bits and then the scheme-specific storage after that
p24862
aVWith the overhead that small, this will by far be the best approach
p24863
aVGame State
p24864
aVI return to the problem of storing a game rather than a position
p24865
aVBecause of the threefold repetition we have to store the list of moves that have occurred to this point
p24866
aVAnnotations
p24867
aVOne thing you have to determine is are you simply storing a list of moves or are you annotating the game
p24868
aVChess games are often annotated, for example:
p24869
aVWhite\u2019s move is marked by two exclamation points as brilliant whereas Black\u2019s is viewed as a mistake
p24870
aVSee Chess punctuation
p24871
aVAdditionally you could also need to store free text as the moves are described
p24872
aVI am assuming that the moves are sufficient so there will be no annotations
p24873
aVAlgebraic Notation
p24874
aVWe could simply store the the text of the move here (\u201ce4\u201d, \u201cBxb5\u201d, etc)
p24875
aVIncluding a terminating byte you\u2019re looking at about 6 bytes (48 bits) per move (worst case)
p24876
aVThat\u2019s not particularly efficient
p24877
aVThe second thing to try is to store the starting location (6 bits) and end location (6 bits) so 12 bits per move
p24878
aVThat is significantly better
p24879
aVAlternatively we can determine all the legal moves from the current position in a predictable and deterministic way and state which we\u2019ve chosen
p24880
aVThis then goes back to the variable base encoding mentioned above
p24881
aVWhite and Black have 14 possible moves each on their first move, more on the second and so on
p24882
aVConclusion
p24883
aVThere is no absolutely right answer to this question
p24884
aVThere are many possible approaches of which the above are just a few
p24885
aVWhat I like about this and similar problems is that it demands abilities important to any programmer like considering the usage pattern, accurately determining requirements and thinking about corner cases

p24918
aVSo stick with what you're familiar with
p24919
aVThe answer to your question is: they are both fast enough
p24920
aVAny such comparison is hard because you end up doing things differently in different languages
p24921
aVJava bytecode is probably faster to interpret but then again any decent PHP install uses as opcode cache largely negating any such advantage in real terms
p24922
aVJava also has a more complicated development model because Web processes are persistent
p24923
aVThis can have a performance advantage but also can create problems like memory and other resource leakage, which PHP doesn't tend to have because everything is created and destroyed on each request (barring session information, memcache and so on)

aVI've got experience doing both Java and PHP development

aVquicker to test changes in development (ie no build/deploy steps and Java hot-deploy has serious limitations)
p24931

aVfar fewer issues of memory/resource leakage;
p24933
aVextensive library of functions to do pretty much anything you want;
p24934
aVcheaper to host (at the low end)
p24935
aVI will use Java for some things, like anything that involves a lot of background processing and threading, which aren't PHP's strong points

VThe issue here is subtyping
p25011
aVThere are three basic approaches to dealing with subtypes
p25012
aVPut each record type into a completely separate table;
p25013
aVPut a record in a parent table and then a record in a subtype table; and
p25014
aVPut all the records in one table, having nullable columns for the "optional" data (ie things that don't apply to that type)
p25015
aVEach strategy has its merits
p25016
aVFor example, (3) is particularly applicable if there is little to no difference between different subtypes
p25017
aVIn your case, do different log records have extra columns if they're of a particular type
p25018
aVIf they don't or there are few cases when they do putting them all in one table makes perfect sense
p25019
aV(2) is common used for a Party table
p25020
aVThis is a common model in CRMs that involves a parent Party object which has subtypes for Person and Organization (Organization may also have subtypes like Company, Association, etc)
p25021
aVPerson and Organization have different properties (eg salutation, given names, date of birth, etc for Person) so it makes sense to split this up rather than using nullable columns
p25022
aV(2) is potentially more space efficient (although the overhead of NULL columns in modern DBMSs is very low)
p25023
aVThe bigger issue is that (2) might be more confusing to developers
p25024
aVYou will get a situation where someone needs to store an extra field somewhere and will whack it in a column that's empty for that type simply because it's easier doing that than getting approval for the DBAs to add a column (no, I'm not kidding)
p25025
aV(1) is probably the least frequently used scheme of the 3 in my experience
p25026
aVLastly, scalability has to be considered and is probably the best case for (1)
p25027
aVAt a certain points JOINs don't scale effectively and you'll need to use some kind of partitioning scheme to cut down your table sizes
p25028
aV(1) is one method of doing that (but a crude method)
p25029
aVI wouldn't worry too much about that though
p25030
aVYou'll typically need to get to hundreds of millions or billions of records before that becomes an issue (unless your records are really really large, in which case it'll happen sooner)

VMy advice on data modeling is:
p25129
aVYou should favour optional (nullable) columns over 1:1 joins generally speaking
p25130
aVThere are still instances where 1:1 makes sense, usually revolving around subtyping
p25131
aVPeople tend to be more squeamish when it comes to nullable columns than they do about joins oddly;
p25132
aVDon't make a model too indirect unless really justified (more on this below);
p25133
aVFavour joins over aggregation
p25134
aVThis can vary so it needs to be tested
p25135
aVSee Oracle vs MySQL vs SQL Server: Aggregation vs Joins for an example of this;
p25136
aVJoins are better than N+1 selects
p25137
aVAn N+1 select is, for example, selecting an order from a database table and then issuing a separate query to get all the line items for that order;
p25138
aVThe scalability of joins is usually only an issue when you're doing mass selects
p25139
aVIf you select a single row and then join that to a few things rarely is this a problem (but sometimes it is);
p25140
aVForeign keys should always be indexed unless you're dealing with a trivially small table;
p25141
aVMore in Database Development Mistakes Made by AppDevelopers
p25142
aVNow as for directness of a model, let me give you an example
p25143
aVLet's say you're designing a system for authentication and authorization of users
p25144
aVAn overengineered solution might look something like this:
p25145
aVAlias (id, username, user_id);
p25146
aVUser (id,
p25147
ag2539
aVEmail (id, user_id, email address);
p25148
aVLogin (id, user_id,
p25149
aVLogin Roles (id, login_id, role_id);
p25150
aVRole (id, name);
p25151
aVRole Privilege (id, role_id, privilege_id);
p25152
aVPrivilege (id, name)
p25153
aVSo you need 6 joins to get from the username entered to the actual privileges
p25154
aVSure there might be an actual requirement for this but more often than not this kind of system is put in because of the hand-wringing by some developer thinking they might someday need it even though every user only has one alias, user to login is 1:1 and so on
p25155
aVA simpler solution is:
p25156
aVUser (id, username, email address, user type)
p25157
aVand, well, that's it
p25158
aVPerhaps if you need a complex role system but it's also quite possible that you don't and if you do it's reasonably easy to slot in (user type becomes a foreign key into a user types or roles table) or it's generally straightforward to map the old to the new
p25159
aVThis is thing about complexity: it's easy to add and hard to remove
p25160
aVUsually it's a constant vigil against unintended complexity, which is bad enough without going and making it worse by adding unnecessary complexity

p25196
aVVideo, Picture, Album, etc are child entities of Content;
p25197
aVComment has a foreign key of Content ID
p25198
aVThere are three basic schemes for implementing subtyping:
p25199
aVCreate a separate table for each subtype;
p25200
aVCreate a table called Content with subordinate tables Video, Album, etc with a foreign key of Conent ID
p25201
aVThe Content table also has a Content Type field to indicate what table relates to that record; or
p25202
aVPut everything into a table called Content that has a bunch of optional (nullable) columns to cover the subtypes
p25203
aVThis is most appropriate when there is little to no difference in the columns required to store subtype-specific information
p25204
aVIf you relate Comment back to a table of Video or Album you have what's called an exclusive arc
p25205
aVThis isn't recommended practice for data modelling
p25206
aVEdit: for example:
p25207

p25395
aVJava 5 and earlier have all been end-of-lifed
p25396
aVWhat's a little confusing is that starting at version 1
p25397

p25399
aV4 (or more simply Java 1
p25400
aV4)
p25401
aVVersion 1
p25402
aV5 became Java 5 or J5SE although J2SE is still pretty common
p25403
aVThe other version of Java that's relevant is Java Enterprise Edition ("Java EE"), formerly J2EE ("Java 2 Enterprise Edition") with version 6 being imminent
p25404
aVJava EE specifies a set of standards for server apps
p25405
aVThe most important part is the servlets specification, which is the basis for 99
p25406
aV9% of Java Web frameworks
p25407
aVIt has versions and is currently at either version 2
p25408
aV5 or 2
p25409
aV6 (I forget)
p25410
aVApache Tomcat is the reference implementation of the servlets specification
p25411
aVAnother part is EJB ("Enterprise Java Beans") currently at EJB3/3
p25412
ag2257
aVIt's a component architecture and really heavyweight
p25413
aVIt's not used anywhere near as often as the base servlets specification
p25414
aVWhereas Tomcat is a Web container, full Java EE supports is provided by what's called an application server
p25415
aVExamples include Glassfish, JBoss, Weblogic and Websphere
p25416
aVJava classes are often packaged as JARs ("Java ARchives"), which is simply a zipped file with a specified directory structure
p25417
aVWeb applications are packaged as wars ("Web ARchive"), which is just a jar with a different extension
p25418
aVWARs may contain libraries in JAR form
p25419
aVFull Java EE apps are packaged into EARs ("Enterprise ARchives"), which again is just a different file extension and it may contain war and other files

p25668
aVshutdown() tells the threadpool that no more jobs can be submitted (it'll throw an exception if you try) and it means that the awaitTermination() will run until all the jobs finish (at what point the thread pool will shut down)
p25669
aVThe shutdown() is basically what awaitTermination() is waiting for
p25670
aVIt's a way of making the thing block until all work is done
p25671
aVThere are other ways to do this (eg a CountdownLatch) but this way is pretty good
p25672
aVAs for whether you need to synchronize your List or not, well that depends on what you're doing with it
p25673
aVPerhaps I should give you a framework for how to do this in a generic sense
p25674
aVNot 100% sure this will work as is as I've just written it off the top of my head but the principles are sound
p25675
aVYou can then do:
p25676
aVIt's about the best you can do in Java without closures or delegates
p25677
aVHow it works:
p25678
aVIt creates an intermediate list of Futures;
p25679
aVFutures are the result of an operation
p25680
aVIf the operation hasn't completed yet, calling Future
p25681
aVget() will block until it does return, otherwise it returns the result immediately;
p25682
aVEach item of the list is passed in to the function passed in and mapped to a new value
p25683
aVThis way the mapped operation doesn't need to be aware of any threading;
p25684
aVThe thread pool is shutdown
p25685
aVNo more submissions are allowed;
p25686
aVThe awaitTermination() will block until the last thread finishes executing
p25687
aVThe above can be adapted to be synchronous too, which is useful because your functions are thread-agnostic
p25688
aVEdit: as noted, technically you can get away without the awaitTermination(), instead simply doing a Future
p25689
aVget() since that will block but that method isn't as clean and may hide thread pool errors
p25690
aVBasically, shutdown/awaiTermination is just better
p25691
aVAlos if you get an exception on Future
p25692
aVget() you'll need to make sure you shutdown the thread pool in a finally block anyway

aVA reversible encrypted (and base64 doesn't really count as encryption) primary key is still a primary key
p25959
aVWhat you were reading comes down to this: you generally don't want to have your primary keys have any kind of meaning outside the system
p25960
aVThis is called a technical primary key rather than a natural primary key
p25961
aVThat's why you might use an auto number field for Patient ID rather than SSN (which is called a natural primary key)
p25962
aVTechnical primary keys are generally favoured over natural primary keys because things that seem constant do change and this can cause problems

aVIf you do have technical primary keys you don't want to make them de facto natural primary keys by giving them meaning they didn't otherwise have

aVand Supercharging Javascript in PHP
p26969
aVThe short answer is that you want to minimize external HTTP requests
p26970
aVThe best way to do that is to force the browser to cache files you server until they change
p26971
aVYou do this by versioning the files and providing a far future Expires header

aVWhen the filename changes (by changing the version) the browser will get the new version
p26973
aVIf you do this then multiple Javascript files don't really matter
p26974
aVBut if you force the client to download 27 JS files on each and every page with no caching then reducing the number of files can make a substantial difference
p26975

aVEither allow their applications to scale vertically or horizontally
p27601
aVHorizontal scaling is about doing things in parallel
p27602
aVVertical scaling is about doing things faster
p27603
aVThis typically means more powerful hardware
p27604
aVOften when people talk about horizontal scalability the ideal is to have (near-)linear scalability
p27605
aVThis means that if one $5k production box can handle 2,000 concurrent users then adding 4 more should handle 10,000 concurrent users
p27606
aVThe closer it is to that figure the better
p27607
aVThe ideal for highly scalable apps is to have near-limitless near-linear horizontal scalability such that you can just plug in another box and your capacity increases by an expected amount with little or no diminishing returns
p27608
aVIdeally redundancy is part of the equation too but that's typically a separate issue
p27609
aVThe poster child for this kind of scalability is, of course, Google
p27610
aVWhat are the factors that are looked after by developers during scaling
p27611
aVHow much scale should be planned for
p27612
aVThere's no point spending time and money on a problem you'll never have;
p27613
aVIs it possible and/or economical to scale vertically
p27614
aVThis is the preferred option as it is typically much, much cheaper (in the short term);
p27615
aVIs it worth the (often significant) cost to enable your application to scale horizontally
p27616
aVDistributed/multithreaded apps are significantly more difficult and expensive to write
p27617
aVAny tips and tricks about scaling web applications
p27618
aVYes:
p27619
aVDon't worry about problems you'll never have;
p27620
aVDon't worry much about problems you're unlikely to have
p27621
aVChances are things will have changed long before you have them;
p27622
aVDon't be afraid to throw away code and start again
p27623
aVHaving automated tests makes this far easier; and
p27624
aVThink in terms of developer time being expensive
p27625
aV(4) is a key point
p27626
aVYou might have a poorly written app that will require $20,000 of hardware to essentially fix

aVServlets are just the most convenient way to write a Web application in Java
p27701
aVIf you think about it: what is a Web application
p27702
aVQuite simply it is an application that can receive an HTTP request and send back an HTTP response
p27703
aVCommon models for achieving this are:
p27704
aVTo use some kind of wrapper that invokes a script for each request
p27705
aVThis was the first model and has a standard called CGI (Common Gateway Interface)
p27706
aVThe wrapper in this case is a Web server; or
p27707
aVTo have persistent code within such a wrapper that can service HTTP requests (rather than being transient like CGI scripts)
p27708
aVThere are variations upon this theme (eg FastCGI for (1))
p27709
aVServlets are an example of (2)
p27710
aVThe reason 99% of all Java Web applications and frameworks use servlets is because servlets are standard (they have a specification endorsed by Sun and a reference implementation) and they're so low-level that pretty much whatever you want can be built on top of them

p27984
aVThere are vendor-specific extensions that do that but native JPA doesn't cater for it
p27985
aVIn part this is because JPA doesn't actually know if it should delete something removed from the collection
p27986
aVIn object modeling terms, this is the difference between composition and "aggregation*

VFirstly I'll say that if you're going to have significantly different output for users logged in versus those that aren't, just have two queries rather than trying to create something really complicated
p28200
aVSecondly, this should do something like what you want:
p28201
aVNote: You don't say what the values of the votes table are
p28202
aVI'm assuming it's either +1 (up) or -1 (down) so you can easily find the total votes by adding them up
p28203
aVIf you're not doing it this way I suggest you do to make your life easier
p28204
aVThe first correlated subquery can be eliminated by doing a  and  but I tend to find the above form much more readable
p28205
aVSo what this does is it joins users to posts, much like you were doing except that it uses  syntax (which again comes down to readability)
p28206
aVThen it has two subqueries: the first finds the total votes for that particular post and the second finds out what a particular user's vote was:

VJavascript is always synchronous and single-threaded meaning if you're executing a Javascript block of code on a page then no other Javascript on that page will currently be executed
p28216
aVJavascript is only asynchronous in the sense that it can make, for example, AJAX calls
p28217
aVThe code will stop executing until the call returns (successfully or in error), at which point the callback will run synchronously
p28218
aVNo other code will be running at this point
p28219
aVIt won't interrupt any other code that's running
p28220
aVThis same kind of callback operates with Javascript timers
p28221
aVDescribing Javascript as asynchronous is perhaps misleading
p28222
aVIti's more accurate to say that Javascript is synchronous and single-threaded with various callback mechanisms
p28223
aVjQuery has an option on AJAX calls to make them synchronously (with the  option)
p28224
aVIt's a beginner error to be tempted to use this as it allows a more traditional programming model that one might be more used to

aVAlternatively you can fire off an AJAX request every 15 seconds (pick a number) to check on the status of what you've started

p28410
aVI'm working on a true Markdown parser and I tried it with ANTLR
p28411
aVThere are a couple of ways you can deal with this
p28412
aVFirstly you could just parse:
p28413
aVand work it out in the parsing step, possibly as a rewrite rule
p28414
aVThing is these are only important when they appear at the beginning of a line so here is another approach:
p28415
aVThe above may need to be a parser rule rather than a lexical rule too
p28416
aVI forget
p28417
aVBut even this is unsatisfying because it sort of forces you to treat the Markdown source as a sequence of lines, which isn't really what you want in other parts
p28418
aVAlso normally each lexical rule can only result in one token so you have to overwrite another class that escapes me to allow for emitting multiple tokens
p28419
aVThere is an example of this in the (excellent and almost required) The Definitive ANTLR Reference: Building Domain-Specific Languages

VFirstly some terminology:
p28541
aVNo-args constructor: a constructor with no parameters;
p28542
aVAccessible no-args constructor: a no-args constructor in the superclass visible to the subclass
p28543
aVThat means it is either public or protected or, if both classes are in the same package, package access; and
p28544
aVDefault constructor: the public no-args constructor added by the compiler when there is no explicit constructor in the class
p28545
aVSo all classes have at least one constructor
p28546
aVSubclasses constructors may specify as the first thing they do which constructor in the superclass to invoke before executing the code in the subclass's constructor
p28547
aVIf the subclass constructor does not specify which superclass constructor to invoke then the compiler will automatically call the accessible no-args constructor in the superclass
p28548
aVIf the superclass has no no-arg constructor or it isn't accessible then not specifying the superclass constructor to be called (in the subclass constructor) is a compiler error so it must be specified
p28549
aVFor example:
p28550
aVThis is fine because if you add no constructor explicitly Java puts in a public default constructor for you
p28551
aVAlso fine
p28552
aVThe above is a compilation error as Base has no default constructor

VThis is a fairly common problem in data modelling
p28895
aVBasically it comes down to this:
p28896
aVAre you interesting in the view now, the view at a point in time or both
p28897
aVFor example, if you have a service that models subscriptions you need to know:
p28898
aVWhat services someone had at a point in time: this is needed to work out how much to charge, to see a history of the account and so forth; and
p28899
aVWhat services someone has now: what can they access on the Website
p28900
aVThe starting point for this kind of problem is to have a history table, such as:
p28901
aVService history: id, userid, serviceid, start_date, end_date
p28902
aVChain together the service histories for a user and you have their history
p28903
aVSo how do you model what they have now
p28904
aVThe easiest (and most denormalized view) is to say the last record or the record with a NULL end date or a present or future end date is what they have now
p28905
aVAs you can imagine this can lead to some gnarly SQL so this is selectively denomralized so you have a Services table and another table for history
p28906
aVEach time Services is changed a history record is created or updated
p28907
aVThis kind of approach makes the history table more of an audit table (another term you'll see bandied about)
p28908
aVThis is analagous to your problem
p28909
aVYou need to know:
p28910
aVWho is the current MP for each seat in the House of Representatives;
p28911
aVWho is the current Senator for each seat;
p28912
aVWho is the current Minister for each department;
p28913
aVWho is the Prime Minister
p28914
aVBut you also need to know who was each of those things at a point in time so you need a history for all those things
p28915
aVSo on the 20th August 2003, Peter Costello made a press release you would need to know that at this time he was:
p28916
aVThe Member for Higgins;
p28917
aVThe Treasurer; and
p28918
aVThe Deputy Prime Minister
p28919
aVbecause conceivably someone could be interesting in finding all press releases by Peter Costello or the Treasurer, which will lead to the same press release but will be impossible to trace without the history
p28920

VJava 5 enums originated from a typesafe enum pattern from Joshua Bloch's Effective Java (the first edition) to avoid the pitfalls of enums in C/C++/C# (which are simply thinly-veiled int constants) and the use in Java of final static int constants
p29004
aVPrimarily int constants and int enums aren't typesafe
p29005
aVYou can pass in any int value
p29006
aVIn C/C++ you can do this:
p29007
aVUnfortunately the typesafe enum pattern from Effective Java had a lot of boilerplate, not all of it obvious
p29008
aVThe most notable is you had to override the private method  to stop Java creating new instances on deserialization, which would break simple reference checking (ie using the  operator instead of )
p29009
aVSo Java 5 enums offer these advantages over ints:
p29010
aVType safety;
p29011
aVJava 5 enums can have behaviour and implement interfaces;
p29012
aVJava 5 enums have some extremely lightweight data structures like  and

aVJava 5 enums over these advantages over just using classes:
p29014
aVLess error-prone boilerplate (private constructor,  etc);

p29016
aVYou see something is an enum and you know it's just representing a value
p29017
aVYou see a class and you're not sure
p29018

p29124

p29125
aVImagine a sequence of calls:
p29126

aVWhat you have there is conversational state, meaning the second call must be made to the same bean as the first call or it just won't make sense
p29127
aVThat's what stateful session beans do
p29128
aVStateless session beans can have instance variables but those are essentially global
p29129
aVIf you have a pool of stateless session beans (which you might or might not depending on what the container decides to do), those instances variables might or might not exist from one call to the next
p29130
aVSo generally avoid instance variables
p29131
aVThere are other mechanisms for that kind of thing
p29132
aVLet me give you an example
p29133
aVImagine this call in a stateless session bean:
p29134
aVif you put in an instance variable to count the number of bookings and increment it on each call then subsequent calls might call different beans so will see different values
p29135
aVThat's what I mean about it not necessarily making sense
p29136
aVSo going back to the first example, one way to handle this would be to pass state back to the caller:

aVSee how the above no longer has conversational state

aVYou will want to make sure you don't traverse the same page twice (within a single traversal)

p29524
aVSo if you do:

p29526
aVSo in the function I have above,  references a line which references the entire file

aVYou just need to think about how references work

VAn Ajax call is an asynchronous request initiated by the browser that does not directly result in a page transition
p29832
aVA servlet request is a Java-specifc term (servlets are a Java specification) for servicing an HTTP request that could get a simple GET or POST (etc) or an Ajax request
p29833
aVAn Ajax ("Asynchronous Javascript and XML") request is sometimes called an XHR request ("XmlHttpRequest"), which is the name most browsers give the object used to send an Ajax request, because at least initially Ajax calls involved the sending and receiving of XML but now it's just as common to send/receive JSON, plain text or HTML
p29834
aVA good example of an Ajax request is the comment system on Stackoverflow
p29835
aVYou can enter a comment in the textbox and click submit
p29836
aVIt doesn't submit the whole page (like a traditional HTML form submission would, which translates into usually a POST but sometimes a GET HTTP request)
p29837
aVInstead the browser will send probably a POST request via XHR to the server and be notified of the response (hence "asynchronous")
p29838
aVBut the server typically can't distinguish between an Ajax request or a page transition because both simply come down to HTTP requests

VThe term "composition" is usually used in terms of object modelling as an expression of a "has-a" relationship and is a form of association (another being aggregation)

p29906
aVSo:
p29907
aVWhat's the difference between composition and aggregation
p29908
aVComposition implies that the child cannot exist without the context of the parent

p29910
aVThat's a composition relationship
p29911
aVDelete the house and the rooms also cease to exist

aVA House also has a number of occupants, being instances of Person
p29913
aVThat's an aggregation relationship because those people exist outside of the context of that house
p29914
aVDelegation is nothing more than an implementation detail
p29915
aVA class has a public interface that describes its state and behaviour

VFirstly, instead of an included file that returns an array I would instead use an
p29941

p29942
aVSecondly, you shouldn't worry about function calls in this case
p29943
aVWhy
p29944
aVBecause you might have 100,000 users but if all 100,000 execute a script and need some config values then your 100,000 function calls are distributed over 100,000 scripts, which will be completely irrelevant as far as performance goes

p29948

p30862
aVEdit: Ok, apparently some clarifications are in order
p30863
aVThe OP specifically mentioned GAE, which none of these methods will work on but I'll mention them since some seem to take exception to their absence
p30864
aVThe Java Compiler API (Java 6+) allows you to compile Java classes at runtime
p30865
aVTechnically you could write out a Java source file to look exactly how you want, compile it and load it
p30866
aVJava bytecode libraries can rewrite classes at runtime
p30867
aVThis is used by such libraries as JPA (and others)
p30868
aVYou could modify classes this way
p30869
aVWhat the OP is referring to however is a) in reference to working on GAE and b) more in the order of how Javascript allows you to modify classes or particular instances at runtime by dynamically adding, removing or change properties
p30870
aVJava certainly doesn't do this and specifically doesn't on the GAE
p30871
aVThe above is not an exception to this just like casting a class to  in C++ so you can read private members doesn't mean C++ doesn't have private members

VThe details are implementation dependent but generally speaking, results are buffered
p30879
aVExecuting a query against a database will return some result set
p30880
aVIf it's sufficiently small all the results may be returned with the initial call or some might be and more results are returned as you iterate over the result object
p30881
aVThink of the sequence this way:
p30882
aVYou open a connection to the database;
p30883
aVThere is possibly a second call to select a database or it might be done as part of (1);
p30884
aVThat authentication and connection step is (at least) one round trip to the server (ignoring persistent connections);
p30885
aVYou execute a query on the client;
p30886
aVThat query is sent to the server;
p30887
aVThe server has to determine how to execute the query;
p30888
aVIf the server has previously executed the query the execution plan may still be in the query cache
p30889
aVIf not a new plan must be created;
p30890
aVThe server executes the query as given and returns a result to the client;
p30891
aVThat result will contain some buffer of rows that is implementation dependent
p30892
aVIt might be 100 rows or more or less
p30893
aVAll columns are returned for each row;
p30894
aVAs you fetch more rows eventually the client will ask the server for more rows
p30895
aVThis may be when the client runs out or it may be done preemptively
p30896
aVAgain this is implementation dependent
p30897
aVThe idea of all this is to minimize roundtrips to the server without sending back too much unnecessary data, which is why if you ask for a million rows you won't get them all back at once
p30898
aVLIMIT clauses--or any clause in fact--will modify the result set
p30899
aVLastly, (7) is important because  and  are two different queries as far as the database optimizer is concerned so an execution plan must be determined for each separately

p31109
aVFor the sake of completeness I'll point out that putting too much in  in the external JS file is a mistake
p31110
aVI started doing this once and ended up with a page load time of 500-1000ms with all this unnecessary JS code that was being executed
p31111
aVThe external JS file(s) should be for declaring functions
p31112
aVThe page itself should declare which of those things to actually run
p31113
aVThis combines the best of minimal code execution and maximises caching (since the JS file is the same for all your pages)
p31114
aVAt the top of the page you don't know what modules/components will be included in the document unless you declare it there as well, which (imho) is a worse case of repeating yourself
p31115
aVThe ideal approach would be some sort of multi-pass templating process that would allow included modules/components to trigger code that needs to be run and your template processor will combine all that and put it at the top of the page
p31116
aVI've actually written systems like this and it is quite doable but it's also more tedious
p31117
aVYou say it's messy but the other side of that coin is that when you look at a page it's easy to determine what code belongs to which module/component because they're adjacent
p31118
aVIf you had a big blob of JS at the top of the page, how do you know what relates to what

VOk, take two:
p31163
aVThis one takes a little explanation
p31164
aVFirstly, let me demonstrate that it is reversible and the resultant conversions should demonstrate the ordering:
p31165
aVOutput:
p31166
aVAs you can see  and  (the first two rows) are correct and the other values basically fall in line
p31167
aVWhat is this doing
p31168
aVAssuming signed byte values you have:
p31169
aV-128 => 0x80
p31170
aV-1 => 0xFF
p31171
aV0 => 0x00
p31172
aV1 => 0x01
p31173
aV127 => 0x7F
p31174
aVNow if you add 0x80 to those values you get:
p31175
aV-128 => 0x00
p31176
aV-1 => 0x7F
p31177
aV0 => 0x80
p31178
aV1 => 0x81
p31179
aV127 => 0xFF
p31180
aVwhich is the correct order (with overflow)
p31181
aVBasically the above is doing that with 64 bit signed longs instead of 8 bit signed bytes
p31182
aVThe conversion back is a little more roundabout
p31183
aVYou might think you can use:
p31184
aVbut you can't
p31185
aVPass in 16 f's to that function (-1) and it will throw an exception
p31186
aVIt seems to be treating that as an unsigned hex value, which  cannot accommodate
p31187
aVSo instead I split it in half and parse each piece, combining them together, left-shifting the first half by 32 bits

aVThe correct answer is: you need a number of threads that produces the best overall result

p31220

p31221

p31222
aVConceptually you can plot that relationship and produce a range of threads that will give you the desired result given certain resource constraints
p31223
aVThe correct number of threads is somewhere in that range
p31224
aVNote: I said "overall result"
p31225
aVThat's not necessarily the "fastest result"
p31226
aVOne thread may do a task in 10 minutes
p31227
aV100 threads may do it in 15 seconds
p31228
aV1000 threads may do it in 10 seconds because you're starting to hit contention limits for your particular problem
p31229
aVIs that a better overall result
p31230
aVThere might be no real difference between 10 and 15 seconds but 1000 threads may use way more memory
p31231
aVRemember that not all threads are CPU bound so it makes perfect sense in a lot of situations to have way more threads than the number of cores because at some point in performing a task a thread may sleep while it waits for something to happen (network communication, disk read, whatever)

aVRegular languages have no concept of state so the expression can't "remember" what else there has been

aVYou could use something like Bresenham's line algorithm to rasterize the hypotenuse and when you hit the column you're in work out if you're above or below that line;

aVYou could store a array of row values, saying that for column 3, the hypotenuse is at offset 2, whereas for 6 it's at 4 and so on

aVEdit: As to why to use  there are several reasons:
p31604
aVSemantic: You're differentiating between the content of your table and "metadata"
p31605
aVThis is most often used to delineate between column headers and data rows;
p31606
aVAccessibility: it helps people who use screen readers to understand the contents of the table;
p31607
aVNon-Screen Media: Printing a multi-page table may allow you to put the  contents at the top of each page so people can understand what the columns meaning without flicking back several pages;
p31608
aVStyling: CSS can be applied to  elements,  elements, both or some other combination
p31609
aVIt gives you something else to write a selector against;
p31610
aVJavascript: this often comes up when using jQuery and similar libraries
p31611

aVOr you might do:
p31615
aVwith:
p31616

p31617
aVLastly, many of these same arguments apply to using  elements over  elements: you're indicating that this cell isn't data but a header of some kind

aVConvert it to PNG (10-30% smaller than GIF on average); and

p31874

aVSee Speed Tips: Add Future Expires Headers for adding the Expires header
p31877
aVYou can do it with a script or with Web server configuration

VYou have three general approaches:
p31887
aVStore the previous page in the session;
p31888
aVStore the page as a GET variable; or
p31889
aVDo an internal redirect to the login page
p31890
aV(1) looks something like:
p31891
aVOn successful login retrieve  and redirect
p31892
aV(2) is similar except there is no session variable
p31893
aVInstead you have:
p31894
aVto pass the redirect
p31895
aVThe login page will have to include it as a hidden form field on the page that presents the user with a request for the username and password
p31896
aV(3) is similar but doesn't redirect to a separate page
p31897
aVInstead each page can potentially be a login page
p31898
aVIf the user isn't logged in a login form is presented instead
p31899
aVThe URL will still be "/contact"
p31900
aVEach page will detect and handle log in attempts
p31901
aVThe advantage of this method is one less external redirect and it's easier to handle submitted forms
p31902
aVBy this I mean that imagine someone fills out a form on one of your pages and then clicks submit
p31903
aVThe system sees their login has expired
p31904
aVIf you redirect the user to a new page and then redirect back they will probably need to re-enter all the form fields

p32472
aVThere is however no limit on a specific port
p32473
aVThere is a limit on the number of concurrent connections however, typically limited by the number of file descriptors the kernel supports (eg 2048)
p32474
aVThe thing to remember is that a TCP connection is unique and a connection is a pair of end points (local and remote IP address and port) so it doesn't matter if 1000 connections connect to the same port on a server because the connections are all still unique because the other end is different
p32475
aVThe other limit to be aware of is that a machine can only make about 64K outbound connections or the kernel limit on connections, whichever is lower

VFor a table that large you will be wanting to find some effective sharding/partitioning strategy
p32692
aVArchiving in this sense tends to be a form of partitioning but not a good one since you often want to query over the current and archive anyway
p32693
aVIn the worst cases you end up with a SELECT over a UNION of the archive and current tables, which is worse than if you hadn't split them at all
p32694
aVYou will often do better by finding some other means to slice the data, say on a record type or something

aVFirstly, you can just use Google to host your jQuery file:

aVSecondly you can use it to do async loads of jQuery, which is what you're referring to
p32710
aVIf you do this the pattern is:
p32711
aVThe reason you have to use  is because loading jQuery in this case is asynchronous so you need to wait for jQuery to be loaded and the document to be ready

aVThe reason you have to use jQuery inside the load callback is because it may not be loaded anywhere else at the time you run the Javascript, leading to a potential race condition and intermittent errors

p32875
aVEndianness: different CPU architectures put the bytes that make up an int in different orders
p32876
aVDepending on how you come up with the byte array to begin with you may have to worry about this; and
p32877
aVBuffering: if you grab 1024 bytes at a time and start a sequence at element 1022 you will hit the end of the buffer before you get 4 bytes
p32878
aVIt's probably better to use some form of buffered input stream that does the buffered automatically so you can just use  repeatedly and not worry about it otherwise;
p32879
aVTrailing Buffer: the end of the input may be an uneven number of bytes (not a multiple of 4 specifically) depending on the source
p32880
aVBut if you create the input to begin with and being a multiple of 4 is "guaranteed" (or at least a precondition) you may not need to concern yourself with it

aVthe object reference field are
p33114
aVdeserialized
p33115
aVIt's not a case of only working if all the fields are transient, it's that it's only safe if all Object references are transient
p33116
aVThe slide you reference goes further and says is any fields are non-transient an attacker can grab a reference to the deserialized Object

aVThe model is fairly simple:
p33721
aVEach client connects to a Web server with an AJAX request that is configured on the server not to timeout;
p33722
aVIf it does timeout for any reason the client is configured to issue another AJAX request;
p33723
aVThe server endpoint for that AJSX call does a thread wait operation on some monitor waiting for updates;
p33724
aVWhen the user sends a chat it is sent to the server and any relevant monitors are signaled;
p33725
aVAny threads listening to that monitor are woken up, retrieve any messages waiting for them and return that as the AJAX result to the client;
p33726
aVThe client renders those messages and then issues another AJAX request to listen to for messages
p33727
aVThis is the basic framework but isn't the end of the story
p33728
aVAny scalable chat system will support either internal or external federation (meaning the clients can connect to more than one server) but unless you're Google, Facebook or Twitter you're unlikely to have this problem

VIt's a fundamental property of  that when you compare it to anything\u2014including \u2014it returns , which is why what you're doing doesn't work
p33748
aVSo the first question to answer is: why do you want a row with a   be returned when they enter a  of "smith"
p33749
aVPossibly you mean that either the firstname or the lastname needs to match to be returned, in which case you're not running the correct query
p33750
aVThe most naive solution is:
p33751

aVs are typically woeful in terms of performance

p33756
aVThere are several solutions to (2)
p33757
aVProbably the easiest in MySQL is to use full text searching on MyISAM tables
p33758
aVIt won't find matches like "Johannes" if you type in "han" but it is generally sufficient
p33759
aVOften you deal with  conditions by using either  or (preferably)  on multiple queries
p33760
aVFor example:
p33761
aVLooks big and ugly but  scales extremely well (ignoring the  at the start of the  criteria)
p33762
aVIt's basically concatenating (in this case) four queries
p33763
aVA  will do an implicit  on the result rows but we know there'll be no overlap here because we're varying checking for
p33764
aVAnother possibility is not to treat  as something you want to search for
p33765
aVThis is a far better and more intuitive solution (imho)
p33766
aVIf someone types in a lastname of "Smith" do you really want rows with a  lastname showing up
p33767
aVOr do you want them to show up because you might've got a match on the first name

p33977
aV6 bits = 64 values

aV8 bits = 256 values
p33979
aVThe code you're using is taking the naive approach that x5 * 256/32 = x8 where 256/32 = 8 and multiplying by 8 is left shift 3 but, as you say, this doesn't necessarily fill the new number space "correctly"

p33982
aVNow there is a question about the best way to implement this
p33983
aVIt does involve division and with integer division you will lose any remainder result (round down basically) so the best solution is probably to do floating point arithmetic and then round half up back to an integer

aVBoth are forms of transliteration, being the process of converting from one alphabet to another
p34105
aVASCII to UTF8, ASCII to base64, etc are all examples of this
p34106
aVWhat distinguishes the two is that "encoding" is often used when transliterating from a usable format to a transmission or intermediate format of some kind and decoding is the reverse
p34107
aVThis is where the "subjective" bit comes in
p34108
aVASCII to UTF8 can be viewed as encoding or decoding depending on the context
p34109
aVOther formats like base64 are used almost universally for transmission only (eg binary data in email) and as such converting to them is almost universally called "encoding" and converting from as "decoding"
p34110
aVThe important point to take away from all this is that something like ASCII or UTF8 is not magical in any way
p34111

p34112

p34224
aVFirstly, the simplest case is you simply need more heap

aVYou're using 512M max heap when your program could operate correctly with 2G
p34226
aVIncrease is with  as a JVM option and you're fine
p34227
aVAlso be aware than 64 bit VMs will use up to twice the memory of 32 bit VMs depending on the makeup of that data
p34228

p34229
aVReplacing objects with primitives and so on
p34230
aVThis might be an option
p34231
aVI can't really say based on what you've posted
p34232
aVUltimately however you come to a cross roads where you have to make a choice between virtulization and partitioning
p34233
aVVirtualizing in this context simply means some form of pretending there is more memory than there is
p34234
aVOperating systems use this with virtual address spaces and using hard disk space as extra memory
p34235
aVThis could mean only keeping some of the data structure in memory at a time and persisting the rest to secondary storage (eg file or database)
p34236
aVPartitioning is splitting your data across multiple servers (either real or virtual)
p34237
aVFor example, if you were keeping track of stock trades on the NASDAQ you could put stock codes starting with "A" on server1, "B" on server2, etc
p34238
aVYou need to find a reasonable approach to slice your data such that you reduce or eliminate the need for cross-communication because that cross-communication is what limits your scalability
p34239
aVSo simple case, if what you're storing is 30K words and 30K x 30K combinations of words you could divide it up into four server:

aVThis white space is ignored (not captured);

aVThis is (imho) the preferable way to using negative character groups (eg ) for this kind of problem;

p34507
aVThe jQuery effects only work with block type elements

aVThe jQuery effects manipulate inline element style, which is why that version works and the class version doesn't
p34509
aVIf you think about it block type elements are rectangles
p34510
aVThey're easy to animate growing and shrinking because you simply animate their height and/or width

aVTo give you an example:

aVLike everything they have strengths and weaknesses

aVEdit: in relation to the comment regarding IE treating them differently, two rules of thumb apply:
p34766

VFrom the Java Collections API Design FAQ:
p36039
aVWhy doesn't Map extend Collection
p36040
aVThis was by design
p36041
aVWe feel that
p36042
aVmappings are not collections and
p36043
aVcollections are not mappings
p36044
aVThus, it
p36045
aVmakes little sense for Map to extend
p36046
aVthe Collection interface (or vice
p36047
aVversa)
p36048
aVIf a Map is a Collection, what are the
p36049
aVelements
p36050
aVThe only reasonable answer
p36051
aVis "Key-value pairs", but this
p36052
aVprovides a very limited (and not
p36053
aVparticularly useful) Map abstraction
p36054
aVYou can't ask what value a given key
p36055
aVmaps to, nor can you delete the entry
p36056
aVfor a given key without knowing what
p36057
aVvalue it maps to
p36058
aVCollection could be made to extend
p36059
aVMap, but this raises the question:
p36060
aVwhat are the keys
p36061
aVThere's no really
p36062
aVsatisfactory answer, and forcing one
p36063
aVleads to an unnatural interface
p36064
aVMaps can be viewed as Collections (of
p36065
aVkeys, values, or pairs), and this fact
p36066
aVis reflected in the three "Collection
p36067
aVview operations" on Maps (keySet,
p36068
aVentrySet, and values)
p36069
aVWhile it is, in
p36070
aVprinciple, possible to view a List as
p36071
aVa Map mapping indices to elements,
p36072
aVthis has the nasty property that
p36073
aVdeleting an element from the List
p36074
aVchanges the Key associated with every
p36075
aVelement before the deleted element
p36076
aVThat's why we don't have a map view
p36077
aVoperation on Lists
p36078
aVUpdate: I think the quote answers most of the questions
p36079
aVIt's worth stressing the part about a collection of entries not being a particularly useful abstraction
p36080
aVFor example:
p36081
aVwould allow:
p36082
aV(assuming an  method that creates a  instance)
p36083
aVs require unique keys so this would violate this
p36084
aVOr if you impose unique keys on a  of entries, it's not really a  in the general sense
p36085
aVIt's a  with further restrictions
p36086
aVArguably you could say the / relationship for  was purely on the key but even that has issues
p36087
aVMore importantly, does it really add any value
p36088
aVYou may find this abstraction breaks down once you start looking at the corner cases
p36089
aVIt's worth noting that the  is actually implemented as a , not the other way around
p36090
aVThis is purely an implementation detail but is interesting nonetheless
p36091
aVThe main reason for  to exist is to simplify traversal so you don't have to traverse the keys and then do a lookup of the key
p36092
aVDon't take it as prima facie evidence that a  should be a  of entries (imho)

VMy advice would be to do it slightly differently
p36099
aVHave just one class with the default state being the other

p36101
aVand then this is as simple as:
p36102
aVor more specifically:
p36103
aVNote: avoid using  and
p36104
aVThey usually don't mean what you think they mean
p36105
aVand  tend to be what you really mean
p36106
aVI would probably write something like:
p36107
aVPut it into a separate function if you wish
p36108
aVEdit: to check whether something is empty:
p36109
aVjQuery objects support the  property and the  method, which do the same thing

VMake sure you have indexes on:
p36116
aVequipment (tiremap)
p36117
aVtiremap (TireID)
p36118
aVtiremap (WorkMap)
p36119
aVworkreference (aMap)
p36120
aVworkreference (bMap)
p36121
aVtirework (workmap)
p36122
aVEdit: I guess I should provide some context to that for completeness
p36123
aVThe SQL optimizer looks at a statement, parses it and then determines an execution plan for it based on the query, the tables referenced and available indexes
p36124
aVIf you do  then it'll do a full table scan of tab1 because there's no other way to execute that
p36125
aVIf you do  and you have a million records, it will be slow to interrogate every row but if  is indexed it's much more efficient
p36126
aVWith a query like yours one of those tables will be the driving table that regardless of indexes may simply be done as a full table scan
p36127
aVThere's nothing wrong with this
p36128
aVOne table has to drive the query
p36129
aVIf there is a  clause (for something other than join conditions) this may change but otherwise it's generally true
p36130
aVFrom that driving table, MySQL will then start appending joins to the execution plan
p36131
aVThese joins will require indexes on the other side to make this work efficiently
p36132
aVSo with three tables you may have one table that's not indexed but it doesn't matter because it drives the query
p36133
aVWith the fourth table, there may be two unindexed tables and that's now a problem because for each row in one MySQL will have to do a full table scan of the other
p36134
aVSo basically you create an index on every foreign key and join column so MySQL can use what's available to make the best execution plan for the query you give it
p36135
aVLastly, most tools will tell you about the database schema
p36136
aVPHPMyAdmin is a popular one for hosted databases
p36137
aVPersonally I actually like a desktop app for this kind of thing
p36138
aVNavicat Lite is a decent free tool for this

VThis all depends on what  are and what they do
p36145
aVIf the list is fairly stable, s can be a good solution:
p36146
aVThe good thing about s is they basically are classes so the can implement interfaces and have state and behaviour
p36147
aVThey also come with useful helper classes:
p36148
aVand then you can use all the  functions like  etc
p36149
aVBut I can't tell you if this is an appropriate solution for you without knowing more information
p36150
aVEdit: a common starting point for this in many languages is enums
p36151
aVIn C/C++/C# this would go something like:
p36152
aVHere's how Java's enums are better
p36153
aVLet's say you define another enum for stock type:
p36154
aVIf you make the assumption a given merchant type sells one type of thing:
p36155
aVso instead of saying:
p36156
aVyou say:
p36157
aVJava enums have state and behaviour
p36158
aVThat's an extremely powerful concept
p36159
aVBut you can do better than this
p36160
aVInstead of assuming one stock per merchant, this is better handled by behaviour:

VThe answer to this question depends on exactly what you want to learn
p36206
aVPython and Ruby
p36207
aVHigh level languages like Python and Ruby are often suggested because they are high level and the syntax is quite readable
p36208
aVHowever these languages all have abstractions for the common data structures
p36209
aVThere's nothing stopping you implementing your own versions as a learning exercise but you may find that you're building high level data structures on top of other high level data structures, which isn't necessarily useful
p36210
aVAlso, Ruby and Python are dynamically typed languages
p36211
aVThis can be good but it can also be confusing for the beginner and it can be harder (initially) to catch errors since they typically won't be apparent until runtime
p36212
ag13554
aVC is at the other extreme
p36213
aVIt's good if you want to learn really low-level details like how the memory is managed but memory management is suddenly an important consideration, as in correct usage of malloc()/free()
p36214
aVThat can be distracting
p36215
aVAlso, C isn't object-oriented
p36216
aVThat's not a bad thing but simply worth noting
p36217
aVC++
p36218
aVC++ has been mentioned
p36219
aVAs I said in the comment, I think this is a terrible choice
p36220
aVC++ is hideously complicated even in simple usage and has a ridiculous amount of "gotchas"
p36221
aVAlso, C++ has no common base class
p36222
aVThis is important because data structures like hash tables rely on there being a common base class
p36223
aVYou could implement a version for a nominal base class but it's a little less useful
p36224
aVJava
p36225
aVJava has also been mentioned
p36226
aVMany people like to hate Java and it's true that the language is extremely verbose and lacking in some of the more modern language features (eg closures) but none of that really matters
p36227
aVJava is statically typed and has garbage collection
p36228
aVThis means the Java compiler will catch many errors that dynamically typed languages won't (until runtime) and there's no dealing with segmentation faults (which isn't to say you can't leak memory in Java; obviously you can)
p36229
aVI think Java is a fine choice
p36230
aVC#
p36231
aVC# the language is like a more modern version of Java
p36232
aVLike Java it is a managed (garbage collected) intermediate compiled language that runs on a virtual machine
p36233
aVEvery other language listed here apart form C/C++ also run on a virtual machine but Python, Ruby, etc are interpreted directly rather than compiled to bytecode
p36234
aVC# has the same pros and cons as Java, basically
p36235
aVHaskell (etc)
p36236
aVLastly you have the functional languages: Haskell, OCaml, Scheme/Lisp, Clojure, F#, etc
p36237
aVThese think about all problems in a very different way and are worth learning at some point but again it comes down to what you want to learn: functional programming or data structures
p36238
aVI'd stick to learning one thing at a time rather than confusing the issue
p36239
aVIf you do learn a functional language at some point (which I would recommend), Haskell is a safe and fine choice
p36240
aVMy Advice
p36241
aVPick Java or C#
p36242
aVBoth have free, excellent IDEs (Eclipse, Netbeans and IntelliJ Community Edition for Java, Visual Studio Express for C#) that make writing and running code a snap
p36243
aVIf you use no native data structure more complex than an array and any object you yourself write you'll learn basically the same thing as you would in C/C++ but without having to actually manage memory
p36244
aVLet me explain: an extensible hash table needs to be resized if sufficient elements are added
p36245
aVIn any implementation that will mean doing something like doubling the size of the backing data structure (typically an array) and copying in the existing elements
p36246
aVThe implementation is basically the same in all imperative languages but in C/C++ you have to deal with segmentation fauls when you don't allocate or deallocate something correctly
p36247
aVPython or Ruby (it doesn't really matter which) would be my next choice (and very close to the other two) just because the dynamic typing could be problematic at first

VThe quintessential example of this is an array of pointers to structs or objects (that are mutable)
p36254
aVA shallow copy copies the array and maintains references to the original objects
p36255
aVA deep copy will copy (clone) the objects too so they bear no relation to the original
p36256
aVImplicit in this is that the object themselves are deep copied
p36257
aVThis is where it gets hard because there's no real way to know if something was deep copied or not
p36258
aVThe copy constructor is used to initilize the new object with the previously created object of the same class
p36259
aVBy default compiler wrote a shallow copy
p36260
aVShallow copy works fine when dynamic memory allocation is not involved because when dynamic memory allocation is involved then both objects will points towards the same memory location in a heap, Therefore to remove this problem we wrote deep copy so both objects have their own copy of attributes in a memory

aVIn tags;
p36369
aVIn the HTML; and
p36370
aVIn an external file
p36371
aVLet me address each of those
p36372
aVBest practice is to have common Javascript in one or more external files and the less files the better since each JS file loaded will block loading of the page until that JS file is loaded
p36373
aVThe word "common" is extremely important
p36374
aVWhat that means is you don't want to put page-specific Javascript code in that external file for caching reasons
p36375
aVLet's say you have a site with 1000 pages
p36376
aVEach page has JS code specific to it
p36377
aVThat could either be 1000 different files or one really big file that executes a lot of unnecessary code (eg looking for IDs that aren't on that particular page but are on one of the 999 others)
p36378
aVNeither of these outcomes is good
p36379
aVThe first gives you little caching boost
p36380
aVThe second can have horrific page load times
p36381
aVSo what you do is put all common functions in one JS file where that JS file only contains functions
p36382
aVIn each HTML page you call the JS functions needed for that page
p36383
aVIdeally your JS files are cached effectively too
p36384
aVBest practice is to use a far futures HTTP Expires header and a version number so the JS file is only loaded once by each browser no matter how many pages they visit
p36385
aVWhen you change the file you change the version number and it forces a reload
p36386
aVUsing mtime (last modified time of the JS file) is a common scheme, giving URLs like:
p36387
aVwhere that mtime is automatically generated
p36388
aVYour Web server is configured to serve JS files with an appropriate Expires header
p36389
aVSo that mixes external files and in-page scripts in (imho) the best way possible

p36561
aVThey simply decrement the size
p36562
aVThe reasoning for this is that if you have 1000 elements in an array and delete 1, why reallocate and copy the array
p36563
aVIt's hugely wasteful for very little gain
p36564
aVBasically Java s have two important properties and it's important to understand they are different:
p36565
aVsize: how many elements are notionally in the ; and
p36566
aVcapacity: how many elements can fit in the underlying array
p36567
aVWhen an  expands, it grows by about 50% in size even if you're only adding one element
p36568
aVThis is a similar principle in reverse
p36569
aVBasically it comes down to this: reallocating the array and copying the values is (relatively) expensive
p36570

aVStatic/Dynamic Typing
p36709
aVStatic typing is where the type is bound to the variable
p36710
aVTypes are checked at compile time
p36711

p36712
aVTypes are checked at run time

p36714
aVwill "forever" be a
p36715
aVDuring its life it may point to different s (since  is a reference in Java)
p36716
aVIt may have a  value but it will never refer to an  or a
p36717
aVThat's static typing
p36718
aVIn PHP:
p36719
aVThat's dynamic typing
p36720
aVStrong/Weak Typing
p36721
aV(Edit alert
p36722
aVStrong typing is a phrase with no widely agreed upon meaning
p36723
aVMost programmers who use this term to mean something other than static typing use it to imply that there is a type discipline that is enforced by the compiler
p36724
aVFor example, CLU has a strong type system that does not allow client code to create a value of abstract type except by using the constructors provided by the type
p36725
aVC has a somewhat strong type system, but it can be "subverted" to a degree because a program can always cast a value of one pointer type to a value of another pointer type
p36726
aVSo for example, in C you can take a value returned by  and cheerfully cast it to , and the compiler won't try to stop you\u2014or even warn you that you are doing anything dodgy
p36727
aV(The original answer said something about a value "not changing type at run time"
p36728
aVI have known many language designers and compiler writers and have not known one that talked about values changing type at run time, except possibly some very advanced research in type systems, where this is known as the "strong update problem"
p36729
aVWeak typing implies that the compiler does not enforce a typing discpline, or perhaps that enforcement can easily be subverted
p36730
aVThe original of this answer conflated weak typing with implicit conversion (sometimes also called "implicit promotion")
p36731
aVFor example, in Java:
p36732
aVThis is code is an example of implicit promotion: 123 is implicitly converted to a string before being concatenated with
p36733
aVIt can be argued the Java compiler rewrites that code as:
p36734
aVConsider a classic PHP "starts with" problem:
p36735
aVThe error here is that  returns the index of the match, being 0
p36736
aV0 is coerced into boolean  and thus the condition is actually true
p36737
aVThe solution is to use  instead of  to avoid implicit conversion
p36738
aVThis example illustrates how a combination of implicit conversion and dynamic typing can lead programmers astray
p36739
aVCompare that to Ruby:
p36740
aVwhich is a runtime error because in Ruby the object 123 is not implicitly converted just because it happens to be passed to a  method
p36741
aVIn Ruby the programmer must make the conversion explicit:
p36742
aVComparing PHP and Ruby is a good illustration here
p36743
aVBoth are dynamically typed languages but PHP has lots of implicit conversions and Ruby (perhaps surprisingly if you're unfamiliar with it) doesn't
p36744
aVStatic/Dynamic vs Strong/Weak
p36745
aVThe point here is that the static/dynamic axis is independent of the strong/weak axis
p36746
aVPeople confuse them probably in part because strong vs weak typing is not only less clearly defined, there is no real consensus on exactly what is meant by strong and weak
p36747
aVFor this reason strong/weak typing is far more of a shade of grey rather than black or white
p36748
aVSo to answer your question: another way to look at this that's mostly correct is to say that static typing is compile-time type safety and strong typing is runtime type safety
p36749
aVThe reason for this is that variables in a statically typed language have a type that must be declared and can be checked at compile time
p36750
aVA strongly-typed language has values that have a type at run time, and it's difficult for the programmer to subvert the type system without a dynamic check
p36751
aVBut it's important to understand that a language can be Static/Strong, Static/Weak, Dynamic/Strong or Dynamic/Weak

p36771
aVThe reason a lot of people love it is that it forces people to format their code
p36772
aVI can't say I've ever met anyone who "hates" it because hating it is much like hating the idea of well-formatted code
p36773
aVEdit: let me put this in some perspective
p36774
aVIn the Java world there are two main methods of packaging and deploying Web apps: Ant and Maven
p36775
aVAnt is basically an XML-based Make facility that has tasks for the common things you do
p36776
aVIt's a blank slate, which is powerful, but it also means you have to write a lot of common things yourself and every installation is free to do things slightly differently
p36777
aVAll of this is well-intentioned but can make it hard to figure out someone's Ant scripts
p36778
aVMaven is far more fully features
p36779
aVIt has archetypes, which are basically project types
p36780
aVDepending on which archetype(s) you use, you won't have to write any tasks to start, stop, clean, build, etc but you will have a mandated directory structure, which is quite deep
p36781
aVThe advantage of that is if you've seen one Maven Web app you've seen them all
p36782
aVYou know the commands
p36783
aVYou know the structure
p36784
aVThat's extremely useful
p36785
aVBut you have people who absolutely hate Maven and I think it comes down to this: they don't like giving up control, even when it's ultimately in their interest to do so
p36786
aVAlso, you'll find a certain brand of person who thinks that their use case is a justifiable exception
p36787
aVYou see this personality trait a lot
p36788
aVFor example, I think an old Joel post mentioned a story where someone wanted to use "enter" to go from the username to password form fields even though the convention was that enter executed the default action (usually "OK") so they had to write a custom dialog class for Windows for this
p36789
aVBasically some people just don't like being told what to do and others are completely obstinate in their belief that they're right even when all evidence points to the contrary
p36790
aVThis probably explains why some supposedly hate Python's white space: they don't like being told how to format their code

p36875
aVWrite however many records you need
p36876
aVClose connection
p36877
aVTransactions can complicate this
p36878
aVIf you are doing non-transactional inserts, absolutely use one connection and write each record one at a time
p36879
aVIf you are using transactions and writing a truly huge data set (ie millions of rows) then your database may need to be tuned so it has sufficient temporary storage to deal with that
p36880
aVBasically if a single insert is taking a second it suggests to me one or more of:
p36881
aVYou foreign keys aren't indexed so the referential integrity checks on the insert are woefully inefficient; or
p36882
aVExcessive connection opening and closing
p36883
aVNow all that being said, having multiple "workers" doing inserts can lead to useful increases in overall throughput but at 1 second per insert, that isn't your problem
p36884

VSome inner classes are exposed publicly (eg  in Java) but that is by far the exception rather than the norm
p36907
aVInner classes are, basically, an implementation detail
p36908
aVFor example, Swing makes extensive use of inner classes for event listeners
p36909
aVWithout them you would end up polluting the global namespace with a bunch of classes you otherwise don't need to see (which may make their purpose harder to determine)
p36910
aVEssentially inner classes are a form of scope
p36911
aVPackage access hides classes from outside the package
p36912

aVInner classes in Java are also a substitute for a lack of function pointers or method delegates (which are in C#) or closures

p37338
aVWith a minimum value of 1 consider the sequence:
p37339
aVThe sum of such a sequence is equal to:
p37340
aVso for n = 4, as an example, the sum is 10
p37341
aVThat means if you're selecting 4 different numbers the minimum total with no zeroes and no negatives is 10
p37342
aVNow go in reverse: if you have a total of 10 and 4 numbers then there is only one combination of (1,2,3,4)
p37343
aVSo first you need to check if your total is at least as high as this lower bound
p37344
aVIf it is less there is no combination
p37345
aVIf it is equal, there is precisely one combination
p37346
aVIf it is higher it gets more complicated
p37347
aVNow imagine your constraints are a total of 12 with 4 numbers
p37348
aVWe've established that f(4) = 10
p37349
aVBut what if the first (lowest) number is 2
p37350
aVSo the first number can't be higher than 1
p37351
aVYou know your first number
p37352
aVNow you generate a sequence of 3 numbers with a total of 11 (being 12 - 1)
p37353
aVThe second number has to be 2 because it can't be one
p37354
aVIt can't be 3 because the minimum sum of three numbers starting with 3 is 12 and we have to add to 11
p37355
aVNow we find two numbers that add up to 9 (12 - 1 - 2) with 3 being the lowest possible
p37356
aVThe third number can be 3 or 4
p37357
aVWith the third number found the last is fixed

aVConsider this recursive implementation:

p37362
aVOne implementation of this would be to get all the sequences and select one at random
p37363
aVThis has the advantage of equally weighting all possible combinations, which may or may not be useful or necessary to what you're doing

VIt depends on what you mean by "multithreaded"
p37793
aVJavascript code is distinctly singlethreaded
p37794
aVNo Javascript code will interrupt any other Javascript code currently executing on the same page
p37795
aVAn AJAX (XHR) request will trigger the browser to do something and (typically) call a callback when it completes
p37796
aVOn the server each Ajax request is a separate HTTP request
p37797
aVEach of these will execute on their own thread
p37798
aVDepending on th Web server config, they may not even execute on the same machine
p37799
aVBut each PHP script instance will be entirely separate, even if calling the same script
p37800
aVThere is no shared state per se
p37801
aVNow browsers typically cap the number of simultaneous Ajax requests a page can make on a per host basis
p37802
aVThis number is typically 2
p37803
aVI believe you can change it but since the majority of people will have the default value, you have to assume it will be 2
p37804
aVMore requests than that will queue until an existing request completes
p37805
aVThis can lead to having to do annoying things like creating multiple host names like req1
p37806
aVexample
p37807
aVcom, req2
p37808
aVexample
p37809
aVcom, etc
p37810
aVThe one exception is sessions but they aren't multithreaded
p37811
aVStarting a session will block all other scripts attempting to start the exact same session (based on the cookie)
p37812
aVThis is one reason why you need to minimize the amount of time a session is opened for
p37813
aVArguably you could use a database or something like memcache to kludge inter-script communication but it's not really what PHP is about
p37814
aVPHP is best used for simple request processing
p37815
aVA request is received
p37816
aVIt is processed and a response is returned
p37817
aVThat response could be HTML, XML, text, JSON or whatever
p37818
aVThe request could be an HTTP request from the browser or an AJAX request
p37819
aVEach of these request-response cycles should, where possible, be treated as separate entities
p37820
aVAnother technique used is long-polling
p37821
aVAn HTTP request is sent to the server and may not return for a long time
p37822
aVThis is used for Web-based chat and other "server push" type scenarios
p37823
aVSometimes partial responses will be flushed without ending the request
p37824

p38108
aVThat leaves 8
p38109
aV4M spaces for 1
p38110
aV1M characters
p38111
aVYou can then solve this is an equation
p38112
aVChoose an encoding scheme where the first byte determines how many bytes are used
p38113
aVSo there are 128 values
p38114
aVEach of these will represent either 256 characters (2 bytes total) or 65,536 characters (3 bytes total)
p38115
aVSo:
p38116
aV256x + 65536(128-x) = 1114112 - 128
p38117
aVSolving this you need 111 values of the first byte as 2 byte characters and the remaining 17 as 3 byte
p38118
aVTo check:
p38119
aV128 + 111 * 256 + 17 * 65536 = 1,114,256
p38120
aVTo put it another way:
p38121
aV128 code points require 1 byte;
p38122
aV28,416 code points require 2 bytes; and
p38123
aV1,114,112 code points require 3 bytes
p38124
aVOf course, this doesn't allow for the inevitable expansion of Unicode, which UTF-8 does
p38125
aVYou can adjust this to the first byte meaning:
p38126
aV0-127 (128) = 1 byte;
p38127
aV128-191 (64) = 2 bytes;
p38128
aV192-255 (64) = 3 bytes
p38129
aVThis would be better because it's simple bitwise AND tests to determine length and gives an address space of 4,210,816 code points

VYou need to implement a system of push notification
p38149
aVThere are a couple of ways of doing this
p38150
aVYou could simply poll for changes:
p38151
aVEvery 30 seconds this checks for new awards
p38152
aVIf something new is required, the PHP script returns an appropriate JSON object as to the type of award and so on
p38153
aVAnother way is to use faux push notification:
p38154
aVThis is sometimes called long-polling
p38155
aVYou need to change it so your PHP script doesn't end until there's something to return
p38156

aVSince you're new to Java, this may introduce a few new concepts to you

VThere is no fundamental problem with using a lot of memory
p38535
aVIf the VM size is too large and you create a lot of objects that need to be garbage collected, you will need to do a GC more often, which means a full GC more often
p38536
aVA full GC on a really large VM can cause "freezes" of up to seconds
p38537
aVFor some applications this can be a real problem
p38538
aVIn others maybe not
p38539
aVYou want to track the VM size over time and any profiler will do this
p38540
aVVisualVM ships with Java 6u14 (iirc) or higher and it'll do it
p38541
aVIf you watch your application over time you'll see the amount of memory go up and then drop suddenly as temporary objects are garbage collected forming a "saw" pattern
p38542
aVNow over time that may go up (ie the overall slope is up)
p38543
aVThis may or may not indicate a problem
p38544
aVIt could indicate you're leaking memory
p38545
aVIt could mean you're holding references onto objects you simply don't need to so they aren't being GCed
p38546
aVOr it could be no problem at all
p38547
aVIt depends on what you're application is doing
p38548
aVIf, for example, you're caching a larger and larger amount of data in memory as time goes on then this may not be a leak at all but it might indicate an architectural problem in that you're not flushing caches
p38549

aV5GB however is not a lot of memory so just having your VM that size in and of itself is no reason for you having to restart it every day

p38676

p38678
aVis there simply for correct minimal value checks
p38679
aVThe second part is the key part of the algorithm
p38680
aVIt looks at the distance between two points (i,k) comparing it to the distance of (i,j) + (j,K) for all vertices j
p38681
aVIf the indirect path is less it is substituted into the matrix as the shortest path and so on
p38682
aVThe result of this algorithm on the above (very simple) graph is:
p38683
aVWhat this tells you is the shortest distance between any pair of vertices
p38684
aVNote: I've seeded the result of (i,i) to 0 as you can argue the distance of any node to itself is 0
p38685
aVYou can take out that assumption easily enough, yielding this result:
p38686
aVSo node 3 to itself is a distance of 6 as it traverses 3->1->3 as the shortest path
p38687
aVThis would get a lot more interesting in a directed graph, which Floyd's can handle
p38688
aVFloyd's is an O(n3) algorithm
p38689
aVIt won't reconstruct the actual path between each pair of points, just the total distance (weight)

aVYou can use Dijkstra's algorithm between each vertex pair to construct the actual paths, which interestingly enough is also O(n3) but tends to be slower in real world usage as the calculations of Floyd's are pretty simple

aVYour algorithm uses an adjacency list instead of a matrix to implement this algorithm, which confuses the issue slightly

VJava projects rarely use make and makefiles
p38880
aVIn fact, I've only ever seen this used once in practice however and that was 13 years ago, predating Java build tools
p38881
aVInstead Java projects use one of the two leading build tools
p38882
aVBased on your question I'm going to assume you have no particular reason to use make (in that you're not trying to compile an existing project that only has a Makefile)
p38883
aVAnt
p38884
aVAnt is an XML-based scripting build tool that bears a little (but not a lot) similarity to a makefile in concept
p38885
aVAn Ant build script will define a number of tasks
p38886
aVThose tasks will depend on other tasks
p38887
aVThe tasks can include compiling Java source files, building jars and anything you like really
p38888
aVAnt is very flexible but also you end up writing a bunch of boilerplate over and over (between projects)
p38889
aVNo two moderately complex Ant projects are the same and dependencies can become a huge problem
p38890
aVBy "dependencies" I'm not talking about source dependencies but dependencies on third-party libraries
p38891
aVAnt has another tool called Ivy for managing dependencies
p38892
aVMaven
p38893
aVMaven is the other common build tool
p38894
aVMaven differs greatly from Ant in that Maven defines project types (archetypes) such as a Web application
p38895
aVWhen you choose one (or more) archetype for your project, it mandates a directory structure that is quite deep
p38896
aVFor example:
p38897
aVNow some people don't like this, in part because some people just don't like being told what to do (imho) but also for things like legacy reasons and other factors
p38898
aVPersonally I consider it a good thing because once you're familiar with any Maven Web application project, you can go to any other Maven Web application project and find your way around
p38899
aVMaven will also give you lots of standard commands to run, such as compile, test, install, etc
p38900
aVMaven is also useful for dependencies on third-party libraries
p38901
aVYou declare these in your Maven project file and they are retrieved from repositories on the internet (and cached locally unless you set it up otherwise)
p38902
aVSo my advice is use one of these two
p38903
aVYou may be used to Makefiles if you come from a C/C++ background but it isn't really the Java way

VCompressing on the fly is easy
p38958
aVThe problem you're going to have is resuming the upload
p38959
aVThat basically eliminates HTTP as a transport so you'll need to look at something like (S)FTP or SCP
p38960
aVEven there the problem is you're not creating a file on the client so what's going to be resumed
p38961
aVIn the very least you will need to use a compression method that is deterministic (meaning that given a specified file, any two runs of the compression algorithm will produce exactly the same output)
p38962
aVIf this isn't true, you can't resume at all
p38963
aVMy advice is to take a slightly tangential approach
p38964
aVDivide the file into manageable chunks (say 50MB)
p38965
aVThat is deterministic
p38966
aVCompress each chunk individually
p38967
aVIf a chunk fails, resend it
p38968
aVThere is no resumption but you can get partial uploads by the server telling the client what chunks its received or waiting for
p38969
aVOne problem you'll have is identifying a particular file
p38970
aVWill the file name do
p38971
aVIs there some other identifying characteristic
p38972
aVIf two clients try and upload the same file will the server be able to detect this
p38973
aVThe standard approach for this kind of thing is to use a checksum (SHA1 hash of the file contents) but you don't want to read a 16GB file in its entirety just to do a checksum
p38974
aVSo some other method would be preferable
p38975
aVImagine the network communication goes something like this:
p38976
aVThis method will also handle multiple clients uploading the file at the same time as the server can ask for different chunks from different clients and merge them together
p38977
aVThe one problem with this method is the file isn't "complete" on the server (as a zip or tarball) but I think you need to give that up to end up with something that'll actually work and not be a nightmare to code

VCheck every element against every other element
p38984
aVThe naive solution is to check every element against every other element
p38985
aVThis is wasteful and yields an O(n2) solution, even if you only go "forward"
p38986
aVSort then remove duplicates
p38987
aVA better solution is sort the array and then check each element to the one next to it to find duplicates
p38988
aVChoose an efficient sort and this is O(n log n)
p38989
aVThe disadvantage with the sort-based solution is order is not maintained
p38990
aVAn extra step can take care of this however
p38991
aVPut all entries (in the unique sorted array) into a hashtable, which has O(1) access
p38992
aVThen iterate over the original array
p38993
aVFor each element, check if it is in the hash table
p38994
aVIf it is, add it to the result and delete it from the hash table
p38995
aVYou will end up with a resultant array that has the order of the original with each element being in the same position as its first occurrence
p38996
aVLinear sorts of integers
p38997
aVIf you're dealing with integers of some fixed range you can do even better by using a radix sort
p38998
aVIf you assume the numbers are all in the range of 0 to 1,000,000 for example, you can allocate a bit vector of some 1,000,001
p38999
aVFor each element in the original array, you set the corresponding bit based on its value (eg a value of 13 results in setting the 14th bit)
p39000
aVThen traverse the original array, check if it is in the bit vector
p39001
aVIf it is, add it to the result array and clear that bit from the bit vector
p39002
aVThis is O(n) and trades space for time
p39003
aVHash table solution
p39004
aVWhich leads us to the best solution of all: the sort is actually a distraction, though useful
p39005
aVCreate a hashtable with O(1) access
p39006
aVTraverse the original list
p39007
aVIf it is not in the hashtable already, add it to the result array and add it to the hash table
p39008
aVIf it is in the hash table, ignore it
p39009
aVThis is by far the best solution
p39010
aVSo why the rest
p39011
aVBecause problems like this are about adapting knowledge you have (or should have) to problems and refining them based on the assumptions you make into a solution
p39012
aVEvolving a solution and understanding the thinking behind it is far more useful than regurgitating a solution
p39013
aVAlso, hash tables are not always available
p39014
aVTake an embedded system or something where space is VERY limited

p39030
aVThis is with a small table too
p39031
aVThe reason that it's recommended you put scripts at the bottom is the way script loading works in HTML

p39033
aVIf that script is at the bottom, the page is already loaded so the user can see something

p39070
aVThe last table is often called a join table and facilitates a many-to-many relationship between Posts and Tags
p39071
aVBasically, think of a many-to-many relationship as two one-to-many relationships, because that's how they're implemented in normal RDBMSs
p39072
aVSo the above query has a one-to-many join from Posts to PostTags and another from Tags to PostTags
p39073
aVThe PostTags table I created has a composite primary key, being

aVUpdate: added a test of both character-by-character and buffered reading

p39114

p39310
aVNo need for a recursive regex
p39311
aVBy the way, recursive regex is a contradiction in terms
p39312
aVAs a regular language (which a regex parses) can't be recursive, by definition
p39313
aVIf you want to also group the characters in pairs with colons in between, ignoring the two hex characters for a second, use:
p39314
aVNow if you want to add the condition requiring tow hex characters, use a positive lookahead:
p39315
aVTo explain how this works, the first thing it does it that it checks (with a positive lookahead ie  that you have zero or more digits or colons followed by a hex letter followed by zero or more digits or colons and then a letter
p39316
aVThis will ensure there will be two hex letters in the expression
p39317
aVAfter the positive lookahead is the original expression that makes sure the string is pairs of hex digits

VThere are two possible answers here
p39428
aVThe first is that you are waiting for a button press in a Swing application (or similar)
p39429
aVIf so, threads aren't the answer
p39430
aVYou should simply be using an action listener:
p39431
aVYou need to be really careful about using threads in Swing applications
p39432
aVThat's because only one thread (called the Event Dispatching Thread or EDT) is the only thread allowed to make UI updates
p39433
aVAll event handlers occur in the EDT
p39434
aVSo while code is running on the EDT no UI updates will happen (moving/closing windows, pressing buttons, etc) so EDT code should be short-lived
p39435
aVThe more general problem can be solved in a number of ways that depend on more information than is provided
p39436
aVFirstly, to answer your question: your CPU usage is going to 100% because the threads are constantly checking the value and calling a function in an endless loop
p39437
aVYou should be using the Java 5+ concurrency model however, which will look something more like this:
p39438
aVAs to how to do the inter-thread communication, that's where it gets tricky
p39439
aVYou're sharing a primitive variable, which is a really bad idea
p39440
aVThe simplest idiom is to use wait-notify:
p39441
aVThe  mutexes are really important
p39442
aVBut Java 5 adds a whole bunch of alternatives to this

VThe key to solving this problem is first making an observation: the center of the largest circle that will fit inside an arbitrary polygon is the point that is:
p39476
aVInside the polygon; and
p39477
aVFurthest from any point on the edges of the polygon
p39478
aVWhy
p39479
aVBecause every point on the edge of a circle is equidistant from that center
p39480
aVBy definition, the largest circle will have the largest radius and will touch the polygon on at least two points so if you find the point inside furthest from the polygon you've found the center of the circle
p39481
aVThis problem appears in geography and is solved iteratively to any arbitrary precision
p39482
aVIts called the Poles of Inaccessibility problem
p39483
aVSee Poles of Inaccessibility: A Calculation Algorithm for the Remotest Places on Earth
p39484
aVThe basic algorithm works like this:
p39485
aVDefine R as a rectilinear region from (xmin,ymin) to (xmax,ymax);
p39486
aVDivide R into an arbitrary number of points
p39487
aVThe paper uses 21 as a heuristic (meaning divide the height and width by 20);
p39488
aVClip and points that are outside the polygon;
p39489
aVFor the remainder find the point that is furthest from any point on the edge;
p39490
aVFrom the point define a new R with smaller intervals and bounds and repeat from step 2 to get to any arbitrary precision answer
p39491
aVThe paper reduces R by a factor of the square root of 2
p39492
aVOne note: testing if a point is inside the polygon or not
p39493
aVThe simplest solution to this part of the problem is to cast a ray to the right of the point
p39494
aVIf it crosses an odd number of edges, it's within the polygon
p39495
aVIf it's an even number, it's outside
p39496
aVAlso, as far as testing the distance to any edge there are two cases you need to consider:
p39497
aVThe point is perpendicular to a point on that edge (within the bounds of the two vertices); or
p39498
aVIt isn't
p39499
aV(2) is easy
p39500
aVThe distance to the edge is the minimum of the distances to the two vertices
p39501
aVFor (1), the closest point on that edge will be the point that intersects the edge at a 90 degree angle starting from the point you're testing
