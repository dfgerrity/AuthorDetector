aVA warning should be for something which is allowed, but quite likely isn't what the author intended
p6
aVFor example, the W3C Markup Validator will warn about the use of the syntax  in an HTML document
p7
aVIn XHTML this means "A line break", but in an HTML document, while being allowed, actually means "A line break followed by a greater than sign" (even if most browsers don't respect this)

p640

aVSince different browsers handle events in different ways (I'm looking at Internet Explorer), I generally use an abstraction layer such as YUI or jQuery to normalise the differences

Vimg tags do not need to be closed in HTML,
p1584
aVand that makes sense to me
p1585
aVNo tag needs to be closed
p1586
aVAll elements need to be closed
p1587
aVMost elements consist of a start tag, some content, and an end tag
p1588
aVSince an image element cannot have content, the end tag is not needed
p1589
aVIn HTML, elements which cannot have content ("EMPTY elements") have the end tags forbidden
p1590
aVBut in XHTML, img tags require a close tag which seems kind of funky
p1591
aVXHTML is an XML application rather than an SGML application, and XML doesn't have all the features that SGML does \u2014 including the ability to specify that an end tag is forbidden
p1592
aVI just think it's weird to have a pair of open and close tags with nothing in between
p1593
aVXML introduces a new kind of tag \u2014 a self-closing tag () which acts as a start and end tag combined
p1594
aVIf you are writing HTML-Compatible XHTML (which you should be if you choose to use XHTML and want to support browsers which don't support that language \u2014 such as Internet Explorer), then you should use that syntax
p1595
aV(I prefer to stick to HTML myself)
p1596
aVp tags (as in paragraph) do not need to be closed in HTML, and that is funky to me
p1597
aVMany elements in HTML have optional end tags
p1598
aVThis allows the end tag to be omitted when it can be implied
p1599
aVFor example:
p1600
aVSince a p element cannot contain another p element, you can imply (with 100% reliability) that starting a new paragraph will close the previous one
p1601

p1617
aVScripts and styles \u2014 you need to use character references or CDATA markers if you use certain characters in your embedded JS and CSS in XHTML, but these elements are marked as CDATA in the DTD for HTML, so this would be wrong there \u2026 but you shouldn't use embedded scripts or styles anyway

aVWhile you could use PHP to write data that JavaScript could read, and then use that to dynamically add an HTML class (there is no such thing as a CSS class) that would match a CSS selector to apply a rule to hide some data\u2026
p3623

VSince PHP runs on the webserver, and buttons (and JavaScript in this case) appear on the client, you have to make an HTTP request to the server
p3630
aVThe easiest way to do this is to use a form
p3631
aVNo JavaScript is required
p3632
aVYou can add JavaScript (although it should be layered on top of a working non-JS version)
p3633
aVUsing JavaScript to make an HTTP request without leaving the page is known as Ajax, and generally achieved with the XMLHttpRequest object

p4737
aVThe element you are trying to find by its id doesn't have an id
p4738
aVIt has only a class
p4739
aVYou need to give the element you are trying to match an id and pass a string instead of an undefined value
p4740
aVThen the lesser issues
p4741
aVYou are testing the inline display style property, but you aren't setting it by default
p4742
aVAs a rule of thumb, it is better to twiddle the  property, and have your styles defined in a stylesheet
p4743
aVYou are using a javascript pseudo-URI instead of progressive enhancement
p4744

aVThe use of Ajax (in of itself) doesn't stop you constructing a the form data manually and submitting it as normal

p7127
aVThe advantage of using XHTML over HTML is that you can mix different markup languages into one document, so (for example) you could have an XHTML+SVG+MathML document

p14415
aVAs far as JavaScript is concerned a bunch of form controls with the same name are just a bunch of form controls with the same name, and form controls with names that include square brackets are just form controls with names that include square brackets

aVSince the name of the form controls includes square brackets,  you can't use dot notation and have to use square bracket notation
p14421

p15627
aVStops the other hacks from interfering with each other
p15628
aVFrankly, you can (and should) forget about browsers which don't understand  (note, this is not the same as not supporting JS, it means not recognizing the element at all so treating it (effectively) as a )
p15629
aVIf you do that and use XHTML then you can just use CDATA flags prefixed with JS comments (  )
p15630
aVYou should generally also avoid XHTML
p15631
aVUnless you are dealing with a server side system that insists of generating XHTML and it is more effort to convert it to HTML then it is to deal with all the issues of writing HTML-Compatible XHTML, then XHTML is almost never worth the cost
p15632
aVIf you aren't using XHTML or caring about browsers which don't even speak HTTP 1
p15633
aV1, then you just need the script tags and the script, without any wrappers at all
p15634

VAjax is, in short, the process of communicating with a webserver from a page, using JavaScript, without leaving the page
p15950
aVThe key things you need to know for this are:
p15951
aVThe JavaScript needed to make the request and handle the response
p15952
aVThe server side code needed to receive the request and make the response (unless you are using a service that provides this for you)
p15953
aVThe server side of this depends very much on what server side environment you are working with, so there is little useful that is specific that could be said
p15954
aVWhat can be usually said are what form the responses can take
p15955
aVJSON is a popular approach for sending structured data
p15956
aVXML is another way to send structured data, but has been falling out of favour of late since JSON is, arguably, easier to work with
p15957
aVChunks of HTML are popular for shoving into pages with
p15958
aVTiny bits of plain text are useful for simple responses
p15959
aVAs for the client side, there are two common approaches
p15960
aVXMLHttpRequest, which is powerful, but limited to requests to the current domain by the same origin policy
p15961
aVJSON-P, a cross-domain method that works by loading a script from the third party that calls a function defined by the first party with all the data in an argument to the call
p15962
aVNow for some resources:
p15963
aVThe W3C provides a good guide to JavaScript and other web standards (originally organised by Opera but migrated in the last few years) if you need some background

VYou've made a couple of different attempts to get the data here, and they fail for different reasons
p18725
aVI'll explain why in a moment, first though \u2014 the solution:
p18726
aVWhatever you do with the data has to be done in the callback function
p18727
aVNow, why your attempts don't work:
p18728
aVYou can't return data from an Ajax request
p18729
aVAjax works (usually) by creating an XHR object, setting an event handler for "When the request comes back", and then sending an HTTP request
p18730
aVYou can't return data from it for the same reason that you can't get the event object returned from:
p18731
aVYou can't set the value of a variable called  and defined outside a function from inside a function that defines  using the  keyword
p18732
aVThe  keyword creates a new instance of the variable that is scoped to the function
p18733
aVIf you took the  away from the callback function, it still wouldn't work because you would have timing issues
p18734
aVIf you had:
p18735
aVThen you would be alerting  because the click hasn't taken place when the  is called, so the variable hasn't been set by the event handling function
p18736
aVWith Ajax, the HTTP request hasn't been answered by the time the alert is reached, so it is also undefined
p18737
aVWhich brings us back to: Whatever you do with the data has to be done in the callback function
p18738
aVThe point of the callback function is that it is called when the data is ready
p18739
aVSo whatever you do with the data can be done then

aVAll that said, in this case, there doesn't seem to be any reason to use JavaScript in the first place and you would be better off moving all the logic to PHP
p19558
aVIncidentally, your choice of Doctype will trigger Quirks mode in most browsers

VThey are exactly the same as the risks of validating with pure client side JavaScript
p19568
aVThe only difference is that you are asking the server for some data as part of the process
p19569
aVThe user can override the JavaScript to submit the form no matter what the validation outcome is
p19570
aVThe only reason to use JavaScript at all when checking data for submission is to save the user time
p19571
aVIf as part of that you want to do something such as asking the server if a username is taken while the user fills out the rest of the form, then great \u2014 that is quite a nice use of Ajax
p19572
aVOtherwise, using Ajax is pretty worthless
p19573
aVIf you want to do client side checking, then put all the logic you can for it on the client and avoid making HTTP requests
p19574
aVIf you have things that can only be checked server side (because they are based on data, like the example with usernames that are already taken) then consider using Ajax for that
p19575
aVThe client side check is the convenience check
p19576
aVAlways do the security check server side and on the final submitted data
p19577
aVNote that validating data that is actually submitted using Ajax is a different matter \u2014 since that is the final submitted data
p19578
aVIt is doing Ajax validation as a precursor to the final submission that doesn't add any trust to the data

aVIf you are writing it from scratch then you'll need the specification for SMTP

aVSMTP servers are hard to write, and there are several really good open source solutions out there

p24767
aVThan I want to use PHP to program the way the mails are shown to the users
p24768
aVServers that receive mails do not typically show them to users
p24769
aVThey usually store them in a standard way (such as Maildir or mbox) which other software (such as a local email client or an IMAP server) accesses
p24770
aVThe job of showing email to a user is belongs to email clients
p24771

aVHowever, there is no way to specify that a content image (and icons that don't decorate text are content images) is just part of a larger file
p27205
aVYou have to use hacks involving background images
p27206
aVThis breaks the separation of concerns around content and style and usually involves using semantically incorrect elements, and then requires further hackery to provide alternative content for users who can't see the image and that hackery rarely does as good a job as an alt attribute

VNew answer based on updated question:

aVIt isn't the HTML 5 parsing rules you have a problem with, it is support for HTML 5 attributes
p27268
aVNo, you can't override this
p27269

p27270
aVOriginal answer:
p27271
aVNo, there isn't
p27272
aVThe HTML 5 parsing rules are mostly "What browsers have been doing for the last decade and a half anyway"

aVThus you don't need to worry about testing them to achieve this

aVYou are delivering an HTML document with an reference to an image in it

aV(Assuming you are using utf-8, which you should be)

aVYour Doctype is missing

aVThis will trigger quirks mode, which is undesirable
p30905
aVYou also have a great deal of legacy presentational markup that should be replaced by CSS
p30906
aVThe context suggests that the image is decorative, so the alternative text should probably be  (see Alt texts in IMGS), but there is nothing wrong with the actual reference to the image
p30907
aVBut even-though the picture is in the same directory as my cgi script
p30908

p30909
aVYou need to check that the image is
p30910
aVCan you reach the image by typing the URL in directly
p30911
aVWhat do the web server logs say when you try
p30912
aVIt is possible that your server is configured to try to treat everything in the directory as an executable, no matter what the file extension, so it might be trying to run the image as if it were a CGI program (which will obviously fail)

p30945
aVA simplified version of the specification is available on the JSON homepage

p30947
aVLibraries exist in many different languages to convert from a string of JSON data into data structures appropriate for that language (and to go the other way)
p30948
aVA list of some of them can be found near the bottom of the JSON homepage
p30949
aVAn array is a data structure common to most programming languages which contains a number of variables in a specific order
p30950
aVJSON has an array data type
p30951
aVA JSON Object is a serialisation of a collection of key/value pairs
p30952
aVMost programming languages have a matching data structure, such as a hash in Perl or a (simple) object in JavaScript
p30953
aVIn the page you link to, there is no mention of JSON
p30954
aVIt has a variable () to which is assigned a simple object (using an object literal ) which has one key () to which is assigned an array (using an array literal ) that contains a number of objects, each of which consists of a bunch of key/value pairs where the values are all strings
p30955
aVIf you were to remove the first line, and the semi-colon at the end, then the example would be a JSON data structure representing the same information

aVFor all practical purposes, if you are writing webpages for the WWW, then the only language you can use in an HTML  is JavaScript
p31483
aVIf you want to run it on the web server, then you need to get your HTTPD to run the script in response to a URL being requested from it

aVyou can add elements to the document to display a message

p32267
aVwhich i can simply do with server side programming also,without using any function
p32268
aVWith server side programming, you can modify the document you are sending to the client, but only at load time, and you don't have access to things like the  method

p32274
aVClient side programming, on the other hand, can be used to make things more convenient for the user

aVIf you were doing this manually, you would have to loop over each radio button in the group until you found one that was checked (or use a selector that matched only the checked ratio button ())

p42408
aVIf you want to send a JavaScript object then you have to serialise it to a string and deserialise it at the other end
p42409
aVThere is no sane way to represent an HTMLElementNode (or a jQuery object that wraps on) in that process (not least because PHP doesn't usually represent HTML in a DOM and when it does it won't be the same DOM instance as the browser is using)
p42410
aVUsually in this type of situation, you would request some data from PHP (possibly using one of jQuery's ajax methods) and then use JavaScript to turn it into DOM elements and insert it into the document

aVServer side programming at runtime (which allows for quick updates to templates but needs server support)
p46430
aVSomething at build time (which simplifies cache control and doesn't require anything to run on the server)

aVThe two basic approaches to this are includes (simple) and full template systems (powerful)

aVAn entity reference was found in the document, but there is no reference by that name defined
p51958
aVOften this is caused by misspelling the reference name, unencoded ampersands, or by leaving off the trailing semicolon ()

p51960
aVEntity references start with an ampersand () and end with a semicolon ()
p51961
aVIf you want to use a literal ampersand in your document you must encode it as "" (even inside URLs
p51962
