VWhat you assume is right, in a single target/thread environment there's little difference
p282
aVHowever if you look at the cache providers there is a bit going on even in a multi-threaded scenario
p283
aVHow an object is re-cached from it's modified state is different in the non-strict
p284
aVFor example, if your object is much heftier to reload but you'd like it to after an update instead of footing the next user with the bill, then you'll see different performance with strict vs non-strict
p285
aVFor example: non-strict simply dumps an object from cache after an update is performed
p286
aVprice is paid for the fetch on the next access instead of a post-update event handler
p287
aVIn the strict model, the re-cache is taken care of automatically
p288
aVA similar thing happens with inserts, non-strict will do nothing where strict will go behind and load the newly inserted object into cache
p289
aVIn non-strict you also have the possibility of a dirty read, since the cache isn't locked at the time of the read you would not see the result of another thread's change to the item
p290
aVIn strict the cache key for that item would lock and you would be held up but see the absolute latest result
p291
aVSo, even in a single target environment, if there is a large amount of concurrent reads/edits on objects then you have a chance to see data that isn't really accurate
p292
aVThis of course becomes a problem when a save is performed and an edit screen is loading:  the person thinking they're editing the latest version of the object really isn't, and they're in for a nasty surprise when they try to save the edits to the stale data they loaded

aVNet Connector which supports most everything simple
p503
aVIt's not very mature yet so something very complex you may have issues on, but it should do most of what you want through Entity Framework
p504
aVWith Entity Framework yes you can do updates, it's LINQ-to-SQL that doesn't update against any other databases (unless you use a third party provider like DotConnect)
p505
aVSQLite is one alternative, but since multiple threads against it can cause major issues with it's operation, so if you need a major data store I'd go SQLExpress or MySQL

aVScott Guthrie posted a few tips on speeing compiles up in VS 2005, you didn't specify which version you were on, but the same speed tips apply
p563
aVThe second section of his post is specific to Web Site projects
p564
aVOne other tip would be if you're working on pages and not code actually in the  directory, there is a build option that may be useful
p565
aVGo to Project Properties > Build > Change Before running startup page from Build Web Site to Build Page, this will build only the startup page when you fire up the debugger
p566
aVI'm not sure if this scenario happens often, but if most of your work happens in the pages and not in , this will save you lots of compile time
p567
aVApp_Code has to be built together, you should avoid having your codebehinds, etc in there
p568
aVEverything that can be elsewhere should be
p569
aVJust a note:  the compilation time, at least in debug, is usually around 30-50x faster in a Web Application
p570
aVThat being said, you have to recompile the entire application every code change so there are drawbacks
p571
aVbut with namespace changes and such, I understand the strain patches would put on you
p572
aVAlso, keep in mind that when you split code into other projects, besides being simpler all-around in terms of compile, Visual Studio will not need to compile those other dependency projects unless they have changed
p573
aVAs it stands right now, everything is fair game because anything in your project that can change can possibly affect anything else in there
p574
aVhowever if you split it up, Visual Studio will only compile your other projects when either they change or a project they reference gets rebuilt

VUpdate based on comments:
p596
aVShort version: It doesn't matter much, but it may depend on what they host
p597
aVThey all host different things:  Google doesn't host jQuery
p598
aVValidate, Microsoft doesn't host jQuery-UI, Microsoft offers their scripts that would otherwise be served via  and an easier integration (e

p602
aVImportant Note:  If you're building an intranet application, stay away from the CDN approach
p603
aVIt doesn't matter who's hosting it, unless you're on a very overloaded server internally, no CDN will give you more performance than local 100mb/1GB ethernet will
p604
aVIf you use a CDN for a strictly internal application you're hurting performance
p605
aVSet your cache expiration headers correctly and ignore CDNs exist in the intranet-only scenario
p606
aVThe chances of either being blocked seems to be about equal, almost zero
p607
aVI have worked on contracts where this isn't true, but it seems to be an exception
p608
aVAlso, since the original posting of this answer, the context surrounding it has changed greatly, the Microsoft CDN has made a lot of progress
p609
aVThe project I'm currently on uses both CDNs which works best for our solution
p610
aVSeveral factors play into this
p611
aVUsers with an older browser are still probably making 2 simultaneous requests per domain as recommended by the HTTP specification
p612
aVThis isn't an issue for anyone running anything decently new that supports pipelining (every current browser), but based on another factor we're knocking out this limitation as well, at least as far as the javascript
p613
aVGoogle's CDN we're using for:

p616

aV6190 (Major

p640
aVSince part of our build process is combining and minifying all custom javascript, we do this via a custom script manager that includes the release or debug (non-minified) versions of these scripts depending on the build
p641
aVSince Google doesn't host the jQuery validation package, this can be a down-side
p642
aVMVC is including/using this in their 2
p643
aV0 release, so you could rely completely on Microsoft's CDN for all your needs, and all of it automatic via the ScriptManager
p644
aVThe only other argument to be made would be DNS times, there is a cost to this in terms of page load speed
p645
aVOn Average: Simply because it's used more (it's been around longer)  is likely to be returned by DNS sooner than , simply because the local DNS server was more likely to get a request for it (this is a first user in the area penalty)
p646
aVThis is a very minor thing and should only be considered if performance is extremely important, down to the millisecond
p647
aV(Yes: I realize this point is contrary to my using both CDNs, but in our case the DNS time is far overshadowed by the wait time on the javascript/blocking that occurs)
p648
aVLast, if you haven't looked at it, one of the best tools out there is Firebug, and some plug-ins for it: Page Speed and YSlow
p649
aVIf you use a CDN but your pages are requesting images every time because of no cache-headers, you're missing the low-hanging fruit
p650
aVFirebug's Net panel can quickly give you a quick breakdown of your page load-time, and Page Speed/YSlow can offer some good suggestions to help

p695
aVThere's no need for  at all, just using fields off the table works, for example:
p696
aVThis correctly performs a single left outer join to the related  and  tables
p697
aVNow the fix is specific to the situation here of getting this anonymous type
p698
aVbut they also fixed the  behavior where we do need it, correctly keyed off the foreign key type now
p699
aVHope this update helps others on an older version
p700
aVI highly recommend upgrading, there are lots of new enhancements in versions since 5
p701

p702
aVOriginal:
p703

p704
aVThis may be specific behavior to the devart: dotConnect for Oracle provider (as of version 5
p705
aV35
p706
aV62, if this behavior changes I'll try and update this question)
p707
aVThis results in a single query
p708
aVWhile calling a child object in the select, e
p709
ag224
aVdoes not cause a join to occur (resulting in a lot of  lazy loads, one per row of tabular data we're displaying), calling a property on it however, e
p710
ag224
aVDOES cause a correct left join in the address table in the query query
p711
aVThe linq above works only in linq-to-sql, it would fail with null reference on linq-to-entities, but
p712
aVin the case we're dealing with that's fine
p713
aVThe good:
p714
aVSingle query, producing left joins to Address and Email
p715
aVLightweight objects for address and down to just a string for email (they both have some back-reference EntiySet in the real project, making them more expensive than necessary for simple tabular display needs)
p716
aVFast/clean, the above is a much simpler query than manually joining every child table we were doing, cleaner code
p717
aVPerformance, the creation of the heavier objects was quite a hit, changing from Email to string, Address to AddressLite and (in the full project) Phone to PhoneLite resulted in pages just displaying tabular data going from 300-500ms down to 50-100ms
p718
aVThe Bad:
p719
aVAnonymous type, there are cases where we need a strong type, having to create those (even as quick as ReSharper makes this task) adds a lot of clutter
p720
aVSince we can't modify and save an anonymous type, or any type we create without a good deal of annotation work, which must be updated if the model changes anything around that

p901
aVthis should result in a much snappier Visual Studio

p903
aVSomething else you can do is edit the build definition and remove any unmodified projects (depending on how you links are

p905
aVSolution -> Right Click -> Configuration Manager -> uncheck Build on any projects that don't change and aren't needed every build for some other reason
p906
aVThis speeds up your build by using the output of the last build of these projects, from wherever they dump their binaries to
p907
aVNote: You can still right click a project and build to update it's output then rebuild the solution to get the latest
p908
aVyou can do this instead of changing the build configuration back and forth to include it

p910
aVIn the spirit of going the performance route (e
p911
ag224
aVwaiting until VS 2010 really), have you taken the measures listed in some other stack overflow questions: Very slow compile times on Visual Studio and Visual Studio Optimizations
p912
aVThese can make quite a difference, and may bring performance to an acceptable level while we wait on VS 2010 to ship
p913
aVA few more things that can have a good impact on performance:
p914
aVI highly recommend an SSD if it's an option
p915
aVThey are costly but definitely worth it, the more files in your solution they more they pay off
p916
aVWhen we ordered new machines at work the entire development team went with SSDs, the difference is astounding
p917
aVWhen you're dealing with a large solution, it's spinning the drive around switching the physical head to thousands of locations just to read the files in
p918
aVthat's where SSDs win, seek time is effectively 0ms
p919
aVAlong the same lines, a free solution is a good drafragmenter (only if you're on a physical, do NOT defrag a SSD) makes a big difference
p920
aVif you use something that's keeping visual studio in mind
p921
aVI recommend MyDefrag (freeware) as it's native algorithm for defragging keeps directory structure in mind, so at least a physical drive doesn't spend as much time switching around to steam the files you need in your solution, they're all very close on the disk
p922
aVWith the above SSD suggestion, keep in mind there is a huge disparity in SSD performance between a cheap and a fast drive, do a little bit of research here
p923
aVDon't worry about your system, with a free utility such as gParted you can move your entire OS drive over very easily, and your old drive will still be a backup
p924
aVas long as the SSD can fit the data off your C, you're good

p995
aVEntity Framework 4
p996
aV0 has new features, the object tracking improvements alone may mean huge wins since you're not doing that manual work yourself
p997
aVin any case, at least the development's faster
p998
aVIf it didn't work at all before, lighter weight objects with POCO support may mean a lot less memory being shifted when dealing with lots of objects as well
p999
aVNo matter how small the cost of extra properties being populated when fetching from the DB, there is a cost both in instantiating and tracking them (load time and memory consumption)
p1000
aVIn your specific case, a half second is a long time for anything but a very complex or high volume query
p1001
aVhave you looked to see how much time is spent in the database and how much time is spent once
p1002
aVNet has the data
p1003
aVIf you're spending most of your time outside of SQL then yes, the base improvements in reflections in Net 4
p1004
aV0 should provide you some speed improvement
p1005

VThis is how CSS works according to W3C:
p2117
aVIn this specification, the expression collapsing margins means that adjoining margins (no non-empty content, padding, or border areas, or clearance separate them) of two or more boxes (which may be next to one another or nested) combine to form a single margin
p2118
aVMore specific to your case of the top div:
p2119
aVIf the top and bottom margins of a box are adjoining, then it is possible for margins to collapse through it
p2120
aVIn this case, the position of the element depends on its relationship with the other elements whose margins are being collapsed
p2121
aVIf the element's margins are collapsed with its parent's top margin, the top border edge of the box is defined to be the same as the parent's
p2122
aVOtherwise, either the element's parent is not taking part in the margin collapsing, or only the parent's bottom margin is involved
p2123
aVThe position of the element's top border edge is the same as it would have been if the element had a non-zero bottom border

aVIt's easier if you picture how the index must be traversed across, column 1, then column 2, etc

aVyou see that lopping off most of the results in the fist pass makes the 2nd step that much faster
p4116
aVAnother case, if you queried on column 3, the optimizer wouldn't even use the index, because it's not helpful at all in narrowing down the result sets
p4117
aVAnytime you're in a query, narrowing down the number of results to deal with before the next step means better performance

VUnless you are databinding the container the SqlDataSource is in, the  syntax won't work (because that's binding syntax, and the property is never bound), so your issue is that the ConnectionString property just isn't getting set at all

p4545
aVFor the code behind:
p4546
aVOne more option is, if you use the same connection in tons of places, just make a control that inherits from SqlDataSource and override the ConnectionString property, set it only in that getter/setter and just use that control everywhere instead

VI'm doing option 1 currently, it's very lightweight and all you need is an ajax post (jQuery or UpdatePanel) and some modal (I'm using jQery UI)
p4616
aVIt's easier than a full page post, plus you have the added benefit of being able to manipulate the page you're in as part of the result
p4617
aVFor example I have grids in the page, the editor is modal, usually with more detail, when you hit save, the grid is updated
p4618
aVI've put this in a generic template solution and it's very easy to work with, and is as light as webforms can be in that situation, so I'm all in favor of option 1
p4619
aVHere's an example approach, having your modal control inherit from UpdatePanel (code condensed for brevity):
p4620
aVIn javascript:
p4621
aVThen in your markup (Can't think of a better name than MyControls right now, sorry
p4622
ag659
aVIn you pages codebehind you can do:
p4623
aVFr your approach, I'd have a jQuery action that sets an input field and clicks a button in the modal, triggering the update panel to postback, and in that code that loads the details into whatever control is in the modal, just call  and it'll be on the screen when the update panel ajax request comes back
p4624
aVThe example above, using jQuery UI will have 2 buttons on the modal, one to close and do nothing, one to save, clicking that  inside the modal, and you can do whatever you want on then server, calling  if successful, or put an error message in the panel if validation fails, just don't call  and it'll stay up for the user after the postback

aVA view-state MAC is an encrypted version of the hidden variable that a page's view state is persisted to when sent to the browser
p7344
aVIf true, the encrypted view state is checked to verify that it has not been tampered with on the client
p7345
aVDo not set EnableViewStateMac to true if performance is a key consideration
p7346
aVThat check has to do something, and something is more expensive than nothing
p7347
aVThe larger the viewstate you're dealing with, the more overhead this will put on your requests
p7348
aVThat being said, unless you're a really high traffic site or have really large viewstate in your pages, you probably won't notice a thing server-side
p7349
aVOn the client however, they will be getting a larger page, which will probably have more of an impact than anything
p7350
aVThat means they're uploading more to the server on postback

p7352
aVKeep in mind just how many things happens when the server executes a page, all of these options are "drop in the bucket" scenarios in most cases, there are of course exceptions

aVThe mouseleave event differs from mouseout in the way it handles event bubbling

p8761
aVThe C# compiler never ever does this sort of optimization; as noted, doing so would require that the compiler peer into the code being called and verify that the result it computes does not change over the lifetime of the callee's code

aVThe C# compiler does not do so

aVThe JIT compiler might
p8764
aVNo reason why it couldn't

aVIt has all the code sitting right there

aVIt is completely free to inline the property getter, and if the jitter determines that the inlined property getter returns a value that can be cached in a register and re-used, then it is free to do so

VUpdate: It looks like the internals of jQuery UI have changed dramatically since I answered this and firing the event no longer works
p9346
aVThere's no direct way to fire the event anymore because the resizable plugin has been fundamentally changed
p9347
aVIt resizes as the mouse is dragged rather than syncing items up at the end
p9348
aVThis happens by it listening for the internal  propagation event for resizable plugins which is now fired by the  handler
p9349
aVBut it depends on variables set along the way, so just firing that even internally won't help
p9350
aVThis means even overriding it is messy at best
p9351
aVI'd recommend just manually resizing the  elements directly, independent of the UI widget altogether if that's possible
p9352
aVBut for fun let's say it isn't
p9353
aVThe problem is that the internals of the plugin set various properties relating to previous and current mouse position in order to know how much to resize by
p9354
aVWe can abuse use that to add a method to the widget, like this:
p9355
aVThis is just creating the mouse events that the  widget is looking for and firing those
p9356
aVIf you wanted to do something like  it'd be an even simpler end since all we care about is the delta:
p9357
aVYou'd call the  method after jQuery UI and before creating your  instances and they'll all have a  method
p9358
aVThat part doesn't change, it's just:
p9359
aVThen to resize, you'd call that new  method like this:
p9360
aVThis would act as if you instantly dragged it to that size
p9361
aVThere are of course a few gotchas here:
p9362
aVThe  axis is assuming you want resize by the bottom right - I picked this because it's by far the most common scenario, but you could just make it a parameter
p9363
aVWe're hooking into the internal events a bit, but I'm intentionally using as few internal implementation details as possible, so that this is less likely to break in the future
p9364
aVIt could absolutely break in future versions of jQuery UI, I've only tried to minimize the chances of that
p9365
aVYou can play with it in action with a fiddle here and the  version here
p9366
aVOriginal answer:
p9367

V is object notation in JavaScript
p11498
aVFor example:
p11499
aVIn this case you're passing an object containing your settings to the plugin
p11500
aVThe plugin can deal with this as a object, whatever it's referenced as, for example:
p11501
aVOf course it has a lot more uses, but this is the most common example in jQuery
p11502
aVThe same is true for the , ,  functions, etc
p11503
aVAnything that takes properties generally uses this format
p11504
aVAs requested, some other examples:
p11505
aVAny object inside the passed object can be a function as well, not only properties, for example:
p11506
aVThis would set the focus event of that input to have an alert
p11507
aVAnother is extending an object, adding properties to it, like this:
p11508
aVNow  has the  property
p11509
aVThis is often used by plugins as well, to take the default settings, then merge any settings you passed in, overwriting with any settings you specified, using defaults for the rest
p11510
aVWhy are we using it
p11511
aVWell
p11512

VThe Why:
p11586
aVYour website (the managed portion, likely all of it non-third party) isn't compiled in 32 or 64-bit mode, at least not in the way you're thinking
p11587
aVThe difference is that (A version of Cassini) that visual studio uses for it's webserver is exclusively 32-bit
p11588
aVSo, it only loads 32-bit compatible DLLs
p11589
aVIIS on a 64 bit machine can run in either 32 or 64 bit mode (defaults to 64-bit), depending on the configuration settings, so it has no trouble loading up your application
p11590
aVSolution:
p11591
aVUnfortunately, there aren't a lot of options here, I asked the same question a while ago

aVthat's what the frameworks are for, to take care of these cross-browser differences for you
p11612
aVFor an example, look at the quirksmode DOM traversal page, according to it IE doesn't support most things
p11613
aVwhile true, the frameworks do, for example IE doesn't support , but in jQuery:  works to get this value, in every browser
p11614
aVYou'll find there's something in the library to handle 99% of the unsupported cases across browsers, at least with script
p11615
aVwith CSS you might have to move to plugins for the library, a common example of this is to get rounded corners working in IE
p11616
aVsince it has no CSS support for such
p11617
aVIf however you start doing things directly, like , then you're not in the library, you're doing javascript directly (it's all javascript, but you get the point :), and this might or might not cause issues, depending on how drunk the IE team was when implementing that particular function

p11911
aVit doesn't restrict the variable to this scope, it is available afterwards, here's a better example:
p11912
aVIf  was a closure to the element you're dealing with, then  would refer to the  object we passed into the with, but it doesn't :)
p11913
aVin this case is still the global context of
p11914
aVSince you're still executing in this context, any variables you define there will be available in that context, and therefore available later in the function, after the , because they're defined much higher in scope than you would think

aVIntuition tells you it's defined in a more constrained scope: within the

aVFor example: we leave it out of the pages here at Stack Overflow
p12549
aVIf you're using an HTML5 doctype then it's completely optional and defaults to , so you're absolutely fine leaving it off in every current (or even very old) browser
p12550
aVRealistically, this was also true even in HTML4 though not strictly valid HTML
p12551
aVFor an HTML4 doctype (to be valid), you need it
p12552
aVFor a browser to actually function, it's not strictly needed and will behave just fine (this has been true all the way back to Netscape 2) - but it won't be valid HTML

aVis now an empty set, good or bad

aVis now subject to much stricter parsing, good or bad

p12983
aV4+ only, that you could detect
p12984
aVso an engine that could determine the minimum version of jQuery your code could use may be possible

aVOther sites use google for hosting jQuery (you're on one now), if the user has been to any of those, they already have the file cached, meaning no request was made
p14516
aVYou can host all the files in one file, but you have to consider the weight of a few things with this:
p14517
aVHow large is that one file going to be, do you users need to download the entire thing again when you changed something in your script
p14518
aVAre the multiple requests (and DNS lookups) cheaper than the download time for that file
p14519
aVDo you pay for bandwidth

p14521
aVDepending on what percentage of the code is custom and how much is framework, Google's CDN can take a substantial part of your static js traffic off your server, leaving it available to serve and do other things (that's a huge benefit to a high traffic site), and when you change your script (much more common than a new framework release)

aVIn Safari on iPhone and iPad, the window size is set to the size of the screen (minus Safari user interface controls), and cannot be changed by the user

p14739
aVAs a user changes the zoom level and position of the viewport they are doing so within a viewable content area of fixed size (that is, the window)
p14740

VDisclaimer: This answer covers only the jQuery half of the question, as I have no experience with the Prototype autocomplete plugins, I'll leave that for someone with expertise to answer
p15021
aVFirst, I would stick with a plugin written in the framework you're already using, there's no need to switch from prototype to jquery or vice-versa for this
p15022
aVIf you're not already using a framework or are using jQuery, I'd suggest the jQuery UI autocomplete (different from the one you linked) mainly around the support and extensibility it offers and will offer
p15023
aVIt doesn't matter which framework you're looking at, once a plugin forms or gets pulled into any core library (jQuery UI in this case) it gets a wealth more support and the community more readily builds on it, making it better and more extensible
p15024
aVAlso if you run into trouble, you're more likely to find an answer to your problem
p15025

p15886
aVmost simple situations
p15887
aVBy "simple" I mostly mean that the result of one action doesn't affect the next
p15888
aVSomething to keep in mind most often is that some collections, for example our handy  is not thread safe, so using it in a parallel scenario isn't a good idea :)  Luckily there were concurrent collections added in
p15889
aVNET 4 that are thread safe
p15890

aVIt's important to note that the  method gets the attribute value for only the first element in the matched set
p16097
aVTo get the value for each element individually, we need to rely on a looping construct such as jQuery's  method

aVIf you use  the top line would look like this ( = ID of shared parent to all these links):

p16691

p17052
aVMsBuild Params:
p17053
aVRequirements:
p17054
aVYou need to install the MS Deploy Remote Agent Service on the destination web server, MSDeploy needs to be on the Build/Deployer server as well, but this should be the case by default
p17055
aVThe account you use in the params above needs admin access, at least to IIS
p17056
aVI'm not sure what the minimum permission requirements are
p17057
aVYou configure which WebSite/Virtual Directory the site goes to in the Web project you're deploying
p17058
aVPersonally I have a build configuration for each environment, this makes the builds very easy to handle and organize
p17059
aVFor example we have Release, Debug and Dev (there are more but for this example that's it)
p17060
aVOnly the Web project has a Dev configuration
p17061
aVTo do this, right click the solution, Configuration Manager
p17062
aV, On the web project click the configuration drop down, click New
p17063
aVGive it a name, "Dev" for this example, copy settings from debug or release, whatever matches closest to what your deployment server environment should be
p17064
aVMake sure "Create new solution configurations" is checked, it is by default
p17065
aVAfter creating this, change the configuration dropdown on the solution to the new Dev one, and Any CPU
p17066
aVmake sure your projects are all correct, I had some flipping to x86 and x64 randomly, not sure of the exact cause of that)
p17067
aVIn your web project, right click, properties
p17068
aVOn the left, click Package/Publish Web (you'll also want to mess with the other Package/Publish SQL tab, but I can't speak to that)
p17069
aVIn the options on the right click Create deployment package as a zip file
p17070
aVThe default location is fine, the next textbox I didn't find documented anywhere
p17071
aVThe format is this: WebSite/Virtual Directory, so if you have a site called "BuildSite" in IIS with no virtual directory (app == site root), you would have BuildSite only in this box
p17072
aVIf it was in a virtual directory, you might have Default Web Site/BuildVirtualDirectory
p17073
aVAfter you set all that, make sure to check-in the solution and web project so the build server has the configuration changes you made, then kick off a build :)

p17171
aVYou can see a demo here, only the first one fades with IE, other browsers will vary a bit (also depending on their version)

aVLet me cover the 2 packages you mentioned in comments here separately
p17665
aVjQuery Core is pretty small already, if you're using the minified version and serving it via gzip (and you should be doing this) then jquery is only 24kb (as of the current 1
p17666

p17667
aVjQuery UI however is a bit heftier, you can strip down to the effects and widgets you need by using their download manager here, just select the components you need, leave the rest off, and get a minified/stripped down version that you want

aVPart 2: Alternatives

VI recommend reading this for a good explanation of null storage: How does SQL Server really store NULL-s
p18496
aVIn short, the null/not null bit is stored in a different place, the null bitmap for the row
p18497
aVFrom the article:
p18498
aVEach row has a null bitmap for columns that allow nulls
p18499
aVIf the row in that column is null then a bit in the bitmap is 1 else it's 0
p18500
aVSo while the actual values for 8 bit columns are stored in 1 byte, there are extra bits in the row's null bitmap that indicate if that column is NULL or not
p18501
aVso depends on how you're counting
p18502

VBefore you read this, pull this list of events up in another page, the API itself is tremendously helpful, and all of what I'm discussing below is linked directly from this page
p18509
aVFirst,  is literally a shortcut for , they are equivalent
p18510
aVUse them when binding a handler directly to an element, like this:
p18511
aVIf this element gets replaced or thrown away, this handler won't be there anymore
p18512
aVAlso elements that weren't there when this code was run to attach the handler (e
p18513
ag224
aVthe selector found it then) won't get the handler
p18514
aVand  are similarly related,  actually uses  internally, they both listen for events to bubble
p18515
aVThis works for new and old elements, they bubble events the same way
p18516
aVYou use these when your elements may change, e
p18517
ag224
aVadding new rows, list items, etc
p18518
aVIf you don't have a parent/common ancestor that will stay in the page and not be replaced at any point, use , like this:
p18519
aVIf however you do have a parent element somewhere that isn't getting replaced (so its event handlers aren't going bye bye) you should handle it with , like this:
p18520
aVThis works almost the same as , but the event bubbles fewer times before being captured and the handlers executed
p18521
aVAnother common use of both of these is say your class changes on an element, no longer matching the selector you originally used
p18522
aVwith these methods the selector is evaluated at the time of the event, if it matches, the handler runs
p18523
aVso the element no longer matching the selector matters, it won't execute anymore
p18524
aVWith  however, the event handler is bound right on the DOM element, the fact that it doesn't match whatever selector was used to find it is irrelevant
p18525
aVthe event is bound and it's staying until that element is gone, or the handler is removed via
p18526
aVYet another common use for  and  is performance
p18527
aVIf you're dealing with lots of elements, attaching a click handler directly to each element is expensive and time consuming
p18528
aVIn these cases it's more economical to setup a single handler and let bubbling do the work, take a look at this question where it made a huge difference, it's a good example of the application
p18529
aVTriggering - for the updated question
p18530
aVThere are 2 main event-handler triggering functions available, they fall under the same "Event Handler Attachment" category in the API, these are  and
p18531
aVhas some shortcuts built-in for the common events, for example:
p18532
aVYou can view a listing including these shortcuts here
p18533
aVAs for the difference,  triggers the event handler (but not the default action most of the time, e
p18534
ag224
aVplacing the cursor at the right spot in a clicked )
p18535
aVIt causes the event handlers to occur in the order they were bound (as the native event would), fires the native event actions, and bubbles up the DOM
p18536
aVis usually for a different purpose, here you're just trying to fire the bound handler(s), it doesn't cause the native event to fire, e
p18537
ag224
aVsubmitting a form
p18538
aVIt doesn't bubble up the DOM, and it's not chainable (it returns whatever the last-bound event handler for that event returns)
p18539
aVFor example if you wanted to trigger a  event but not actually focus the object, you just want code you bound with  to run, this would do that, whereas  would do that as well as actually focus the element and bubble up
p18540
aVHere is a real world example:
p18541
aVThis would run any submit handlers, for example the jQuery validation plugin, then try to submit the
p18542
aVHowever if you just wanted to validate, since it's hooked up via a  event handler, but not submit the  afterwards, you could use , like this:
p18543
aVThe plugin prevents the handler from submitting the form by bombing out if the validation check doesn't pass, but with this method we don't care what it does
p18544
aVWhether it aborted or not we're not trying to submit the form, we just wanted to trigger it to re-validate and do nothing else
p18545

p18561
aVYou can view a demo here, comment it out and click run again to see the difference
p18562
aVThe short version is that when most event types happen, they happen on the immediate element, then bubble up the DOM, occurring on each parent as they go

aVWhen  finishes animating to  it then queues the  animation
