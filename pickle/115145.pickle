VDoes the Gmail/Email applications allow you to extend them in this way
p4
aVGmail is closed source, and so it is difficult to know what it does or does not support
p5
aVThe Email application is not part of the public SDK, so trying to rely upon any ContentProvider it may have (and I don't know that it has one) would be a mistake, as your application is liable to break with subsequent Android updates
p6
aVI would at least like to add a menu item to the email viewer screen that would allow the user to flag the email content as needing to be scanned
p7
aVThe only way to do that assumes Gmail/Email uses Menu#addIntentOptions(), and via Google Code Search, this does not appear to be the case

p1702
aVAs self-appointed President of the Anti-Activity-Tab Alliance (AATA), that's certainly my position
p1703
aVWhen an icon corresponding to a
p1704
aVPerson, Place, or Event is clicked, it
p1705
aVfires off a VIEW Intent on a URI
p1706
aVcorresponding to that object; this is
p1707
aVpicked up by an Activity that then
p1708
aVshows the object
p1709
aVNote that this has nothing to do with having activities as the contents of tabs
p1710
aVWe can launch a new activity to show
p1711
aVthe map again, but now we have the map
p1712
aVactivity as the content of the tab,
p1713
aVplus the show activity, plus the new
p1714

p1715
aVgiven how resource intensive the map
p1716
aVactivity is, I'm guessing this is not

p1720

p1722

aVwell as strongly coupling our program
p1727
aVin a way we don't want
p1728
aVThis doesn't follow at all from what you wrote previously
p1729
aVYour "back events" will not change one iota between using Views as the contents of tabs and using Activities as the contents of tabs
p1730
aVFurthermore, this has nothing whatsoever to do with the "loose coupling" pattern you describe -- clicking on an icon in a list in a view in a tab is no different than clicking on an icon in a list in a view in an activity in a tab
p1731
aVJust have your Show activity tell your, um, main activity to show a particular location, then the Show activity can
p1732
aVThe simplest way to do that without introducing a hard JVM coupling between the activities is to broadcast an  and register a  in the main activity
p1733
aVUpon receipt of this , the main activity would update the map and set it to be the current tab
p1734
aVOf course, this approach is simpler if you have the main activity use Views for its tab contents
p1735

aVIt is conceivable you could create an Objective-C implementation in C/C++ that could run on Android via the Android NDK, but NDK libraries have limited system access, meaning you would not be able to do much in Objective-C
p3350
aVIt is conceivable that your Objective-C implementation could run as a standalone application on rooted hardware, and therefore have access to more of the system, but then you pretty much aren't running Android anymore
p3351
aVIt is inconceivable to create an Objective-C implementation that will run on the Dalvik VM and have performance similar to a native implementation of Objective-C on the iPhone

aVSince both  and  are asynchronous, something might be going haywire with the timing, in which case you may get better luck if you call  from your 's  method
p4959
aVAlso, bear in mind that the exact timing of the service being destroyed is up to Android and may not be immediate

aVThis means that while it is technically possible to swap cards, it is inconvenient enough that users won't want to do it much
p5023
aVHence, you should think of this not as temporarily removing access to their music and such, but semi-permanently removing access
p5024
aVThis is unlikely to be popular in consumer devices

p5178
aVTake a look at the  content provider, for example
p5179
aVContacts can have many email addresses, many phone numbers, etc
p5180
aVThe way that is accomplished is by doing inserts/updates/deletes on the "many" side
p5181
aVTo add a new phone number, you insert a new phone number, providing an ID of the contact for whom the phone number pertains
p5182
aVYou would do the same if you had a plain SQLite database with no content provider
p5183
aVOne-to-many relationships in relational databases are achieved via inserts/updates/deletes on a table for the "many" side, each having a foreign key back to the "one" side
p5184
aVNow, from an OO standpoint, this isn't ideal

p5849
aVMore likely, it is precisely what you need
p5850
aVIf you start a thread in an , then fail to stop that thread, it will run forever, until Android terminates the process, since you have no way of stopping it
p5851
aVThe only sort-of acceptable exception is if your thread stops itself, and then you have to be very very careful that it actually does terminate cleanly
p5852
aVOn the other hand, you can arrange to stop a running  whenever you need, from any , and that  can arrange to stop the thread, so you don't leak the thread indefinitely
p5853
aVI strongly encourage you to implement a service that manages the thread

p5989
aVThe right answer is drag-and-drop
p5990
aVThere's some code for that floating around the Android source for the Music app, but it's outside my skill level with touch events right now
p5991
aVIn the one case I wanted this feature, I created a list using up/down buttons to let the user resequence

p5993
aVUsing a context menu, as you indicate, can certainly be made to work, but if you can spare the on-screen real estate, putting the buttons on will be easier
p5994
aVYou might even consider toggling the button visibility on/off via an option menu, if having them on-screen the whole time will be unpleasant

p6127
aVWhy does the android framework make
p6128
aVextending widget so difficult
p6129
aVWhile it is conceivable that a reimplemented  might make it simpler for you to make it orient differently, the core Android team has to weigh such reimplementation against other development priorities
p6130
aVOne of those priorities is SDK fidelity
p6131
aVThey want to make sure that, to the greatest extent possible, code written for Android 1
p6132
aV5 can run on Android 2
p6133
aV1 without modification
p6134
aVThis limits them in two ways
p6135
aVFirst, they cannot just change the existing , for example, to accommodate your desires, if doing so causes them to break their existing API
p6136
aVSecond, the core Android team will not expose new methods or classes, even if those might be beneficial to third-party developers, unless and until the team is ready to support those methods or classes for the long haul
p6137
aVAndroid was initially written before an SDK existed
p6138
aVThat's the reason given for why most of the built-in applications (e
p6139
ag198
aV, calculator) cannot be built with the SDK alone, but needs to be built as part of a firmware image
p6140
aVSimilarly, the core Android team had to make a decision, as part of creating the initial SDK, of how best to take the existing code and create public stuff we can work with and protected/private stuff we cannot, with SDK fidelity in mind
p6141
aVAs you may have noticed, Android is vast, and so creating the SDK must have taken a correspondingly vast amount of staff time
p6142
aVRewriting lots of it to increase the odds that somebody could, say, create a vertical  wasn't probably high on their list
p6143

aVThere are too many variables for simple "it's 50% slower" answers

aVThe DROID has floating-point hardware (FPU), and the G1 does not, for example
p6366
aVIf you're doing lots of floating-point calculations, the disparity between the DROID and the G1 will be greater than the relative CPU speeds would indicate
p6367
aVSimilarly, access speeds for on-board flash, graphics hardware acceleration, and the like may all differ in ways that aren't tied to CPU speed
p6368
aVAnd, different apps will use those capabilities differently -- your app might run all from RAM while others are constantly loading from on-board flash (or, worse, from the SD card, which speeds vary even more widely)
p6369
aVThe emulator bears little resemblance to real hardware from a performance standpoint
p6370
aVFor example, there is no graphics hardware acceleration at all
p6371
aVUsing the emulator to test whether your game works is one thing; using it to benchmark performance seems pointless to me
p6372
aVHeck, I can't get the emulator to play back video reliably on a quad-core PC

aVPerhaps someday it will exist, courtesy of a crowdsourced database or something

VTo quote myself:
p6828
aVIf your application is compiled for
p6829
aVAndroid 1
p6830
aV5 or lower, Android will
p6831
aVassume your application was designed
p6832
aVto look good on the classic screen
p6833
aVsize and resolution
p6834
aVAndroid will then
p6835
aVautomatically do the following:
p6836
aVIf your application is installed on a device with a larger screen,
p6837
aVAndroid will run your application in
p6838
aV"compatibility mode", scaling
p6839
aVeverything based on the actual screen
p6840
aVsize
p6841
aVSo, suppose you have a 24px
p6842
aVsquare PNG file, and Android install
p6843
aVand runs your application on a device
p6844
aVwith the standard physical size but a
p6845
aVWVGA resolution (a so-called
p6846
aV"high-density" screen)
p6847
aVAndroid might
p6848
aVscale your PNG file to be 36px when it
p6849
aVdisplays it, so it will take up the
p6850
aVsame visible space on the screen
p6851
aVOn
p6852
aVthe plus side, Android handles this
p6853
aVautomatically; on the minus side,
p6854
aVbitmap scaling algorithms tend to make
p6855
aVthe images a bit fuzzy
p6856
aVAndroid will block your application from running on a device
p6857
aVwith a smaller screen
p6858
aVHence, QVGA
p6859
aVdevices, like the HTC Tattoo, will be
p6860
aVunable to get your application, even
p6861
aVif it is available on the Android
p6862
aVMarket
p6863
aVIf your application is compiled for Android 1

aVMost Android devices have touchscreens

aVFor example, there are firms developing Android set-top boxes (think Android equivalents of Roku or Boxee Box)
p7810
aVMost televisions are not touchscreens
p7811
aVNow, if you want your application to only be usable with a touchscreen -- and you have set the appropriate  elements in your manifest --  may be reliable for detecting a progress change
p7812
aVPersonally, I would update the database on neither  nor , but at the point when the user does something positive to indicate they want to persist the current screen's contents -- pressing the BACK button, clicking a Save button, etc

p8645
aVSo, I'll describe this in the fashion of how I'd approach the problem
p8646
aVOne solution is the one described in twk's answer
p8647
aVYou don't have to use the SD card, but you probably do have to have a world-readable temporary file in your app-local file store ()
p8648
aVDownload the first chunk, decrypt it, write it out as a complete world-readable MP3 file (but with a suitably obscure directory/path), and hand it to a  via
p8649
aVWhile that plays, you download/decrypt and set up a second  instance, which starts playback as soon as the first one ends, for as seamless a transition as possible
p8650
aVYou then reset the first  and reuse it with your third chunk, ping-ponging between the two
p8651
aVA related solution would be in jleedev's comment
p8652
aVIt's pretty much the same thing, except that you provide a  via a
p8653
aVThis has an option to let you use a socket, which may let you avoid the temporary file
p8654
aVHowever, the  will have to itself be publicly accessible, and so the temporary file, with an obscure directory, might actually be more private
p8655
aVIf you are worried about the fact that these things can be read by other processes, please understand that  itself (or, rather, the OpenCORE subsystem) is in another process
p8656
aVAlso, your proposed HTTP server is world-readable on the device as well
p8657
aVSo, security by obscurity is your only viable option if you are going to let  do the decoding
p8658
aVAFAIK, the NDK does not grant access to OpenCORE, though I confess as to having limited NDK experience, so I may be wrong
p8659
aVThere are certainly other MP3 decoders available (/, etc
p8660
aV, though how readily these could be converted into an NDK library is unclear
p8661

aVOr, at least, don't use them yourself -- those are for other applications to use
p12545
aVThey add overhead that you do not need for stuff inside your own VM
p12546
aVwhich leads me to theorize that memory is leaking on the stack
p12547
aVIs this even possible
p12548
aVNot really
p12549
aVThe main application thread stack is trivially small
p12550
aVOther threads have stacks that could get a lot bigger, but I'll be surprised if you are chewing up 42MB that way
p12551
aVIf it is, what can I do to stop or
p12552
aVinvestigate the leak
p12553
aVSince you already did a "spike solution" of testing sans UI and determining that is OK, I'd slowly reintroduce the UI and see when you start getting the problem
p12554
aVOne likely candidate problem area would be updating the activity from a background thread, so you might turn that off and see what happens
p12555
aVSince your problem isn't in the heap itself, my guess is that your problem is tied to bitmaps or other things that have lots of off-heap RAM usage

aVUsing  as the contents of tabs makes all of your concerns worse
p13420
aVUsing  as the contents of tabs takes up more memory, because more  get created beyond those you declare in an activity
p13421
aVUsing  as the contents of tabs takes up a few layers more of stack space, one of the most precious commodities in Android
p13422
aVUsing  as the contents of tabs takes up CPU time, as Android has to unravel your activity to get at the  inside of it, anyway

VGenerally speaking, the emulator is much slower than a device at CPU and GPU tasks
p13463
aVThat's for at least two reasons:
p13464
aVThe emulator is running ARM opcodes, converting them into equivalent x86 instructions, which is slow
p13465
aVDevices (usually) have graphics accelerators, whereas the emulated environment does not, despite whatever video card you have on the machine running the emulator
p13466
aVTo put things in perspective, I do my Android work on an Intel quad-core 2
p13467
aV66GHz with a fairly nice graphics card
p13468
aVFor videos that work fine on devices, I can sometimes get them to play back in the emulator
p13469
aVThe emulator is faster than a device, though, at "disk" I/O
p13470
aVWhen you write to "flash" on the emulator, you are writing to a disk image file that probably resides on a regular hard drive, assuming you're not using an SSD
p13471
aVActually writing to flash on a device can be massively slower -- Brad Fitzpatrick, at last week's Google I|O 2010 conference, cited spikes of up to 200ms to write a single byte to flash
p13472
aVAnd, the combination of Android, flash, and the yaffs2 filesystem apparently causes a device to get progressively slower at flash I/O as the flash fills up
p13473
aVHence, his recommendation was to do any flash writes in a background thread instead of the main application thread, where it can tie up the UI and lead to a "janky" app
p13474
aV(apparently, "janky" is a technical term
p13475

p13476
aVBTW, when it shows up online, definitely watch Brad's presentation on YouTube

p14663
aVAs others have noted, there is no such thing as "car acceleration"
p14664
aVThere is only acceleration
p14665
aVAcceleration, as a concept in physics, can come from everything from a car to the device being shaken
p14666
aVSo, for example, here is some code that detects a device being shaken
p14667
aVSo, the question then becomes: can you come up with an acceleration value that is definitively from a car in motion
p14668
aVI suspect the answer is no, for most cars
p14669
aVFor example, this site indicates that a 2008 Aston Martin demonstrates an acceleration of 6
p14670
aV5 meters/second^2
p14671
aVThe force of gravity is greater (9
p14672
aV8 meters/second^2)
p14673
aVMy shake code will only register a shake at around 12 meters/second^2 -- less than that, and simple movements will be considered a shake
p14674
aVAs another answer suggests, you are probably better served using GPS
p14675

aVI am under the impression that most of the cases are that they simply have not gotten around to it yet
p14775
aVBy "gotten around to it yet", I mean they haven't finalized the classes and method signatures they want to stick with for all time
p14776
aVThe core Android team tries to minimize the amount of API breakage between releases, and generally succeeds (breakage tends to be more changed behaviors than changes in method signatures)
p14777
aVGetting buy-in from all stakeholders for a given hunk of code takes a fair bit of effort
p14778
aVThere is a ton of code in Android, some of which probably could go in the SDK, but only so much time gets allocated to that chore, compared to advancing Android capabilities
p14779
aVIn some cases, the answer is security -- that beyond not having a stable API, they do not know how they want to secure it yet, so they make it be available solely to firmware developers
p14780
aVIn a few cases, the answer may be performance -- they have their required use cases tuned appropriately, but there are others that outside developers might try that have not been optimized

aVFrom a coding standpoint, if the database is small, keeping it on-device and updating it periodically would be OK

aVHow do I determine the MIME type of my different tables of data

p20740
aVBear in mind that  is not only used for a table-style structure -- it can be used for returning files as well
p20741
aVIn this case, you'd try to use the MIME types appropriate to the file in question
p20742
aVCould someone give me a good explanation of this
p20743
aVYou are presumably viewing this Web page in a Web browser
p20744
aVWhen you clicked the link or whatever that led you here, your Web browser made an HTTP request to the Web server, providing a URI of
p20745
aVThe StackOverflow Web server returned the content of the page, along with the MIME type of the content itself
p20746
aVThis latter piece is important, particularly for this URI, since there is no file extension
p20747
aVWithout a MIME type, the Web browser would not know what to do with the results of the HTTP request
p20748
aVAndroid follows the same model
p20749
aVFor example, you can create an   for a  representing a contact in the
p20750
aVHowever, if there were no way for Android to figure out a MIME type, you could not start an activity using the Intent
p20751
aVAndroid needs to ask the , "yo, dawg, U gots me a MIME type fo' this Uri
p20752

aVcreateChooser(Intent target, CharSequence title) and somehow get the list or do I have to get all activities, retrieve their Intents and use hasCategory(String category) on every Intent
p25326
aVUse  for an /
p25327
aVThen, you will run into the problem of that these activities are merely the entry points for the home screen and may or may not be the ones that actually display the home screen itself
p25328
aVThen, you will run into the problem of determining if this is the activity that is on the screen
p25329
aVI don't know if that is possible
p25330
aV, for example, will tell you if it is running (answer: 100% of the time), but I do not see where it has the notion of one being on the screen and others not
p25331
aVThen, you will run into the problem of where even the  APIs that exist are not event-driven, meaning you will still need to be running your code to poll the , though you may be able to save a few instructions by skipping work if you somehow determine the home screen is not in the foreground
p25332
aVHence, I go back to "please allow this to be configurable by the user", since you are just begging for one-star ratings on the Market, particularly depending on what you intend to do every 5 seconds

Vhow do I go about having my app display correctly on both the resolutions without either "squashing" my images or cutting bits off of giving me black bars etc
p26247
aVIMHO, you start by revisiting your GUI design:
p26248
aVMy app is heavily dependent on images that are fitted correctly to the screen they are being displayed on
p26249
aVThat does not work particularly well anywhere, IMHO
p26250
aVWindows (including browsers) can be sized to any desired size by the user, for example
p26251
aVThere doesn't seem an immediately present solution where I can just have it display a different image automatically from the drawable folder for the right screen
p26252
aVBecause Android devices can have any number of screen dimensions, just like windows and Web browsers can have any number of screen dimensions
p26253
aVAndroid does let you choose images based on density (e
p26254

aVYou do not understand all of this, and therefore are thinking your timer is going when, in reality, the device has fallen asleep and the CPU has turned off
p27465
aVWhen the CPU turns back on again, your timer will go off immediately

aVUsing  allows you to do timer-based events that wake up the device, and do not require your code to be hanging around in memory in the meantime

VHow is actually sharing application component being done
p28594
aVThat depends entirely on what you consider an "application component" to be, and what you consider "sharing" to be
p28595
aVThis is what the Android Dev Guide says
p28596
aVThat is a fairly bad piece of the documentation
p28597
aVHere is how I would write it:
p28598
aVA central feature of Android is that one application can make use of components (e
p28599
ag198
aV, activities, services) of other applications (provided those applications permit it)
p28600
aVFor example, if your application needs to display a list of contacts and another application has developed an activity that does just that and made it available to others, you can call upon that activity to do the work, rather than develop your own
p28601
aVYour application doesn't incorporate the code of the other application
p28602
aVRather, it simply starts up that piece of the other application when the need arises
p28603
aVIs the only way of getting such a 'private application' information to contact the developers of that application
p28604
aVEither developers are intending for you to integrate with them, or they are not
p28605
aVIf they are, they should be documenting how to do that (e
p28606
ag198
aV,  formats to be used with  to trigger their code)
p28607
aVIf they do not document such integration points, you can certainly ask the developers to add some
p28608
aVHowever, randomly shooting  at them in hopes of getting a response, even if it temporarily works, is little better than script kiddie tactics -- those developers are not obligated to ensure you code works when they upgrade their app
p28609
aVIs information about the data that the application operates with private, too
p28610
aVI do not know what "information about the data that the application operates with" means
p28611
aVData managed by an application is private by default
p28612
aVAgain, application developers can offer integration points for data (e
p28613
ag198
aV, content provider, remote service API) -- some do, some do not
p28614
aVone of the things that grabbed me was the impression of immense interoperability
p28615
aVAndroid offers greater interoperability potential than some other mobile platforms
p28616
aVHowever, using that potential requires consent among the interoper-ees
p28617
aVYou cannot unilaterally decide to hack into another app's database, or invoke private activities, just because you feel like it
p28618
aVShould more Android developers offer more integration points
p28619
aVIn the abstract, sure
p28620
aVHowever, bear in mind that this adds support costs (e
p28621
ag198
aV, answering integration questions) and limits coding flexibility (e
p28622
ag198
aV, need to maintain a stable API for those doing the integrating)
p28623
aVDevelopers cannot be blamed if they do not wish to incur all that

VI need to display a list of these strings, which obviously is most easily done by nesting a ListView in an other ListView
p29000
aVNo, the easiest thing is to put your single list of strings into a
p29001
aVThat is making a ListView whose rows contain other ListViews
p29002
aVThat is unlikely to work, as scrollable things cannot usually hold other scrollable things
p29003
aVIt will also confuse the heck out of the user
p29004
aVNow, what I suspect you were trying to write is that you have several distinct sets of "arbitrary number of strings" and that you are trying to put them all into one
p29005
aVTo do that, you can:
p29006
aVJust concatenate the arrays of strings together, then use a regular
p29007
aVUse my , if you want distinct adapters per set (e

aV, differently-formatted rows)
p29009
aVUse , as user519515 suggested
p29010
aVThe number of times the getView() for a ListAdapter gets called seems to have little to do with the number of elements the backing array contains
p29011
aVis called based on the number of visible rows and the amount of scrolling a user does
p29012
aVTherefore, it is only loosely connected to the number of items in the adapter

aVYou can watch for the MENU key via  in your activity, at which point you can display whatever you want, including something that supports context menus
p29235

aVFirst, some users have devices with physical keyboards that only operate in landscape mode

aVI am going to assume, for the moment, that you are writing the 1,337th alarm clock application for Android, and therefore popping up an activity from a  based on an  alarm is a reasonable choice (assuming the user requested it via preferences within your app)
p29892
aVGiven that, you cannot "kill" an activity from a service
p29893

aVThis suggests that you did indeed unbind from the service, but the service did not stop the music playback when it was destroyed
p30447
aVWhat am I doing wrong
p30448
aVMost music players are designed to allow playback after the user exits the activity

aVStep #1: Temporarily modify your code (or create a scrap project with the relevant portions of your code), where you can click a button or something to run exactly once through the sensor processing logic
p30547
aVStep #2: Get into DDMS (standalone or the Eclipse perspective)
p30548
aVStep #3: Choose your emulator, then click on the Allocation Tracker tab

p30550
aVStep #4: Click the button, and when the sensor processing pass is complete, click Get Allocations on the DDMS Allocation Tracker tab
p30551
aVThis will tell you what was allocated during that portion of your code

aVThat is impossible to answer given what you have written above

p31013
aVIn traditional desktop applications we can add more than one handlers

aVThe question of whether there is one handler or more than one handler to an event is determined by the GUI toolkit
p31015
aVIt has nothing to do with "desktop applications"
p31016
aVFurthermore, most programming languages in modern use offer some sort of interface or late-binding way to allow you to use the composite pattern to have the net effect of multiple handlers

VI understand that "internal memory is perceived to be the flash that is used to store APKs, ROM images, etc
p31579
aVThe specification for my HTC Hero says that there is "ROM: 512MB, RAM: 288MB" with no indication of how the RAM is subdivided
p31580
aVThe RAM is not "subdivided" on any sort of permanent basis
p31581
aVRAM is used by running processes on an as-needed basis
p31582
aVThe biggest thing for SDK apps to note is that there is an upper bound as to how much RAM a process can consume -- on your Hero, it should be 16MB
p31583
aVOn the phone the "Settings"->"SD & phone storage" page simply refers to "SD card" and "Internal phone storage" and for the latter just shows one amount for "Available space"
p31584
aVThe "Internal phone storage" refers to the portion of on-board flash space set aside for APK files, databases, preferences, and other local files
p31585
aVThe page also mentions SQLite database files which I think can be stored in the "Internal storage"
p31586
aVCorrect
p31587
aVHowever, the page doesn't seem to offer any explanation of the sub-division of RAM between Internal Storage and another (presumably more dynamic) type
p31588
aVRAM has nothing to do with internal storage
p31589
aVIs there some kind of dynamic division of the total RAM (288MB on the Hero) into two sub-divisions which are usable in different ways
p31590
aVNo
p31591
aVLet's step back a pace
p31592
aVRAM is RAM is RAM
p31593
aVRAM on your phone is not significantly different than RAM on your desktop, your notebook, your netbook, etc
p31594
aVThis construct has remained relatively stable in its use for the past few decades, particularly once we escaped from the mainframe
p31595
aVRunning programs (OS and end-user apps) consume RAM, but only while they are running
p31596
aVAnd RAM gets wiped on a reboot, on phones as much as on your desktop
p31597
aVNow, your average desktop, notebook, or netbook also has a hard drive for more permanent storage than RAM offers
p31598
aVThere is no absolute term for the equivalent in Android -- I tend to use "on-board flash storage" for it, others call it "internal storage", though as you will see, the latter term is fraught with confusion
p31599
aVJust like a hard drive, on-board flash storage is used for the OS (a
p31600
ag4854
ag4855
aV, firmware in Android), end-user programs (a
p31601
ag4854
ag4855
aV, APK files in Android), and end-user data (a
p31602
ag4854
ag4855
aV, databases, shared preferences, and other files stored where  is located)
p31603
aVThe on-board flash storage is divided into a few partitions
p31604
aVIf you're a Windows user, partitions is basically saying "your hard drive is broken into C:, E:, and F: drives"
p31605
aVIn Android, one partition is dedicated to firmware, and another partition (the "data partition") is dedicated to the end-user programs and data
p31606
aV(NOTE: the preceding description is not entirely accurate, but the discrepancies are well beyond the scope of this answer)
p31607
aVSo, with all that in mind:
p31608
aVYour 512MB of ROM is the on-board flash storage, hearkening back to the old "flash ROM" term
p31609
aVYour "Internal phone storage" in settings it the available space in the data partition for end-user apps and data (one of the reasons why I don't use this term to refer to the on-board flash storage as a whole)
p31610
aVYour "SD card" is more generically referred to in Android as external storage, which on many devices is some form of SD card, though it could actually be just another partition of the on-board flash storage designated as serving in the role of external storage

aVThe Android upstream project defines a number of core applications, such as a phone dialer, calendar, contacts book, music player, and so on
p31659
aVDevice
p31660
aVimplementers MAY replace these applications with alternative versions
p31661
aVHowever, any such alternative versions MUST honor the same Intent patterns provided by the upstream project
p31662
aVFor example, if a device contains an
p31663
aValternative music player, it must still honor the Intent pattern issued by third-party applications to pick a song
p31664
aVThe catch is, the Messenger app is not considered a "core application" by Google
p31665
aVHence, device manufacturers are welcome to include their own SMS clients, with their own  filters
p31666
aVIn the case of the HTC Incredible, apparently they did not include support for MMS via an
p31667
aVNow, IMHO, Messenger probably should be a core application
p31668
aVHowever, your opinion and mine do not change reality as it stands today
p31669
aVhow do I evaluate this problem (OR UNKNOWN PROBLEMS) with phone types I have no access to
p31670
aVYou redefine your application such that it is not a "problem"
p31671
aVYou have no guarantee that you can send an MMS that way, just as you have no guarantee that a user has a Facebook app installed
p31672
aVI don't know much about MMS and am uncertain if there is a way other than  to send an MMS
p31673
aVYou might consider poking through the source code to the Messenger app to see how it does it
p31674

ag198
aV, scrolling)
p31715
aVThe catch here is that you're doing a bunch of little queries (bad) and doing them on the main application thread while the user is scrolling (really bad)
p31716
aVDo one big query using an  clause to get all tags for all notes, and convert the resulting  into a fully-populated
p31717
aVThen, your per-row lookups will all succeed
p31718
aVThis works well if you only have a modest number of rows; otherwise, this query may take longer than the user has patience for
p31719
aVIf your schema is flexible, you might consider whether you are better served with some amount of denormalization, such as having the tags in a single column of the notes table via a comma-delimited list or something

p31900
aVBuild your own firmware, or build your own media player (like VLC for Android)
p31901
aVAlso, I would like the codec to be installed as part of an application installation (or first launch) and NOT as part of a full Android OS build
p31902
aVThat is not possible, unless you build your own media player
p31903
aVThe reason I want to do this is that I have an application that needs to show a video of a non supported codec (HLS or TS), but I wouldn't want to build a full blown video player - just integrate with the existing, built-in, player

VCan we redirect it to another page, by tracking the exception, without showing that force close
p31911
aVFirst, for all places where runtime exceptions are expected, handle them locally with a / block
p31912
aVThen, for everything else, use  and
p31913
aVThis is great for connecting to ACRA, Flurry, or other services that will let you track crashes that occur in your application on your users' devices

aVBear in mind that if you have an unhandled runtime exception, you have no way of knowing if your application is in a useful state, so be very careful about what you do

p31933
aVIf you are running this on a device, welcome to flash I/O
p31934
aVFlash I/O can be very slow, depending on what else is all going on with the device
p31935
aVMost Android devices use the YAFFS2 filesystem, which uses a global partition lock to single-thread access to the filesystem
p31936
aVAnd flash writes are slower yet, due to wear-level balancing and whatnot
p31937
aVYou should watch Brad Fitzpatrick's "Writing Zippy Android Apps" presentation from the 2010 Google I|O conference
p31938
aVIn there, he indicates that writing a single byte to flash -- while normally very speedy -- can sometimes take 200ms

aVIt's faster to change the content of current activity than to start another activity
p32513
aVFor most modern Android devices, the speed difference will not be significant to most users, IMHO

aVIf we have only one activity-context it's simpler to find and solve problems with memory leaks

VWhy is this happening
p33117
aVWelcome to flash
p33118
aVI'm no expert in file IO but I know the fast IO operation times indicate the data hasn't actually been written to disk yet and the big pauses are probably buffers being flushed
p33119
aVProbably not
p33120
aVMost Android devices use the YAFFS2 file system, which does not buffer data too much, as I understand it
p33121
aVHowever, they do have a per-partition write lock, so your pauses are probably when something else is writing to flash
p33122
aVAs more Android devices (e
p33123
ag198
aV, Nexus S) run the ext4 file system, then flushing/syncing becomes important
p33124
aVAlso, bear in mind that flash write speeds will vary by a variety of other factors, such as how full the file system is, the state of wear-leveling on the particular cells being tried, etc

VWhat can I do to stop this IO operation from blocking my UI thread
p33535
aVThe I/O operation is not blocking the main application thread directly
p33536
aVYour code running on the main application thread is blocking the main application thread
p33537
aVYou need to determine where your code running on the main application thread is getting tied up
p33538
aVTo do this, use a debugger, or  statements, or whatever
p33539
aVFor example, on most Android devices, the filesystem is YAFFS2, which has a per-partition global lock
p33540
aVQuoting Brad Fitzpatrick:
p33541
aVyaffs has a giant lock around the whole filesystem code, so even a tiny stat() can block for seconds if the disk is otherwise being hammered by something else (during boot, heavy sync, etc)
p33542
aVHence, if you are tying up the filesystem for seconds in your background thread, the main application thread will be unable to do file I/O of its own
p33543
aVPerhaps that is what is tripping you up, in which case  in Android 2
p33544
aV3 can help you identify the source of your difficulty
p33545
aVWhat's the point of moving it to another thread then
p33546
aVThe point is to move the flash I/O off the main application thread
p33547

VI am building an app where I would like a service to run indefinitely
p33558
aVWherever it can be avoided, this is not recommended
p33559
aVBy default, it doesn't work, as Android gets more and more aggressive with each passing release about stopping this practice for non-foreground services (see below)
p33560
aVSo how does that manage to always run in the background
p33561
aVSwype is an input method editor
p33562
aVAs such, even if something shuts it down, it will start up again shortly thereafter, to serve  widgets
p33563
aVI imagine that Android might not bother shutting down this service since it is reasonably likely to need it again in short order, but that's just a guess
p33564
aVHow does Pandora work
p33565
aVIt keeps running even when you Task Kill it
p33566
aVTask killers were de-fanged on Android 2
p33567
aV2, so perhaps the problem is that the task killer simply is not working on your device
p33568
aVBeyond that, you would have to ask the authors of Pandora, or Advanced Task Killer, neither of whom necessarily are monitoring StackOverflow
p33569
aVIdeally I would like to build a Pandora-esque app where the users explicity hit the OFF button, but it will survive trigger happy task killers like myself
p33570
aVThis would be a feature users are aware of / would agree to
p33571
aVUse , to trade off Android not shutting you down (which otherwise will happen) with having a  visible so the user remembers "oh, yes, I did agree to let this service run indefinitely, because it is constantly delivering value to me, rather than just being the product of some sloppy coder who couldn't be bothered to use "

p33583
aVYes
p33584
aVCan you put 2 applications into one manifest somehow
p33585
aVFrom a pure XML standpoint, there is room in the manifest for more than one  element
p33586

p33588
aVFor very quick things, yes
p33589

aVIn another post, you proposed your above solution for one activity to communicate to another activity
p33752
aVIn Android, activities aren't just some Java objects you can toss around willy-nilly
p33753
aVThey are managed by the OS and have particular lifecycles
p33754
aVWhile the observer/observable pattern is quite delightful in some places, it is unsuitable where the observer/observable connection will create garbage collection problems

aVoncreate() instead so I can pass a reference to it
p34703
aVNeither
p34704
aVUsing  means that you want the periodic work to continue even after the user exits the activity
p34705
aVHence, it is very likely that there is no "Playback object", since the user probably is not in your activity
p34706
aVYour service can send its own broadcast  to be picked up if the  activity is still around
p34707
aVThis sample project demonstrates using an ordered broadcast for this, so that if the activity is not around, a  is raised instead
p34708
aVIf, on the other hand, you do not want the periodic work to continue if the user gets out of the activity, then do not use
p34709
aVUse  within the activity, using a  that triggers your service via , then reschedules itself via
p34710
aVIn this case, you can consider using something like a  as a way to have the service let the activity know what is going on, if the activity is still around

VYou really should consider starting with something simpler, as an apparent newcomer to Android
p35582

p35583
aVFirst, you need to decide where the "HTML page" is: on the phone, or on the Internet

p35585
aVYou will need the URL for it (e

p35588
aVThis is not an HTML file -- it is an Android layout file
p35589
aVAssuming you are going to run on Android 1
p35590
aV6 and newer devices, you can add an attribute to the  element, named , that will name a method in your soon-to-be-written  class
p35591
aVIf you are just working with a new project, you might as well just modify the  file that is supplied to you to have this
p35592
aVThen, you need to create an  class
p35593
aVYour project hopefully already has an  class set up for you; if not, you will need to create one yourself
p35594
aVIn , use  (or whatever) to load up the layout file
p35595
aVAdd a method, of the name you specified in , to your , returning  and taking a  as a parameter
p35596
aVIn there, add in a line like:
p35597
aVwhere  is replaced with the URL to your HTML file
p35598
aVNow, it is possible to have the HTML baked into your application, but then you will have a fair bit of difficulty getting the browser application to view it, since that application has no right to your application's files

p35930
aVA full answer to that requires a few pages in (::ahem::) a book

p35932
aVBinding to a service presents challenges when it comes to deal with configuration changes, such as screen rotations
p35933
aVHence, all else being equal, using the command pattern () beats using the binding pattern ()
p35934
aVYou have to use the command pattern if you want your service to run without any activity around to be bound to it
p35935
aVSo, a music player, a large-file downloader, or a cron job set up with  would all tend to use the command pattern
p35936

aVJust be sure you do not irritate your users by doing this

p36717
aVI think there is a simpler solution, a variation on the one employed by Barcode Scanner
p36718
aVStep #1: Create a nice RESTful URL that contains the information you want
p36719
aVBy RESTful I mean no , no , none of that crap
p36720
aVIt'll be a smidge simpler if this is on a distinct domain name, but this could just be something on your existing domain
p36721
aVFor the purposes of this answer, I will assume that this URL looks like
p36722
aVStep #2: For all URLs that could be created following the pattern of Step #1 (anything in ), your Web server should serve up a page saying "Hey
p36723
aVYou don't have ExampleApp installed
p36724
aVIf you click this link here, it will take you to the Android Market, where you can install ExampleApp
p36725
aVThen, try clicking the link that brought you to this page, and it will start up ExampleApp and give you
p36726
aVummm
p36727
aVall this good data"
p36728
aVStep #3: Implement an activity in ExampleApp that has an  with the  action, the  category, and a  element identifying your scheme and domain (and, if needed, the base path, if that will be the same for all of these links)
p36729
aVWhat the user sees, if they do not have ExampleApp installed and click the link, is your Web page from step #2, from which they can go install ExampleApp
p36730
aVWhat the user sees, if they do have ExampleApp installed and click the link, is your activity, which can grab the URL via  and do something useful

aVFor starters, it is probably a copyright violation, unless you have express permission from those developers to bundle this way

aVClassic pop-up context menus are going to be obsolete with the new Honeycomb UI, at least for the tablet form factor, so I would not invest a ton of time in hacking them into widgets where they aren't normally used
p37815
aVMoreover, users are unlikely to discover your context menu, simply because they tend not to discover context menus too often in the first place

aVUsers tend not to experiment by randomly stabbing the screen for a second-plus to see if menus happen to pop up
p37817
aVThe only way they will know about your context menu is if they read the fine manual, and we all know how often that happens
p37818
aVHence, you need some other way for the user to do the same operations -- having them be able to edit/delete only through a non-discoverable context menu is very user-hostile

aVThere is no problem with  per se, but that you are simply running out of memory, and the stack traces you have encountered are simply demonstrating that  is stressing your heap

p38409
aVAny ideas on how I can work around this
p38410
aVFirst, I'd use existing tools (e
p38411
ag198
aV, dumping HPROF and examining with Eclipse MAT) to confirm that you don't have a memory leak in general that the Thunderbolt/LTE combo just seems to be tripping over
p38412

p38413
aVThat could be your existing app with a series of steps to follow, or it could be a dedicated app (e
p38414
ag198
aV, log the URL that triggers the OOM, then create a tiny app that just does that HttpClient request)

aVI wish DeviceAnywhere had  a Thunderbolt, but it doesn't look like it
p38416
aVI'll put some feelers out and see if I can get some help on that front

aVIn terms of working around it, as a stopgap, you can detect that you're running on a Thunderbolt via  data, and perhaps that you're on LTE via  (I'm guessing LTE would list as WiMAX, but that's just a guess), and warn users about the problems with that combo
p38418
aVBeyond that, you can try changing up your HttpClient usage a bit and see if it has an effect, such as:
p38419

p38426
aVis returning that 2MB or so value that is triggering the OOM

p38911
aVPlease use a sensible, user-friendly login system
p38912
aVFor example, if you feel that their login credentials are stale based upon time, then force them to log in again
p38913
aVYou can do this by checking the credentials in , and if they are stale, call  to launch your login activity (or pop up your login dialog, or whatever is your means of logging them in)
p38914
aVOf course, an even better approach is to skip the login entirely
p38915

aVMost mobile applications do not require authentication

p38928
aVThis is not a good idea
p38929
aVFirst, you waste megabytes of RAM by keeping your process around
p38930
aVSecond, it will not work, as Android will not let the service "run all the time" -- it will shut down your service for old age eventually
p38931

p38938
aVis it better also to delete the broadcast receiver variables (i

p38940
aVdeleting means more free memory for the system, but causes garbage collection and extra memory operations (when the screen turns on i have to create a new receiver) which are expensive

p40781

p40783
aVvanish
p40784
aVFor example, the default music
p40785
aVplayer application that ships with

aVmusic playback
p40788
aVThat way, the user can
p40789
aVlisten to music while continuing to
p40790
aVuse their phone for other purposes
p40791
aVThe service only stops when the user
p40792
aVgoes in and presses the stop button in
p40793
aVthe music player activity
p40794
aVIf that
p40795
aVservice were to be shut down
p40796
aVunexpectedly, the user might wonder
p40797
aVwhat is wrong
p40798
aVServices like this can declare
p40799
aVthemselves as being part of the
p40800
aV"foreground"
p40801
aVThis will cause their
p40802
aVpriority to rise and make them less
p40803
aVlikely to be bumped out of memory
p40804
aVThe
p40805
aVtrade-off is that the service has to
p40806
aVmaintain a , so the user
p40807
aVknows that this service is claiming
p40808
aVpart of the foreground
p40809
aVAnd, ideally,
p40810
aVthat  provides an easy
p40811
aVpath back to some activity where the
p40812
aVuser can stop the service
p40813

p41236
aVUPDATE
p41237
aVTwo recent things of note:
p41238
aVFirst, on Android 4
p41239
aV4+, you do not have write access to removable media (e
p41240
ag198
aV, "external SD"), except for any locations on that media that might be returned by  and
p41241
aVSee Dave Smith's excellent analysis of this, particularly if you want the low-level details
p41242
aVSecond, lest anyone quibble on whether or not removable media access is otherwise part of the Android SDK, here is Dianne Hackborn's assessment:
p41243
aVkeep in mind: until Android 4
p41244
aV4, the official Android platform has not supported SD cards at all except for two special cases: the old school storage layout where external storage is an SD card (which is still supported by the platform today), and a small feature added to Android 3
p41245
aV0 where it would scan additional SD cards and add them to the media provider and give apps read-only access to their files (which is also still supported in the platform today)
p41246
aVAndroid 4
p41247
aV4 is the first release of the platform that has actually allowed applications to use SD cards for storage
p41248
aVAny access to them prior to that was through private, unsupported APIs
p41249
aVWe now have a quite rich API in the platform that allows applications to make use of SD cards in a supported way, in better ways than they have been able to before: they can make free use of their app-specific storage area without requiring any permissions in the app, and can access any other files on the SD card as long as they go through the file picker, again without needing any special permissions

aVEverything offered by fragments can, by definition, be done using , simply because fragments are built on top of the view framework
p41264
aVHowever, fragments make more complicated scenarios involving dynamic fragments a bit easier IMHO
p41265

aVThat is impossible to answer in the abstract

aVThat portion of the documentation was written in 2008, perhaps earlier
p41417
aVHad fragments existed back then, I imagine the documentation would state that a fragment is a "single, focused thing that the user can do", with activities serving as an orchestration layer, determining what fragments are visible in what circumstances
p41418
aVThe documentation will not in all places be updated to reflect fragments, and even if it does, it will take some time

VIt seems a bit crazy from a memory management point of view that each time you want to display a different form / page you need to use StartActivity which then creates a new instances of the class instead of reusing instances previously created
p41767
aVTactically, you are welcome to add  to bring an existing activity back to the foreground, so long as you understand the ramifications from a navigation standpoint
p41768
aVHowever, your question is rather curious
p41769
aVHow are you accessing StackOverflow
p41770
aVClearly it's not via a Web browser
p41771
aVWeb browsers use the exact mechanism that you feel is "crazy", rendering Web pages even if that Web page had been viewed previously
p41772
aVThey have been doing so for over 15 years, and we've been doing OK by it
p41773
aVThe Android navigation model is designed to approximately mirror that of the Web:
p41774
aVUsers click on things to move forward
p41775
aVUsers click on a BACK button to move to the previous thing they were looking at
p41776
aVUsers click on a HOME button when they want to switch to some other major thing to go look at
p41777
aVBy "reusing instances previously created", you're circumventing that navigational model
p41778
aVFor example, let's suppose your activity stack were A-B-C-D, and you call  with an  for B and
p41779
aVNow, the activity stack is A-C-D-B
p41780
aVWhen the user presses BACK times, they no longer are on the B they were looking at originally, but are back at A
p41781
aVIn a browser, this would be rather strange behavior
p41782
aVThere are other flags on , or attributes on  in the manifest, that offer "reusing instances previously created"
p41783
aVHowever, they are not there "from a memory management point of view"
p41784
aVThey are there where the traditional Web BACK-heavy navigation pattern does not fit your needs
p41785

VTo quote myself from one of my books:
p42180
aVAndroid's  class has the built-in ability to "ellipsize" text,
p42181
aVtruncating it and adding an ellipsis if the text is longer than the available
p42182
aVspace
p42183
aVYou can use this via the  attribute, for example
p42184
aVThis works fairly well, at least for single-line text
p42185
aVThe ellipsis that Android uses is not three periods
p42186
aVRather it uses an actual
p42187
aVellipsis character, where the three dots are contained in a single glyph
p42188
aVHence, any font that you use that you also use the "ellipsizing" feature will
p42189
aVneed the ellipsis glyph
p42190
aVBeyond that, though, Android pads out the string that gets rendered on-
p42191
aVscreen, such that the length (in characters) is the same before and after
p42192
aV"ellipsizing"
p42193
aVTo make this work, Android replaces one character with the
p42194
aVellipsis, and replaces all other removed characters with the Unicode
p42195
aVcharacter 'ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE' ()
p42196
aVThis means the
p42197
aV"extra" characters after the ellipsis do not take up any visible space on
p42198
aVscreen, yet they can be part of the string
p42199
aVHowever, this means any custom fonts you use for  widgets that
p42200
aVyou use with  must also support this special Unicode
p42201

aVIf you were to do either of those things in a Web app, your users would consider your Web app to be an epic fail
p42463

p42466
aVSimilarly, when I build a secured Android app, I'll be implementing an inactivity-based mechanism, perhaps something like this:

p42469

aVStep #4: Your authentication activity, upon success, sets up the singleton  object with the current timestamp
p42475
aVStep #5: Your  class'  method is where you make the determination if the session is too old
p42476
aVNo matter how the user gets into your application, if the session is too old (or it's a brand-new process), they are forced to authenticate
p42477

aVThis does not mean that you cannot have a rich object model
p43175
aVHowever, just as Web pages are going back to a central server to manipulate the Web app's rich object model, activities will need to reach back to a central store to manipulate your rich object model
p43176
aVAnd, just as Web pages tend to pass around identifiers of objects, your activities can pass around identifiers of objects, so each activity can then access the proper object from the central store
p43177
aVWhether that central store is mediated by a  or via some singleton is up to you and would depend some on what that rich object model was really supposed to represent

p43390
aVWhat I'm wondering is whether I'm on the right track with regards passing messages back and forwards via the parent activity or is there a more direct way of F1 responding to F2 performing something that requires it to be closed and F1 do what it needs to do

p43392
aVWhen the user does something in F1 that should result in a major context shift (e

aV, display some other fragment/activity), F1 should let the hosting activity know, perhaps via a listener interface registered with F1 (to support multiple possible hosting activities)
p43394

p43395
aVSimilarly, when F2 wraps up, it would let its hosting activity know via a listener interface, and that activity can route control back to the appropriate spot

VThe issue I have is that when the service is started in either application, the other application is not notified of any events
p45047
aVThat's because you have two services
p45048
aVJust because the service is packaged in an Android library project does not somehow magically cause two distinct applications to use the same copy
p45049
aVSuch as using the Singleton pattern to retain a single instance, but the problem still seems to exist
p45050
aVBoth applications are running in separate processes, with their own private copy of the service
p45051
aVMy only comprehension of this is that each time either application is started, a new instance of the library is created
p45052
aVLibraries don't have instances
p45053
aVAndroid library projects are not DLLs -- they are more akin to static libraries
p45054
aVThus the library referenced in TestApplicationOne is not the same instance as the library referenced in TestApplicationTwo, and as a result, not being notified
p45055
aVMore accurately, the service in  is a separate copy of the service from the copy in
p45056
aVOr can think of any possible solution
p45057
aVDon't have two separate applications
p45058
aVOr, redesign your apps such that only one has the service, and the other uses the service from the first app
p45059
aVOr, have the service disabled in the manifest in both apps, exported with a stable  (e
p45060
ag198
aV, with a custom action string)
p45061
aVThe first app to be installed/run uses  to see if the service exists (e
p45062
ag198
aV, it's not really the first app) -- seeing that the service does not exist, it enables its own copy of that service
p45063
aVThen, the second app goes through the same process, sees that the service is already there, and uses the remote copy rather than enabling its own
p45064
aVNeither the second or the third are very easy, simply because the data only exists in one app (the one with the service)
p45065
aVHence, if that app is uninstalled, the other app is screwed, even if it happens to have the service code available as a disabled component
p45066
aVIf the apps are clearly described to the user as having a primary/secondary relationship (e
p45067
ag198
aV, app and its plugin), then this may work out -- users hopefully won't expect a plugin to work if the app isn't there, for example

VI found the method in the background thread that writes BluetoothData to the Logcat
p45301
aVSo I am leveraging this method to call a static method, plotData(BluetoothData), in the Plotting Activity
p45302
aVIt works nicely plotting the incoming BluetoothData in real-time
p45303
aVThis story does not add up, or  is misnamed
p45304
aVIn Android, to plot to the screen, you need an  instance, with whatever widget(s) you are plotting on
p45305
aVA  method that does the plotting can be , but somehow it needs the  instance
p45306
aVSo, one of the following must be true:
p45307
aVcontains an  instance (and hence is misnamed), or
p45308
aVtakes more than the one parameter you have indicated, or
p45309
aVyou are holding onto an  instance in a static data member (BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD), or
p45310
aVis not a static method, so you are actually calling it on an  instance
p45311
aVBut, since you repeatedly decline to provide the source code, despite having asked several questions about the code, it is impossible for us to say which of these is really your problem
p45312
aVIs it not thread safe
p45313
aVDo I have a deadlock issue
p45314
aVIs my solution a fragile one
p45315
aVAm I circumventing the Android OS
p45316
aVAm I lucky that it's working at all
p45317
aVOr is there a proper way to extend the existing design
p45318
aVThe first five of these have different answers depending upon which of the four bullets above reflects reality, and I really do not feel like writing out a 20-cell grid of answers
p45319
aVYour last question assumes that you have actually explained your "design", which you have not
p45320
aVUPDATE
p45321
aVSome comments based upon the substantial revision to the question:
p45322
aVI would appreciate an explanation as to why plotData() seemingly must be static in order to work
p45323
aVIt probably doesn't have to be static
p45324
aVIs my current solution an OK one
p45325
aVProbably not
p45326
aVStatic methods are rarely a problem on their own
p45327
aVStatic data is frequently a problem, due to lack of thread safety, memory leaks, and the like
p45328
aVHence, your objective is to minimize or eliminate all static data members
p45329
aVThere are at least four static data members at play here, perhaps more
p45330
aVOne is
p45331
aVThis isn't too bad, in that you reset the static data member to a fresh  on each  call, so your memory leak is modest
p45332
aVHowever, if  somehow were to be called on multiple threads simultaneously -- and, since I don't know your threading model, that's at least possible -- you will have problems, since you have no synchronization
p45333
aVHowever, the far bigger problem is represented by the , , and  static data members are
p45334
aVI have no idea what these objects are
p45335
aVHowever, by their name and your overall objective, it would appear that  actually draws to the screen, which means that  is or holds some subclass of  that is the thing being plotted upon
p45336
aVThis means you violated a cardinal rule of Android development:
p45337
aVNever put something that references a transient  in a static data member
p45338
aVHere, an  represents a transient , "transient" because activities do go away,  because it inherits from
p45339
aVYour statically-referenced  holds a reference back to its
p45340
aVHence, this  can never be garbage collected, which is bad for business, let alone any possible thread-safety issues
p45341
aVAgain, this is an educated guess, since I don't know what those static data members really are

p45428
aVIs this possible in the current state of Android
p45429
aVYou can create an Android library project that does not distribute Java source code
p45430
aVJust replace the  directory with a JAR in the library project's  directory
p45431
aVActually, to be accurate, you do need an empty  directory -- if it's missing, the build tools will get cranky
p45432
aVHowever, all of your resources (e
p45433
ag198
aV, layouts) have to be distributed as "open source"
p45434
aVAnd your Java code will not be able to use  or , since the code will not be recompiled as part of building the host project
p45435
aVInstead, you will need to use reflection or  to look up these IDs at runtime given their names, and that is expensive enough that you will also need to think about caching those lookups
p45436
aVYour customer will have to add the library project to theirs like any other library project, which will include adding entries into their manifest for each activity or other component that you are shipping that they are using
p45437
aVHowever, there is one aspect of this that you perhaps haven't thought all the way through:
p45438
aVfull activities that support intent actions
p45439
aVThe "support intent actions" part is not a good idea
p45440
aVUsers will find where you live and will burn you at the stake if their phones get cluttered up with 10 copies of the same activity for handling the same action, because they happened to install 10 apps that happen to all use your library
p45441
aVAnd if the users don't get to you, the developers will, when 90% of the time their apps break because the user chose the copy of the activity from another application
p45442
aVAny components you ship MUST be designed to be used completely within the application itself by default -- IOW, no  elements

p45815
aVThe app I am developing is a chat client and needs a constant connection, it is also plugin based, so my app is developed as such: Client - HostService - Multiple child 'Services'

p45819
aVIf the client itself is open the issue does not occur, but the model I am going for is that the user can use the device and stay connected (receiving messages etc) without having the client itself open at all times

aVYou may think it's sexy

aVYou may be hurting yourself by having it, as it may accelerate Android's interest in getting rid of your service
p45828
aVYou absolutely are hurting users by having it, because you are wasting RAM for no good reason
p45829
aVThen, I'd get rid of the plugins, if you implemented those as separate applications
p45830
aVIn that case, each one of those will be running in its own process, wasting yet more RAM
p45831
aVBesides, your current implementation would be flawed, as you would be stuck having your service be named  until the end of time, since you didn't use an  to separate the concerns of "what the service is named internally" and "what the service is called by other separately-installed applications that wish to use it"

p45835

aVYou assume that there is a single "android way"
p46812

p46813
aVYou can either bind, or send commands via
p46814
aVShould I do my non-persistent caching in this service or somewhere else
p46815
aVIf you're sure that you only want it to be in RAM, I'd lean towards static data members
p46816
aVMake the service be the "do-er", not the store
p46817
aVThat being said, I'd treat this more as a synchronization pattern, with the real store being a database or directory, with a cache in RAM
p46818
aVUsers will find this less frustrating -- under your current plan, if they are in your app, then take a phone call for a while, they'll have to have you download all the data again
p46819
aVDo I need AIDL, or can I just use normal objects for moving data between a service and an activity
p46820
aVIf they are all in the same process, normal objects is fine via binding, or use  extras for the command pattern
p46821
aVNow, back to:
p46822
aVHow do I do this the android way
p46823
aVOption #1: Wrap your store in a  and use  for changes
p46824
aVOption #2: Have your service send a broadcast to your package when the data changes, so the foreground activity can find out about the change via a  registered via
p46825
aVOther activities simply grab a fresh look at the data in  -- the only one that immediately needs to know of the data change is the one the user is interacting with, if any
p46826
aVOption #3: Use the binding pattern with the service, and have the foreground activity register a listener with the service
p46827
aVThe service calls the listener when data is updated
p46828
aVOnce again, ather activities simply grab a fresh look at the data in
p46829
aVOption #4: Cook up your own listener system as part of your static data members, being very very careful to avoid memory leaks (e

VQuoting myself from one of my books:
p46865
aVAndroid's TextView class has the built-in ability to "ellipsize" text,
p46866
aVtruncating it and adding an ellipsis if the text is longer than the available
p46867
aVspace
p46868
aVYou can use this via the android:ellipsize attribute, for example
p46869
aVThis works fairly well, at least for single-line text
p46870
aVThe ellipsis that Android uses is not three periods
p46871
aVRather it uses an actual
p46872
aVellipsis character, where the three dots are contained in a single glyph
p46873
aVHence, any font that you use that you also use the "ellipsizing" feature will
p46874
aVneed the ellipsis glyph
p46875
aVBeyond that, though, Android pads out the string that gets rendered on-screen, such that the length (in characters) is the same before and after
p46876
aV"ellipsizing"
p46877
aVTo make this work, Android replaces one character with the
p46878
aVellipsis, and replaces all other removed characters with the Unicode
p46879
aVcharacter 'ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE' (U+FEFF)
p46880
aVThis means the
p46881
aV"extra" characters after the ellipsis do not take up any visible space on
p46882
aVscreen, yet they can be part of the string
p46883
aVHowever, this means any custom fonts you use for TextView widgets that
p46884
aVyou use with android:ellipsize must also support this special Unicode
p46885
aVcharacter
p46886
aVNot all fonts do, and you will get artifacts in the on-screen

p47414
aVIn Android, your user interface is comprised of an activity, holding onto views (and ignoring fragments for the moment)
p47415
aVWhen "certain conditions arise", whatever is causing those "certain conditions" to "arise" (, , act of , whatever) should notify the activity of that event

p47419
aVThis is lighter weight, less coding, and easier to maintain
p47420
aVYou do not need a static data member for this
p47421
aVThe activity already has its views, though you may wish to maintain a (non-static) cache inside the activity for easy access to those views that need this event

p47427
aVNone of that needs a set of , nor a static data member

aVIt is all inside one activity
p47429
aVIn a background thread and being triggered by a timer, I consume a web service which provides the weather in the given cities
p47430
aVWhen the weather changes, I'd go to my static handler list and find out which cities need to update their image and then trigger that "event" to take place
p47431
aVIf the "background thread" is simply forked by the activity, you do not need a static data member, nor a bunch of
p47432

p48191
aVYou can convert your "php app into an iphone/android app", and PhoneGap might be part of your solution
p48192
aVYou would start by getting rid of all the "php" -- if your "app" can run purely in a browser using local storage, it will almost assuredly work with PhoneGap

aV44% of Android applications do not need a service that runs continuously, let alone one that starts doing so at boot time
p48621
aVAndroid device users hate developers who think that their apps are sooooooooooooo important that they have services running all the time -- that's why we have task killers, Force Stop, and Android killing services due to old age

aV"External storage" means "mountable storage" -- IOW, the user has access to that storage when they plug their device into a host machine via a USB cable

Vmy understanding is that a callback is code you provide in one process that's executed when another process reaches a certain result
p50245
aVNot exactly
p50246
aVWikipedia describes a callback as "a reference to executable code, or a piece of executable code, that is passed as an argument to other code"
p50247
aVThat's probably the best use of the term
p50248
aVIn this case, since Java operations come in the form of methods, a "callback method" is a method that will be invoked as a result of a callback
p50249
aVIs this a callback because it's only called when the user does something (in this case, click on a list item)
p50250
aVNot exactly
p50251
aVIt is a callback method because other pieces of the Android framework are detecting an event (in this case, the user tapping on an item in a list) and are calling the  callback method to give you control
p50252
aVBut if that's so, can't any event be considered a callback in that it's only called when something outside of itself happens
p50253
aVUsually, "callback" is reserved for cases where there's a clearly defined opaque boundary between the module detecting the event and the module implementing the callback to process the event
p50254
aVIn this case, you did not write the Android operating system, and so  is a callback into your own code that the OS will call to let you process list item clicks

aVYou cannot write a service that will "keep running in the background" very long
p50268
aVThat is because developers have tried writing services that "keep running in the background", causing problems for users

aVBinding is twitchy -- if you unbind from the old activity, and nothing else is keeping the service around, the service will shut down before the new activity gets a chance to bind

VHow significant would the difference be
p50850
aVAFAIK, Titanium will generate Objective C, so unless their stuff is woefully inefficient, I wouldn't expect speed to be a major issue
p50851
aVAre there other reasons to not use Titanium (or equivalent)
p50852
aVWell, that depends on how you define "equivalent"
p50853
aVPersonally, when I get into cross-platform apps, I expect that I will use PhoneGap
p50854
aVThat's for one reason: standards
p50855
aVWith PhoneGap, you're writing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as if you were writing an HTML5 offline app
p50856
aVAll PhoneGap does is turn that into an installable package (e
p50857
ag198
aV, APK for Android) and give you opt-in proprietary APIs for getting to device-specific stuff
p50858
aVTheir expectation is to simply fill in the "gap" between what HTML5 on mobile supports and what native apps on mobile supports
p50859
aVHeck, it's even in their name
p50860
aV:-)
p50861
aVAs a result, what you are writing is the same sort of tech you would use for a Web-based app, and it may even get to share some of the client-side code
p50862
aVYou can use whatever you like from mobile frameworks (e
p50863
ag198
aV, Sencha Touch, jQuery Mobile)
p50864
aVAnd, if someday app stores support HTML5 offline apps, you might even be able to drop PhoneGap altogether, if you're not heavily dependent upon the device integration features
p50865
aVTitanium lets you write in JavaScript, but the standards compliance largely ends there
p50866
aVYou're using proprietary APIs for everything, including the whole UI
p50867
aVPersonally, I'd rather back a more popular horse -- HTML5 in this case, more so than PhoneGap specifically
p50868
aVIf for no other reason, it'll be way easier to hire HTML5-savvy developers than Titanium-savvy developers
p50869
aVNeither PhoneGap, nor Titanium, nor any of the plethora of other options (e
p50870
ag198
aV, Rhodes, Flash/AIR) give you all of the device capabilities
p50871
aVThese engines will vary in their extensibility -- I know that PhoneGap has a plugin model, that Flash/AIR is pretty much only what you get from Adobe, and I'm not sure about any others
p50872
aVTitanium has one advantage: you get a near-native UI, instead of an HTML-based UI
p50873
aV(I say "near-native" because some of their widgets do not necessarily have native equivalents on all platforms, so they roll their own as needed) For some apps and some audiences, that alone may tilt things in Titanium's favor

aVWhat network calls are required to show a well-formatted RSS feed
p51313

p51314

p51315
aVHowever, if you spend the time to research what "RSS" and "network calls" mean, you will learn that they are largely unrelated

aVI can give you an RSS feed in the form of a piece of paper, for example

p51332
aVFinally, I'd like some logging to be available to me, for instance I'd like to be able to keep track of the websites visited on the device
p51333
aVIf you are letting them use a browser, then they can arrange to run any application they want on the device
p51334
aVAnd, BTW, the logging you want is impossible except by creating custom firmware or writing your own Web browser
p51335
aVI know there are apps out there that do these sort of things
p51336
aVName any
p51337
aVis something like this possible (either logging or locking)
p51338
aVIt is all possible if you create your own custom rendition of the Android OS and put it on either your own custom-crafted hardware or find ways to load it on existing hardware
p51339
aVThe closest thing to this you can do with just the Android SDK, as @Aaron C notes, is create your own custom home screen
p51340
aVFrom here, you control what apps the user can launch from this screen (but, again, a Web page could bypass this, as will anything that raises a )
p51341
aVBy setting your app as the home screen, you have some limited control over user behavior
p51342
aVBut, a safe-mode reboot of the device will restore the firmware's own home screen, let alone all the other holes that I mentioned
p51343
aVAnd none of this achieves your logging functionality
p51344
aVAndroid is designed explicitly to empower the person who holds the device
p51345
aVEnterprises and malware authors have the same objective: take control from the user and give that control to somebody else

p52355
aVSo, I'm going to outline a whole mess of scenarios and hope that one of them actually hits whatever problem you think you have
p52356
aVScenario A: Only The Activity
p52357
aVIf you only need to receive the broadcast when you have an activity in the foreground, have the activity register the  using
p52358
aVAs @MisterSquonk indicated, you would register the receiver in  and unregister it in
p52359
aVScenario B: Activity If In Foreground, Else Other; Ordered Broadcast
p52360
aVIf you want the foreground activity to handle the broadcast, but you want something else to happen if that activity is not in the foreground (e
p52361
ag198
aV, raise a ), and the broadcast is an ordered broadcast (e
p52362
ag198
aV, incoming SMS), then you would still use the Scenario A solution, but with a higher-priority  (see )
p52363
aVIn addition, you would register a  via a  element in the manifest, with a lower-priority  for the same broadcast
p52364
aVIn the activity's , call  to consume the event and prevent it from reaching your manifest-registered
p52365
aVScenario C: Activity If In Foreground, Else Other; Regular Broadcast
p52366
aVIf Scenario B almost fits, but the broadcast you are listening for is not an ordered broadcast, you will need to start with Scenario B
p52367
aVHowever, have the broadcast that both receivers have in their respective filters be one of your own, using a private action string as @MisterSquonk suggested
p52368
aVIn addition, have another  registered in the manifest, whose  is for the real broadcast you're listening for
p52369
aVThat receiver would simply call  to send out the ordered broadcast that the other receivers are listening on
p52370
aVScenario D: Activity Regardless of Foreground
p52371
aVIf some activity of yours needs to know about the broadcast, and it does not matter whether or not it is in the foreground, you need to rethink what you mean by that
p52372
aVUsually, this really means that the broadcast affects your data model in some way, in which case your concern should not be to let the activities know, but rather to update your data model, and use your already-existing "let the activities know about the data model change" logic handle the rest
p52373
aVIf, however, you are convinced that this is not part of your data model, you can implement Scenario B or Scenario C, plus stick some information in a static data member
p52374
aVYour activities can examine that static data member in  to pick up the information about the broadcast when they return to the foreground
p52375
aVIf you're thinking "but, what if my process is terminated between the broadcast and the other activity coming to the foreground
p52376
aV, then your broadcast really is updating your data model, per the opening paragraph of this scenario
p52377
aVIf you're thinking "but, I want to update an activity that is doing work in the background", then the activity in question is broken
p52378
aVActivities should never be doing work in the background
p52379
aVThat work should be delegated to some form of service, and there's a whole related set of scenarios for getting a broadcast to the service

p53163
aVYou cannot block other applications or the OS from logging, short of writing your own firmware

aVConsidering that the logging area is a 64KB ring buffer, devices will have more than 10K messages in them much of the time, as most messages are short
p53166
aVThe workaround for this is to clear the logs once we hit this point and we can then see all the logs again

aVThe speed is tied some to screen resolution and some to the increased reliance on hardware graphics acceleration in Honeycomb
p54284
aVGetting a device with the same screen resolution (1024 x 600) as the Fire would seem to be the most obvious thing to look for
p54285
aVYou are certainly welcome to purchase such a device, assuming you can find one
p54286

p54287
aVWe don't know for certain what Android version it runs

p54318
aVThis is not strictly possible, on a variety of fronts
p54319
aVLet's take them one piece at a time:
p54320
aVThis must happen regularly (approx every 1-5mins)
p54321
aVYou may not be able to get locations, period, let alone every 1-5 minutes
p54322
aVThe user might have all location providers disabled
p54323
aVThe user might have the device in airplane mode
p54324
aVThe user might be in a large building (blocking GPS) with poor connectivity (making the network provider unreliable)
p54325
aVnever stopping
p54326
aVThe user can always get rid of you via the Manage Services screen in Settings or a task killer
p54327
aVIf they do so, particularly on Android 3
p54328
aV1+, your app will never run again for any reason until the user starts an activity of yours (e
p54329
ag198
aV, via the launcher)
p54330
aVThe user could also uninstall your app, of course
p54331
aVprotected against the OS shutting processes down to reclaim memory
p54332
aVYou cannot guarantee against this
p54333
aVYou can reduce the odds, but that is it
p54334
aVNow, let's look at your various solutions:
p54335
aVUse a service to collect location events and handle them
p54336
aVFrom the way you phrase this (and subsequent sentences), you mean an everlasting service, one that is designed to run 24x7
p54337
aVBy definition, this means that your app is running, which violates one of your rules
p54338
aVAssuming you relax this rule, this solution massively increases the odds that the user will get rid of your service, and it increases the odds that Android will get rid of your service
p54339
aVYou can minimize the latter by use of
p54340
aVALARMS
p54341
aVI gather these can be shut down when memory is short
p54342
aVNot that I am aware of
p54343
aVHowever, if the user gets rid of you, your alarms will be removed
p54344
aVThis seems an ugly solution as the locations will arrive on a schedule anyway
p54345
aVNo, they will not
p54346
aVThe time parameter on  does not mean that "locations will arrive on a schedule anyway"
p54347
aVLocations delivered via a broadcast intent would mean I can then handle the location events in a broadcast receiver
p54348
aVNo, you cannot
p54349
aVYou have indicated that part of your work will be to send this data to a server
p54350
aVYou cannot reliably do that on the main application thread, as it may take too long
p54351
aVA  , pointing to an  would be more reliable
p54352
aVWill these location alerts continue indefinitely
p54353
aVNo
p54354
aVSee below
p54355
aVWill anything other than device shutdown or the app turning them off cause them to stop
p54356
aVThe user can get rid of your app (uninstall, task killer, Manage Services)
p54357
aVThe user can disable location providers
p54358
aVThe user may enter an area where the location cannot be determined
p54359
aVEtc
p54360
aVAlso, the device may fall asleep, AFAIK
p54361
aVIt's possible the system keeps a  for the duration of your registered request for updates
p54362
aVIt's even possible that the system will use  internally to arrange to wake itself up on your supplied period, so it does not have to keep the device awake continuously
p54363
aVHowever, you will want to test this thoroughly

aVWhether it will help you is another matter entirely, as I am not aware that you can change actual app widget size on the fly this way
p54411
aVSetting the size to 3x3 solves the problem, but then the widgets takes a lot of unnecessary space
p54412
aVYou are the one who is trying to force a particular pixel size (or, at least, aspect ratio)
p54413
aVThis will be fragile, as you are discovering
p54414
aVFurthermore, app widget cells are not guaranteed to be the same size on all devices and home screen implementations
p54415
aVHence, you are either going to need to choose an app widget size that gives you tons of extra space (your 3x3 scenario), or design a fluid app widget layout that adapts to the actual size that you are given (and therefore will not be square)

p54711
aVThis has several advantages:

p55362
aVUsing an old target API level will increasingly confuse users who are used to applications that are up to date
p55363
aVRight now, there are certainly plenty of applications that are not targeting API Level 11 or higher and therefore have the system bar MENU button
p55364
aVThat will change over the next year
p55365
aVEventually, a preponderance of users will have no idea how to access your menu, because they will not notice this funny-looking icon that appears in the system bar or not know what it does
p55366
aVSome of these users will wonder why you don't have a menu in the upper-right corner like most of their other applications
p55367
aVIf you don't want an action bar, you can roll your own upper-right-corner menu, using an  and , for example

p55765
aVDoing this requires calling []
p55766
aVThe simplest answer is for you to call  on the  instead of the
p55767
aVThe result should be directed back to the fragment's own
p55768
aVThat being said, your approach appears to be a near-complete inversion over what I recommend
p55769
aVFragments should not be starting activities
p55770
aVA fragment should neither know nor care how a particular UI event (e
p55771
ag198
aV, button click) is handled for things that are outside the fragment itself
p55772
aVIn this case, the activity should be responsible for obtaining the contact, with the fragment simply telling the activity "hey, this here button gots pressed, yo, and gimme a contact back"
p55773
aVNot only is this important for separation of concerns, but it is important for testing, so you can test this behavior with mocked contact selections and such
p55774
aVDepending on how I include that fragment in my Activity layout, it may be several layers deep in other UI fragments
p55775
aVYou cannot nest fragments in fragments in Android
p55776
aVIf you try, you will get unreliable results
p55777
aVI don't want the top level UI to care about how the fragment is constructed at all
p55778
aVActivities absolutely must know how the fragment is constructed, since the activity is the one doing the constructing
p55779
aVOff the cuff, here is how I would approach it:
p55780
aVEstablish a listener interface for UI events raised by the fragment that transcend the bounds of the fragment itself
p55781
aVFor the purposes of this answer, I'll call this
p55782
aVWhen the activity creates/configures the fragment, the activity supplies a  instance to the fragment
p55783
aVThat could be the activity itself, if the activity implements the interface
p55784
aVEstablish a listener interface for the asynchronous pick-a-contact event that the fragment would like somebody to perform on its behalf
p55785
aVFor the purposes of this answer, I'll call this
p55786
aVIt would have a method like  containing the  of the selected contact
p55787
aVOn , have something like  that will be called when the user clicks the button
p55788
aVwould take an  instance as a parameter
p55789
aVThe activity would do the  call and, in , call the associated  method on the
p55790
aVThe activity would cache those in a  or something while the request was in process
p55791
aVNow, we have clear separation between the activity and the fragment
p55792
aVThe fragment can still be hosted by any number of activities (e

VI'm struggling to associate my app with a particular file type (
p55877
aVstl)
p55878
aVGenerally, Android does not use file extensions to indicate type
p55879
aVAndroid uses MIME types to indicate type
p55880
aVWhen trying to launch a file from a file manager, my app isn't one of the options suggested
p55881
aVWell, the only guaranteed-solid answer is:
p55882
aVStep #1: Determine the MIME type that  files are associated with
p55883
aVStep #2: Use that MIME type in your  element for the  attribute
p55884
aVStep #3: Force each and every file manager author to implement support for your MIME type for when they encounter  files
p55885
aVStep #3, of course, is the problem
p55886
aVAndroid, like iOS and other operating systems, are trying desperately to hide the concept of "files" from the user
p55887
aVThat is why there is no file manager built into Android, why few devices bundle one, and why there is little support for the concept in the OS
p55888
aVYou are welcome to try to use  in your  element to support things based on file extension, though I'm not sure if that works well
p55889
aVYou might also need  in that element -- Android itself does not use  for the  scheme, and the third-party code I am examining shows the element both ways
p55890
aVAgain, I have no idea if it works

aVIt all depends on what your code base looks like and whether or not there is a clean separation between components
p56393
aVYou did not indicate what you mean by "multiple versions of the same application", and so it is even more difficult to tell you whether Android library projects will help you with whatever "multiple versions of the same application" means to you

aVAndroid won't like the Swing code; standard Java won't know what to do with the Android code

aVI suggest that you reorganize your code base into three:

p56511
aVOne is the rest of your existing Swing/command-line logic, which uses the JAR

aVThe rule, however, is not universal, as the document you cite goes to great pains to try to explain at the outset
p57222
aVThat document outlines "micro-optimizations"
p57223
aVThese, as the document states, "will almost never make or break your software"
p57224
aVRather, they are things that you may wish to optimize in particular places that need it
p57225
aVYou do not need to avoid internal getters and setters unless they are causing specific performance problems
p57226
aVYou can usually determine this by using Traceview and seeing lots of time spent in the getters and setters
p57227
aVSo, for example, in a tight loop over a large data set, trying to avoid getters and setters is probably worthwhile
p57228

aVSuppose the user leaves your app (e

ag198
aV, presses HOME) and does not return to your app for an hour, or a day, or a month
p57257
aVAny data that the user would reasonably expect to stick around for that period of time needs to be saved in a persistent data store, such as a database or flat file
p57258
aVIt is your job to determine when that data gets saved -- perhaps it is when the user presses a Save button, or perhaps it is in  of an activity, or perhaps it is at some other time
p57259
aVData that is tied to the current contents of the screen, but does not need to be saved for a month of absence, can be held onto via
p57260
aVHopefully you are already using this to handle screen rotations

ag198
aV, a phone call comes in, then a text message comes in, then they click on a link in a text message and bring up the Web browser, and later BACK all the way back to your app, which had been terminated in the meantime), your saved instance state will be restored
p57263
aVEverything else -- instance data members of an activity, or static data members, or whatever -- may get lost if the user leaves the app, if Android elects to terminate your process

VWell, im developing and app for api 8 with TabActivity but i found out today that "This class is deprecated
p57856
aVIn Android, "deprecated" usually means "we will continue to maintain this as long as we can, but there are better options that you should consider"
p57857

p57858
aVx and higher, and on Android 2
p57859
aVx on down using something like ActionBarSherlock

p57921
aVFor  alarms, yes, as that is the only path in which we are guaranteed to get control while the device is still awake
p57922
aVSince the work to be done by the  alarm is typically beyond the scope of what you can safely do in  of a manifest-registered , a common pattern is to delegate the work to an

p57970
aVYou can use the  object to see if the device's hardware keyboard is hidden

p57979
aVThe user is perfectly capable of switching keyboards if they wish
p57980
aVThe user is perfectly capable of making these decisions
p57981
aVIt is entirely possible that an alternative keyboard is more secure than a built-in one, due to devices loaded with spyware from the factor, such as CarrierIQ
p57982
aVHence, your assumption that you are improving security by attacking the user's choice of keyboard is fundamentally flawed
p57983

p59087
aVOh, no, wait, you didn't literally mean for me to say that

p59089
aVShould FragA implement OnItemClickListener for the ListView (some networking business is performed on press), or FragActivityA
p59090

p59094
aVShould FragA show a DialogFragment, or should there be a callback to FragActivityA to show it
p59095
aVIdeally, neither
p59096
aVDesign your UI to lock the user out of pieces of the activity, not the whole activity
p59097
aVIOW, minimize your use of dialogs
p59098
aVRegardless, my general guidance is that the fragment handles all work that is limited to the scope of the fragment itself (and its underlying data model)
p59099
aVEvents that transcend multiple fragments should be rippled up to the activity, which would then be responsible for either passing the event to another existing fragment (if it's loaded by this activity) or by starting another activity
p59100
aVIn MVC terms, your fragment is your controller, with the activity handling orchestration events between fragments (and, hence, between activities if needed)
p59101
aVNow, if the answers to the above are yes, FragActivityA needs to include most methods of FragActivityB, duplicating most of the code

p59804
aVThat is an internal implementation detail that SDK developers should not worry about

p59806
aVI'll take your word for that
p59807
aVJava does not behave this way
p59808
aVThe JVM does not care how much system memory exists -- it only cares about its potential heap size (e

aV, ) for its own VM, at most
p59810
aVScanning the following LogCat however seems to show Dalvik GC running at least in part quite often
p59811
aVCorrect
p59812
aVParticularly on newer versions of Android, the GC runs concurrently in its own thread, rather than the stop-the-world approach taken earlier on
p59813
aVThis doesn't make sense to me since GC recently ran and nothing allocated since should have brought the VM within 3MB of capacity (256 MB)
p59814
aVIt is highly unlikely that you have 256MB of heap space for your VM
p59815
aVDepending on your device, it may be as low as 16MB
p59816
aVMoreover, Android does not have a compacting GC algorithm, and so even though you may have more than 3MB available, you may not have a contiguous 3MB block

aVIs there only a small percentage of that 256 MB system RAM which is actually given to the VM before it crashes
p59823
aVYes
p59824
aVIt's called the heap
p59825
aVAndroid devices have a heap size limit
p59826
aVTypically, it is in the 16-48MB range, depending on Android OS version and screen resolution
p59827
aVCould it be that the Bitmap loading process has its own memory allocation cap
p59828
aVNo, it works off of the same heap size budget
p59829
aVStarting with Android 3
p59830
aV0, it really loads the memory out of the same heap as the rest of the Dalvik objects use -- previously, it used blocks of system RAM outside of the heap, but the space was counted against the heap's size budget
p59831

p59835
aVI'd like to know if there is a supported API call somewhere which can be relied upon in production code (not just debug) to track the precise state of the garbage collector
p59836
aVNo
p59837
aVIs GC always system-wide, or can separate threads (such as a dedicated rendering thread for a game) escape the potential performance lag issues caused by GC
p59838
aVGC is never "system-wide" for any VM
p59839
aVGC is always within a VM
p59840
aVOn newer versions of Android, GC is concurrent and therefore will not materially block any thread in normal circumstances

aVTo clarify: As inazaruk posted and I put into comments on other answers, all applications, upon installation, are placed in a "stopped" state

p60007
aVPlease don't
p60008
aVFor starters, it is not possible
p60009
aVUsers complain loudly and often about services that "run 24*7", because the services are tying up system resources (e
p60010

p60011
aVAs a result, between third-party task killers and Force Stop options in Settings, users get rid of such services
p60012
aVWhen they do, particularly on Android 3
p60013
aV1+, your application will not run again, ever until the user manually launches an activity of yours from the launcher
p60014
aVAndroid itself will get rid of such services on its own, because too many developers are too sloppy with their service management
p60015
aVAnd on Start & On mobile low battery and Hit a webservice every 1hr
p60016
aVBased on this list, you do not need "a background service in Android mobile which runs 24*7"
p60017
aVYou need to do work:
p60018
aVwhen the device starts up
p60019

p60020

p60022

p60023
aVYou can find out when time elapses via , where you establish your own alarm schedule (e

p60025
aVAll three of these triggers should call  on an

aVOne is responsible for loading the  and, if there is room, the detail fragment
p60067
aVThe other only loads the detail fragment -- this activity would be started by the first one if the user taps on a list entry and the detail fragment is not displayed by the first activity
p60068
aVUsually my activities play the role of the 'controller' (according to the MVC paradigm) but, as of the above question, I would have three controllers
p60069
aVIMHO, with fragments, the fragment is your controller
p60070
aVActivities are an orchestration layer determining which fragments are visible and handling cross-fragment events
p60071
aVBut then; how can I - in a well defined manner - find out what type of device (tablet/handset) my application is running on
p60072
aVThe simplest solution in many cases is to drive it by layout XML resources
p60073
aVFor example, in my above recommendation, the first activity could have two different versions of, say,
p60074
aVOne () loads just the

aVThe other (say, ) loads the  and the detail fragment, or loads the  and a  container for a dynamic detail fragment (one you would define via a )

aVI've been able to put together a FragmentActivity that separates the app into a top fragment, middle viewpager controlled by the FragmentActivity, and bottom fragment but this seems like it wouldn't be the best approach as the fragments are not activities themselves and replacing the view pager with a new activity would require replacing the entire FragmentActivity itself

VSo far I have my app which is taking a picture and then using an Intent to carry the picture over and display in a new Activity
p61534
aVIn most cases, passing data between activities using  extras is a fine solution
p61535
aVLarge bitmaps, though, cause problems that way due to memory consumption

p61539
aVOutOfMemoryError: bitmap size exceeds VM budget(Heap Size=7431KB, Allocated=2956KB, Bitmap Size=19764KB) which I think means that the image is too large
p61540
aVIt means that you do not have enough memory for whatever it is you are trying to do
p61541
aVLooking through the code I think it searches for the smallest resouloution/size and then takes the camera using those settings am I right in thinking that
p61542
aVYes
p61543
aVif so how can I implement that into my code
p61544
aVCopy and paste usually works
p61545
aV:-)
p61546
aVTo tell the camera what size picture to take, use  on
p61547
aVHowever, you have to choose a size it supports, and not all devices will support arbitrary sizes
p61548
aVCalling  will tell you which sizes are supported
p61549
aVIt is up to you to determine which of those sizes to use
p61550
aVIn the example I linked to from your other question, I iterate over those sizes and find the smallest one in terms of area
p61551
aVThat being said, if the only issue with image size is passing it from activity to activity, I would go the static data member route first
p61552
aVJust be sure to  out that static data member when you no longer need the image
p61553
aVSomething like this maybe
p61554
aVAgain, that depends on what your objective is
p61555
aVYou seem to be flailing around looking for solutions, when you have only articulated one problem (and, even there, you have not told us where you are getting the out of memory error)

p61587
aVFor that "this", use an ordered broadcast
p61588
aVAs I wrote in a blog post from a ways back, here is the recipe for either notifying a foreground activity or raising a :
p61589
aVDefine an action string you will use when the event occurs that you want to go to the activity or notification (e
p61590
ag198
aV, )
p61591
aVDynamically register a  in your activity, with an  set up for the aforementioned action string and with a positive priority (the default priority for a filter is 0)
p61592
aVThis receiver should then have the activity do whatever it needs to do to update the UI based on this event
p61593
aVThe receiver should also call  to prevent others from getting it
p61594
aVBe sure to register the receiver in  or  and unregister the receiver in the corresponding  or  method

p61641
aVIn the individual submission, the client can get the files when he wants if he wants them
p61642
aVIf you mean that they might be requesting them over a substantial period of time, this will not be able to leverage
p61643

p61644
aVIt is impossible to tell you, in the abstract, which will be better for battery consumption
p61645
aVIs the effect on battery life so great that it would be a valid option to overstep on bandwidth
p61646
aVThat would depend on how much you are downloading, how frequently, etc
p61647
aVHowever, IMHO, you are focusing on the wrong problem

aVThis method returns a , which needs to be  if there is more data yet to be fetched,  otherwise

aVIf, on the other hand, you have more work than a few milliseconds' worth, you will need to have that work be done by something else that can do the work on a background thread

p62846
aVThe service would work perfectly for awhile, but then eventually it would be killed

aVAn  automatically goes away once  returns, and that ideally should occur within a handful of seconds

p62852

p62874
aVNot only is it a good idea, but it is your only real option
p62875
aVHere is a sample project showing a (fake) audio client sending commands to a (fake) audio service that handles the playback and indicates to Android that the service is part of the user's foreground experience
p62876
aVI also thought that the answer might lay in static variables, however I assume that once an application has been exited (or force quit/killed for memory/whatever) even these objects are lost
p62877
aVOnce your process is terminated, the object is gone
p62878
aVOf course, so is the audio playback

aVA service is effectively a marker, to the OS, indicating that you have code that is still running, so Android is less likely to terminate your process to free up RAM to run other apps

p63303
aVAs an addendum, the way it works now is that you have to acquire a partial wake lock

aVThis guarantees that the CPU will not enter sleep mode and that will guarantee that

aVthe sensors continue sending data as expected
p63306
aVThe underlying problem was that,
p63307
aVbasically, a partial wake lock would not guarantee that the sensors would continue

p63309
aVI am led to believe using the partial wake lock will drain a battery fast
p63310
aVIt keeps the CPU powered on
p63311
aVIn normal operation, the CPU is the second biggest power drain, after the screen (GPS might also be more, but usually that is powered down)

aVAlways make sure to disable sensors you don't need, especially when your activity is paused

VI'm trying to figure out if the Status bar (the one that has the Home and Back buttons) is consistant across devices
p64058
aVIt is not even consistent on the same device
p64059
aVOne example: if you plug a WXGA device into a television via HDMI and hold it in landscape, the system bar will grow a bit, so that the space outside the system bar will be exactly 720p (1280x720, with an 80px high system bar)

p64706
aVThat is rather strange behavior
p64707
aVWhy are you doing this
p64708
aVOnce the user interacts with the new instance, the program will crash because the background version is already running, causing conflicts
p64709
aVThen whatever was being done in the original activity should not be in an activity at all, but in a service
p64710
aVOnce you no longer have a foreground activity, the odds of Android terminating your process to free up memory is fairly high and may occur rather quickly, depending on what else is going on
p64711
aVYou seem to be depending upon that older activity somehow still doing something
p64712
aVA "background version" of an activity should not be doing anything that would impact any other activity in your process, and an activity not in the foreground should not be responsible for doing anything that the user might miss if the activity goes "poof"
p64713
aVThat being said, there are other reasons to avoid having a second copy of your activity, notably navigation -- as it stands, when the user presses BACK from the second copy of the activity, they will see the first copy, and get confused

aVGenerally, yes

p65956
aVHow do I write my app to run on just the device we install it on
p65957
aVPrevent users of the device from running anything else, by rolling your own custom firmware, making your app be the home screen, remove unnecessary additional apps from the firmware, etc
p65958
aVThis may limit the utility of your devices, will not work if you are trying to make your app available to arbitrary devices, etc
p65959
aVOr, cook up your own license management scheme akin to the LVL, and hope that nobody interested in pirating the app has enough skills to reverse engineer your code and snip out the license management stuff
p65960
aVDepending upon your customer base, you may have reasonable luck with this approach
p65961
aVThis is not significantly different than traditional enterprise software with license keys and the like
p65962
aVHence, it is entirely possible that firms who make license management stuff for desktop apps have commercial Android solutions available for license
p65963

aVHere is my interpretation of what you are asking:
p66997
aVI have an Android application that has a service
p66998
aVI have a separate SDK (JAR or Android library project)
p66999
aVI want users of the SDK to be able to call a function and have the APK containing the service be downloaded and installed
p67000
aVThis is possible, sorta
p67001
aVYou can have code in your JAR that either:
p67002
aVcall  on an   for the   pointing to your app on Google Play, or
p67003
aVdownloads an APK from some server of yours to external storage, then calls  on an   pointing to that downloaded APK, to kick off an install
p67004
aVIn either case, the user will need to get involved in the installation process -- you cannot install apps silently
p67005
aVAnd, in the latter case, you will be responsible for handling your own updates over time
p67006
aVThis also will tend to confuse the user, as they may not realize why your app is floating around their device, so you will need to be able to handle the case where they uninstall it
p67007
aVAlso, it is possible that on Android 3
p67008

p67009

VMost answer is, that a (Local)Service is for long running activities, that have to run even when the main activity is closed

p67242
aVNot without leaking memory
p67243
aVNever leak threads from a component
p67244
aVWhen an activity is destroyed, ensure all threads started by that activity will be closed quickly
p67245
aVI ran a couple of tests and I'm pretty sure that the Async Task lives as long as the process does

aVCorrect

VI don't understand how the setRetainInstance in Fragment could replace onRetainNonConfigurationInstance for the above situation
p67324
aVIf your fragment is dynamically added via a , and you call  on that fragment, when the device undergoes a configuration change, Android will retain the existing fragment instance and reuse it in the newly-created activity
p67325
aVIn all other cases, Android will discard the original fragment and create a brand-new fragment instance to go with the brand-new activity instance
p67326
aVIf your fragment instance is retained, all of its data members are retained, so your  will be retained, along with its configured  and everything else
p67327
aVSo, the key question is: is the data in your ArrayList part of your data model, or not
p67328
aVIf it is part of your data model, you probably should be persisting it somewhere (database, JSON file, etc
p67329

VIs there a safer, generalized way to enumerate all the storage media available

aVFrom the SDK standpoint, there is internal storage () and there is external storage ()
p67355
aVOn Android 1
p67356
aVx/2
p67357
aVx, those will be separate partitions; on Android 3
p67358
aV0+, they will be a single partition
p67359
aVBy definition, doing anything beyond what the SDK offers will be unsafe
p67360
aVThere are no guarantees about partition names, what their roles are, whether you can read from them, whether you can write to them, etc
p67361
aVEven if you were to build a database of all the possibilities (model, OS version, partitions, and their status), that database would be perpetually out of date vis a vis new devices and OS versions
p67362
aVYou may be able to get access to media files on other partitions by means of the MediaStore
p67363
aVFor example, some device manufacturers who offer an SD card in addition to on-board external storage index the SD card's files, so any media files contained on the SD card show up in the MediaStore
p67364
aVThis may allow you to consume content on other manufacturer-supplied partitions (e

p68253
aVIf the actual fragment does not need to change (i
p68254
ag641
aV, it is the same fragment class), I would have the activity call a method on that fragment rather than replace it (your scenario #2), assuming it exists
p68255
aVThat's much less expensive at runtime, and it's probably simpler to code as well
p68256
aVIf, however, the fragment might need to be a different one (e
p68257
ag198
aV, depending on what you click, there may be different fragments for different types of model objects represented in the list), then replacing the fragment will be needed (your scenario #1)
p68258
aVYou could optimize the case where the fragment happens for this event to be of the same class, though I'd focus first on getting it working just by replacing the fragment and worry about the optimization if/when you have the time and inclination
p68259
aVI'm not a fan of your #2 code structurally, though
p68260
aVIMHO, fragments should not be talking with other fragments directly
p68261
aVMy preferred pattern is for fragments to "stick to their knitting", focusing solely on things within their own widgets and models
p68262
aVFor events that affect other parts of the UI (e
p68263
ag198
aV, list click), have the fragment notify the activity (e
p68264
ag198
aV, via a listener interface)
p68265
aVThe activity is the one that knows which fragments should be around, as it is the one that created them in the first place
p68266
aVThe activity can then either talk to the other fragment (if it exists), create the other fragment (if there is room), or start up another activity
p68267

VI don't want to put "if HTC_HERO" style logic in my code (anyway, I'm sure other devices will have similar behaviour)

aVTo some extent, that is inevitable, if you are trying to reach 100% of devices running 100% of arbitrary ROM mods, because bugs will abound
p68373
aVOne hack might be to catch the exception and then re-invoke the setPreviewSize() method with swapped params, but I'm hoping to find a nicer way

aVIn theory, there should be some universal preview size code that determines the right size and configures the  accordingly

p68569
aVHere is how I would answer your questions:
p68570
aVDo I need to include a license somehow
p68571
aVAccording to 4
p68572
aV1 of the Apache 2
p68573
aV0 License, "You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License"
p68574
aVAn Android app that incorporates an Apache 2
p68575
aV0-licensed component probably counts as a Derivative Work, if for no other reason than the contents of that component are bundled into the APK file
p68576
aVTherefore, you probably should include the license file and let users know that portions of the app are licensed via that license
p68577
aVThat being said, my army of ninja-lawyers tends to be occupied on other pursuits, so I don't have them combing Google Play hunting for apps that use my components and do not include the license file
p68578
aVHow do I include the license for this
p68579
aVIs there a recommended way
p68580
aVThat's up to you
p68581
aVI'd probably put it in
p68582
aVYou might be able to get away with linking to the online copy
p68583
aVCan I basically use this in my project without worrying too much as I won't be making it open source
p68584
aVThat is difficult to answer in the abstract
p68585
aVJust thought perhaps on the about screen I need to highlight that I used a component and the license it uses
p68586
aVThat is a common approach for apps with a UI
p68587
aVAnother way to look at it: the developers of the component itself saved you a bunch of time and/or allowed you to do things that you otherwise would not have had as features of your app
p68588
aVAcknowledging their contributions -- whether by simply saying "portions were licensed Apache 2
p68589
aV0" and linking to the license, or additionally giving the developer a shout-out -- would seem to be reasonable compensation

aVFragments are responsible for a small section of the screen and any events that are purely contained within that small section of the screen
p69748
aVWhether the fragment is hosted Activity A or Activity B or Activity C, whether it is alongside other fragments or not, whether it is presently visible or not, and so on is not the fragment's responsibility
p69749
aVThat responsibility lies with the hosting activity (or activities, if the fragment is reused)
p69750
aVThe hosting activity knows the screen size and what should be done in terms of loading particular fragments onto the screen
p69751
aVAfter all, the rules may change
p69752
aVPerhaps the fragment is hidden on small/normal screens but visible on large/xlarge screens
p69753
aVOr, perhaps the fragment was initially used individually but later is loaded into a
p69754
aVOr, perhaps the fragment is being dynamically created as part of a  and added to the BACK stack, so the user can independently get rid of the fragment

p71266
aVBy default, activities are not exported, and no  can be used to launch them from a third-party app
p71267
aVAlso, your code will not even compile, as  is not in your project (it is in the "external app"), and so  does not exist
p71268
aVThe only way it will compile (and work successfully) is if both your app and the "external app" happen to have the same activity class in the same Java package, which is unlikely
p71269
aVsafer
p71270
aVThe author of the "external app" should be using  actions (your first scenario), as it is easier to keep those consistent in the face of refactoring code
p71271
aVYour second approach will break if the author of the "external app" refactors their code into sub-packages, renames the activity class, etc
p71272
aVBasically, the action name becomes the public API, if you will, of the activity (along with any documented extras)

aVIf you want the service to continue executing past the lifetime of the activity, you must use , and ensure that there is some path by which the user can indicate that they no longer want this service, so you know when to call

p72831
aVSince the database file format is different between SQLite and SQLCipher for Android, and since you want to ship an unencrypted database, you will have to do a few things

p72833
aVThen, use standard SQLCipher for Android to create an empty-but-encrypted database

p72884
aVThat is mostly up to Adobe
p72885
aVThe fact that Flash Lite is on the Hero is the first step
p72886
aVI was kinda expecting perhaps more announcements on this front as part of the recent push of devices -- one might think Adobe would have wanted to jump on the bandwagon at that point
p72887
aVIt might also be that they're waiting for a slightly faster crop of devices (e

p72889

p72892

p72893
aVFlash might be licensed widely and appear on many Android devices, but that does not mean Flash will be in the SDK or part of the SDK toolchain
p72894
aVThat's not really a limiting factor, any more than Microsoft's lack of support for Flash in their SDK/tools has hindered Flash on Windows
p72895

p72897
aVopinion
p72898

aVIf it is merely Flash in Web pages, it will not impact Android development much

VThis will eventually get to your question, but I first want to address a number of issues you raise in your various comments to the various answers already given at the time of this writing
p72913
aVI have no intention of changing your mind -- rather, these are here for others who come to read this post in the future
p72914
aVThe point is that I cannot allow for
p72915
aVAndroid to determine when my app is
p72916
aVgoing to be terminated
p72917
aVthat must be
p72918
aVthe choice of the user
p72919
aVMillions of people are perfectly happy with the model where the environment closes up the application as needed
p72920
aVThose users simply don't think about "terminating" the Android app, any more than they think about "terminating" a Web page or "terminating" a thermostat
p72921
aViPhone users are much the same way, in that pressing the iPhone button does not necessarily "feel" like the app was terminated, since many iPhone apps pick up where the user left off, even if the app really was shut down (since iPhone only allows one third-party app at a time, at present)
p72922
aVAs I said above, there is a lot of
p72923
aVthings going on in my app (data being
p72924
aVPUSHed to the device, lists with tasks
p72925
aVthat always should be there etc)
p72926
aVI don't know what "lists with tasks that always should be there" means, but the "data being PUSHed to the device" is a pleasant fiction and should not be done by an activity in any case
p72927
aVUse a scheduled task (via ) to update your data for maximum reliability
p72928
aVOur users log in and cant be doing
p72929
aVthat everytime they get a phonecall
p72930
aVand Android decides to kill the app
p72931
aVThere are many iPhone and Android applications that deal with this
p72932
aVUsually, it is because they hold onto logon credentials, rather than forcing users to log in every time manually
p72933
aVFor example, we want to check updates
p72934
aVwhen exiting the application
p72935
aVThat is a mistake on any operating system
p72936
aVFor all you know, the reason your application is being "exited" is because the OS is shutting down, and then your update process will fail mid-stream
p72937
aVGenerally, that's not a good thing
p72938
aVEither check updates on start or check updates totally asynchronously (e
p72939
ag198
aV, via a scheduled task), never on exit
p72940
aVSome comments suggest that hitting the
p72941
aVback button does not kill the app at
p72942
aVall (see link in my question above)
p72943
aVPressing the BACK button does not "kill the app"
p72944
aVIt finishes the activity that was on-screen when the user pressed the BACK button
p72945
aVIt should only terminate when the
p72946
aVUsers wants to terminate it - never
p72947
aVever any other way
p72948
aVIf you cant write
p72949
aVapps that behave like that in Android,
p72950
aVthen I think that android cant be used
p72951
aVfor writing real apps =(
p72952
aVThen neither can Web apps
p72953
aVOr WebOS, if I understand their model correctly (haven't had a chance to play with one yet)
p72954
aVIn all of those, users don't "terminate" anything -- they just leave
p72955
aViPhone is a bit different, in that it only presently allows one thing to run at a time (with a few exceptions), and so the act of leaving implies a fairly immediate termination of the app
p72956
aVIs there a way for me to really quit
p72957
aVthe application
p72958
aVAs everybody else told you, users (via BACK) or your code (via ) can close up your currently-running activity
p72959
aVUsers generally don't need anything else, for properly-written applications, any more than they need a "quit" option for using Web apps
p72960
aVNo two application environments are the same, by definition
p72961
aVThis means that you can see trends in environments as new ones arise and others get buried
p72962
aVFor example, there is a growing movement to try to eliminate the notion of the "file"
p72963
aVMost Web apps don't force users to think of files
p72964
aViPhone apps typically don't force users to think of files
p72965
aVAndroid apps generally don't force users to think of files
p72966
aVAnd so on
p72967
aVSimilarly, there is a growing movement to try to eliminate the notion of "terminating" an app
p72968
aVMost Web apps don't force the user to log out, but rather implicitly log the user out after a period of inactivity
p72969
aVSame thing with Android, and to a lesser extent, iPhone (and possibly WebOS)
p72970
aVThis requires more emphasis on application design, focusing on business goals and not sticking with an implementation model tied to a previous application environment
p72971
aVDevelopers who lack the time or inclination to do this will get frustrated with newer environments that break their existing mental model
p72972
aVThis is not the fault of either environment, any more than it is the fault of a mountain for storms flowing around it rather than through it
p72973
aVFor example, some development environments, like Hypercard and Smalltalk, had the application and the development tools co-mingled in one setup
p72974
aVThis concept did not catch on much, outside of language extensions to apps (e
p72975
ag198
aV, VBA in Excel, LISP in AutoCAD)
p72976
aVDevelopers who came up with mental models that presumed the existence of development tools in the app itself, therefore, either had to change their model or limit themselves to environments where their model would hold true
p72977
aVSo, when you write:
p72978
aVAlong with other messy things I
p72979
aVdiscovered, I think that developing
p72980
aVour app for Android is not going to
p72981
aVhappen
p72982
aVthat would appear to be for the best, for you, for right now
p72983
aVSimilarly, I would counsel you against attempting to port your application to the Web, since some of the same problems you have reported with Android you will find in Web apps as well (e
p72984
ag198
aV, no "termination")
p72985
aVOr, conversely, someday if you do port your app to the Web, you may find that the Web app's flow may be a better match for Android, and you can revisit an Android port at that time

p73000
aVSee here for an example
p73001
aVOption #2: Use conditional class loading, by creating an interface plus two implementations (one for an older API, one for a newer API), and loading the right implementation at runtime
p73002
