VI would second the recommendation for PCRE
p4
aVI have used it in C++ projects in Windows and it works great
p5
aVIt's free, even for building commercial software
p6
aVIt also implements something of a de facto standard regular expression language, which will be welcome to your users
p7
aVPCRE is of course Perl-compatible, and Python also uses the same library
p8
aVThe native PCRE interface is a bit awkward and very C-style, so it's probably worth writing a nice C++ wrapper around it

VOne of the debugging techniques that I use frequently (except in cases of the most extreme weirdness) is to divide and conquer
p17
aVIf your program currently fails with some specific error, then divide it in half in some way and see if it still has the same error
p18
aVObviously the trick is to decide where to divide your program
p19
aVYour example as given doesn't show enough context to determine where the error might be
p20
aVIf anybody else were to try your example, it would work fine
p21
aVSo, in your program, try removing as much of the extra stuff you didn't show us and see if it works then
p22
aVIf so, then add the other code back in a bit at a time until it starts failing
p23
aVThen, the thing you just added is probably the problem
p24
aVNote that if your program is multithreaded, then you probably have larger problems
p25
aVIf not, then you should be able to narrow it down in this way

p33
aVTheir request signatures do have some features (such as incorporating a timestamp) that help guard against both accidental and malicious request replaying
p34
aVThe nice thing about HTTP Basic is that virtually all HTTP libraries support it
p35
aVYou will, of course, need to require SSL in this case because sending plaintext passwords over the net is almost universally a bad thing
p36
aVBasic is preferable to Digest when using SSL because even if the caller already knows that credentials are required, Digest requires an extra roundtrip to exchange the nonce value
p37
aVWith Basic, the callers simply sends the credentials the first time
p38
aVOnce the identity of the client is established, authorization is really just an implementation problem
p39
aVHowever, you could delegate the authorization to some other component with an existing authorization model
p40
aVAgain the nice thing about Basic here is your server ends up with a plaintext copy of the client's password that you can simply pass on to another component within your infrastructure as needed

VWhen shifting left, there is no difference between arithmetic and logical shift
p47
aVWhen shifting right, the type of shift depends on the type of the value being shifted
p48
aV(As background for those readers unfamiliar with the difference, a "logical" right shift by 1 bit shifts all the bits to the right and fills in the leftmost bit with a 0
p49
aVAn "arithmetic" shift leaves the original value in the leftmost bit
p50
aVThe difference becomes important when dealing with negative numbers
p51
aVWhen shifting an unsigned value, the >> operator in C is a logical shift
p52

p72

p73
aVActually, other pieces of the puzzle you may need are fdopen and open_osfhandle
p74
aVIn fact, here's a related example from some code I released years ago:
p75
aVIn this case, the main process was a GUI process which doesn't start with stdio handles at all
p76
aVIt opens a console, then shoves the right handles into stdout and stdin so the debug() function (which was designed as a stdio interactive function) can interact with the newly created console

VThe line between "interpreted" and "compiled" languages is really fuzzy these days
p181
aVFor example, the first thing Python does when it sees source code is compile it into a bytecode representation, essentially the same as what Java does when compiling class files
p182
aVThis is what *
p183
aVpyc files contain
p184
aVThen, the python runtime executes the bytecode without referring to the original source
p185
aVTraditionally, a purely interpreted language would refer to the source code continuously when executing the program
p186
aVWhen building a language, it is a good approach to build a solid foundation on which you can implement the higher level functions
p187
aVIf you've got a solid, fast string handling system, then the language designer can (and should) implement something like stripslashes() outside the base runtime
p188
aVThis is done for at least a few reasons:
p189
aVThe language designer can show that the language is flexible enough to handle that kind of task
p190
aVThe language designer actually writes real code in the language, which has tests and therefore shows that the foundation is solid
p191
aVOther people can more easily read, borrow, and even change the higher level function without having to be able to build or even understand the language core
p192
aVJust because a language like Python compiles to bytecode and executes that doesn't mean it is slow
p193
aVThere's no reason why somebody couldn't write a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler for Python, along the lines of what Java and
p194
aVNET already do, to further increase the performance
p195
aVIn fact, IronPython compiles Python directly to
p196
aVNET bytecode, which is then run using the
p197
aVNET system including the JIT
p198
aVTo answer your question directly, the only time a language designer would implement a function in the language behind the runtime (eg
p199
aVC in the case of Python) would be to maximise the performance of that function
p200
aVThis is why modules such as the regular expression parser are written in C rather than native Python
p201
aVOn the other hand, a module like getopt
p202
aVpy is implemented in pure Python because it can all be done there and there's no benefit to using the corresponding C library

VOne of the fundamental differences in filesystem semantics between Unix and Windows is the idea of inodes
p579
aVOn Windows, a file name is directly attached to the file data
p580
aVThis means that the OS prevents somebody from deleting a file that is currently open
p581
aVOn some versions of Windows you can rename a file that is currently open, and on some versions you can't
p582
aVOn Unix, a file name is a pointer to an inode, which is the place the file data is actually stored
p583
aVThis has a couple of implications:
p584
aVYou can have two different filenames that refer to the same underlying file
p585
aVThis is often called a hard link
p586
aVThere is only one copy of the file data, so changes made through one filename will appear in the other
p587
aVYou can delete (also known as ) a file that is currently open
p588
aVAll that happens is the directory entry is removed, but this doesn't affect any other process that might still have the file open
p589
aVThe process with the file open hangs on to the inode, rather than to the directory entry
p590
aVWhen the process closes the file, the OS deletes the inode because there are no more directory entries pointing at it and no more processes with the inode open
p591

aVOne can certainly write cross-platform C code, you just have to be aware of the differences between platforms, and test, test, test

VI really like python, it's usually my language of choice these days for small (non-gui) stuff that I do on my own
p611
aVHowever, for some larger Python projects I've tackled, I'm finding that it's not quite the same as programming in say, C++
p612
aVI was working on a language parser, and needed to represent an AST in Python
p613
aVThis is certainly within the scope of what Python can do, but I had a bit of trouble with some refactoring
p614
aVI was changing the representation of my AST and changing methods and classes around a lot, and I found I missed the strong typing that would be available to me in a C++ solution
p615
aVPython's duck typing was almost too flexible and I found myself adding a lot of  code to try to check my types as the program ran
p616
aVAnd then I couldn't really be sure that everything was properly typed unless I had 100% code coverage testing (which I didn't at the time)
p617
aVActually, that's another thing that I miss sometimes
p618
aVIt's possible to write syntactically correct code in Python that simply won't run
p619
aVThe compiler is incapable of telling you about it until it actually executes the code, so in infrequently-used code paths such as error handlers you can easily have unseen bugs lurking around
p620
aVEven code that's as simple as printing an error message with a % format string can fail at runtime because of mismatched types

p648
aV:)
p649
aV@Linor: That's essentially what you would do after creating a Voronoi diagram
p650
aVBut instead of making a rectangular grid, you can choose dividing lines that closely match the lines of the Voronoi diagram (this way you will get fewer areas that cross dividing lines)
p651
aVIf you recursively divide your Voronoi diagram in half along the best dividing line for each subdiagram, you can then do a tree search for each point you want to look up

p2170
aVThe C++ standard requires that the members are initialised in the order they are declared, regardless of the order you write the initialisers

p2623

p3752
aVAn example of a recursive implementation of a max() function in pseudocode might be:

p3814

VI would consider it the responsibility of the branch maintenance developer to merge the appropriate change into the current state of the trunk
p4065
aVThere are several possibilities:
p4066
aVThe code in the trunk has not changed and the patch applies without conflict
p4067
aVThe code in the trunk has changed and the patch applies, but with a manual merge needed
p4068
aVThe code in the trunk has completely changed and the patch cannot apply
p4069
aVThe developer must evaluate whether the same defect exists in the trunk, and apply an equivalent fix if needed
p4070
aVCases 1 and 2 are the usual maintenance development paths
p4071
aVCase 3 is the case you are considering, where the trunk code cannot accept the maintenance patch in any form
p4072
aVIf the developer cannot himself determine whether the same problem might exist in the trunk, then he should enter an issue into the issue tracking system
p4073
aVThis issue would direct the trunk developers to consider the reason for the patch in the maintenance branch and whether the same defect might still exist
p4074
aVEntering a new issue for a possible defect in the trunk should be a last resort for the maintenance developer
p4075
aVOne benefit of having maintenance developers try to apply patches to the updated trunk is to increase their familiarity with the new code base
p4076

VI see you have declared an empty copy constructor:

aVAs I'm sure you are aware, this function does nothing, and it also leaves  uninitialised
p5498

p5499
aVYou can do this by placing the following declarations in the  section of your class:
p5500
aVThis prevents the compiler from auto-generating incorrect versions of these methods, and also prevents you from calling them in other code you write (because these are only declarations, but not definitions with  code blocks)
p5501
aVAlso, as Arnout mentioned, the constructor that takes a  argument seems wrong

p6200
aVFor example, an experienced programmer can easily knock out a simple arithmetic expression evaluator in a couple of hours, with unit tests
p6201
aVBut a novice programmer may have to learn about parsing techniques, recursive descent, abstract representation of expression trees, tree-walking strategies, and so on

p7204
aVI think your first requirement alone (generating ELF output) might take well over a thousand lines of code by itself

p7336
aVTo answer your concurrent parent question, you will need to have the parent set up a  loop to handle possible responses from any of its children at any time
p7337
aVYou will need to:
p7338
aVkeep track of how many children are open
p7339
aVkeep a set of pipes for each child
p7340
aVuse a loop with  to both accept incoming connections (since they may happen at any time) and also incoming data from any child
p7341
aVuse  to reap children who have terminated
p7342
aVThis technique is powerful but does require a lot of bookkeeping to set up properly
p7343
aVFile handles opened in the parent are by default inherited in child processes
p7344
aVThe problem may be that both the parent and the child have the write end of the pipe still open, so the when the parent reads from the pipe, it will never see the end of it

VThe first question to ask is, how would you change the IP address of your server once
p7472
aVIn general, you will need the cooperation of your ISP, and even then, they will only have a limited size pool of IP addresses to offer you
p7473
aVChanging the IP address of your server while it's up will cause any existing connections to eventually fail (because packets from the remote server won't find their own way back to your server, which just moved)
p7474
aVSo, you would need to set up multiple IP addresses on your server simultaneously, which is possible but again requires the cooperation of your ISP
p7475
aVThere will also be a practical limit of how many IP addresses you can assign to your single computer
p7476
aVThe advantage of something like Tor is that requests might come from anywhere in the world
p7477
aVIP addresses are divided up by country and then allocated to ISPs, so there would be no way for your ISP to give you an IP address in the range assigned to Germany, for example (assuming you're not in Germany to begin with)

VThere's a simple trick for this problem:
p7616
aVFor completeness, zero is not a power of two
p7617
aVIf you want to take into account that edge case, here's how:
p7618
aVExplanation
p7619
aVFirst and foremost the bitwise binary & operator from MSDN definition:
p7620
aVBinary & operators are predefined for the integral types and bool
p7621
aVFor
p7622
aVintegral types, & computes the logical bitwise AND of its operands
p7623
aVFor bool operands, & computes the logical AND of its operands; that
p7624
aVis, the result is true if and only if both its operands are true
p7625
aVNow let's take a look at how this all plays out:
p7626
aVThe function returns boolean (true / false) and accepts one incoming parameter of type unsigned long (x, in this case)
p7627
aVLet us for the sake of simplicity assume that someone has passed the value 4 and called the function like so:
p7628
aVNow we replace each occurrence of x with 4:
p7629
aVWell we already know that 4
p7630
aV= 0 evals to true, so far so good
p7631
aVBut what about:
p7632
aVThis translates to this of course:
p7633
aVBut what exactly is
p7634
aVThe binary representation of 4 is 100 and the binary representation of 3 is 011 (remember the & takes the binary representation of these numbers
p7635
aVSo we have:
p7636
aVImagine these values being stacked up much like elementary addition
p7637
aVThe  operator says that if both values are equal to 1 then the result is 1, otherwise it is 0
p7638
aVSo , , , and
p7639
aVSo we do the math:
p7640
aVThe result is simply 0
p7641
aVSo we go back and look at what our return statement now translates to:
p7642
aVWhich translates now to:
p7643
aVWe all know that  is simply , and this shows that for our example, 4 is a power of 2

aVThis allows you to keep the configuration in the same place (same folder) as the executable, which makes it easier to find (when using the registry, you have to tell the user where to look)
p7883
aVConfiguration files can usually be edited with a regular text editor
p7884
aVHowever, generally you will have to specify what format is to be used and to read and parse the text file, handling syntax errors if needed
p7885
aVThis method allows you to easily run more than one instance of your program, each with its own separate configuration file (if your app looks in its own directory for the config file, for example)
p7886
aVCommand line options
p7887
aVYour program can read its configuration information from the command line, but you still have to store the data somewhere else
p7888
aVThe command line can only support a limited amount of information before it gets unwieldy
p7889
aVEnvironment variables
p7890
aVYour program could read its configuration information from environment variables
p7891
aVThese might be variables that are set by a script that runs your programs (where you have the same problems as command line options, the data must still be stored somewhere else) or might be a globally set environment variable supplied by the system
p7892
aVWindows provides very primitive tools for changing the global environment, less accessible than even

aVShared memory
p7895
aVThis is an advanced technique that requires cooperation with some other program that puts the data into shared memory

VIt sounds like your program is listening on a socket
p7943
aVNormally, when your program exits the OS closes all sockets that might be open (including listening sockets)

p7945
aVYou may notice that if you shut down your program abnormally, then come back some time later it will start up just fine
p7946

VPatches are useful precisely because they affect only a small part of the code
p8323
aVConsider the case of a developer working away on an open source project
p8324
aVSomebody downloads the code one week, and then submits a change to the developer the next week
p8325
aVChances are the developer has already been working on that source file, so other things have already changed
p8326
aVWith a patch file, the developer can apply the patch to the existing source code, and the  program will find where it applies and apply it
p8327
aVIf the contributor sent the whole file without identifying what changed, the developer would have no way of knowing which previous version of the code the submitter had changed
p8328
aVHow would the developer apply the patch to the latest code in that case
p8329
aVIf the developer wants to review the changes submitted by the contributor, then for a small change it is certainly possible that he can say "oh, he just changed that bit of code there" and move on
p8330
aVFor a more complex change, the developer might apply the patch to a temporary copy of the project, and use a visual diff program to show the changes in a way that's easier to browse

VI found a good explanation at Pass-By-Name Parameter Passing
p8387
aVEssentially, the body of a function is interpreted at call time after textually substituting the actual parameters into the function body
p8388
aVIn this sense the evaluation method is similar to that of C preprocessor macros
p8389
aVBy substituting the actual parameters into the function body, the function body can both read and write the given parameters
p8390
aVIn this sense the evaluation method is similar to pass-by-reference
p8391
aVThe difference is that since with pass-by-name the parameter is evaluated inside the function, a parameter such as  depends on the current value of  inside the function, rather than referring to the value at  before the function was called
p8392
aVThe page I linked above has some more examples of where pass-by-name is both useful, and dangerous

p8402
aVWhen using C string manipulation functions, you must ensure that you allocate enough buffer space for the string operation begin performed (the C runtime won't do it for you)
p8403

p11064
aVSince C (I'm including C++ and Objective-C here) is a low-level language that needs to interface with the operating system directly, in portable code there must necessarily be different sections of the code compiled for different operating systems

aVYou can find extensive examples of this sort of thing in a mature, highly portable code base such as zlib

aVAs a simple example, to close a network socket one must do something like this (at some level, this can certainly be wrapped in a function but it has to exist somewhere):
p11067
aVNewer languages that run on VMs do not need the different platform-specific sections of code, and can be written against the single, portable standard library

VAs mentioned by others, the most flexible workflow is one where you don't need to lock
p11417
aVHowever, if you really do want to lock a file, Subversion provides this capability
p11418
aVAdd the property  to the file(s) for which you want to require locking, and set the value to  (I don't think it actually matters what the property value is)
p11419
aVThen when checking out or updating, Subversion will mark those file(s) as read-only in your working copy to remind you to lock them first
p11420
aVYou would lock the file with Subversion (I see you already found this option, but it doesn't do anything for files that don't need locking) which will make the file read-write on disk
p11421
aVThen make your changes
p11422
aVWhen you check in the file, Subversion will automatically release the lock (but there is an option to keep it if you like)
p11423
aVThen the file will be read-only in your working copy again
p11424
aVNote that locking in Subversion is "advisory" only
p11425
aVThis means that anybody else can force acquisition of the lock even though somebody else might already have it
p11426
aVIn this case, the workflow is still supported because somebody may still need to merge their changes as they would without locking
p11427
aVFinally, locking files is the best way to deal with non-text files in Subversion, such as image files or MS Word files

VOne thing that's going wrong here is the following line doesn't do what you expect:
p11887
aVThis calls the  constructor, which is designed to convert a C-style null-terminated string to a C++
p11888
aVThis constructor reads bytes starting at the given pointer and copies them to the new  until it reaches a null byte (\u005cx00)
p11889
aVThis is consistent with the behaviour of C functions such as
p11890
aVSo, when your  is constructed, it consists of a string of length 3, with bytes \u005cxff, \u005cxff, \u005cxff
p11891
aVAccess to indexes greater than 2 are accessing bytes off the end of the array (which will produce a runtime error at best, or undefined behaviour at worst)
p11892
aVNote that a  can hold intermediate null bytes, but you cannot use the above constructor to initialise such a string because the null byte is interpreted as terminating the C-style string passed to the constructor
p11893
aVIt would be worth trying your code again with the \u005cx00 byte changed to something else, just to see how it differs from what you have already described:

aVThe flat array

aVTo access elements on the left or right, subtract or add 1 (take care at the row boundaries)
p12247
aVTo access elements above or below, subtract or add the row size (in this case 3)
p12248
aVThe two dimensional array (for languages such as C or FORTRAN that support this)
p12249
aVAccessing adjacent elements is just incrementing or decrementing either the row or column number
p12250
aVThe compiler is still doing exactly the same arithmetic as in the flat array
p12251
aVThe array of arrays (eg
p12252
aVJava)
p12253
aVIn this method, a list of "row pointers" (represented on the left) each is a new, independent array
p12254
aVLike the 2-d array, adjacent elements are accessed by adjusting the appropriate index
p12255
aVFully linked cells (2-d doubly linked list)
p12256
aVThis method has each cell containing up to four pointers to its adjacent elements
p12257
aVAccess to adjacent elements is through the appropriate pointer
p12258
aVYou will need to still keep a structure of pointers to elements (probably using one of the above methods) to avoid having to step through each linked list sequentially
p12259

aVIt depends on the situation

aVIn a console mode program, it might be perfectly appropriate to sleep the thread if you're waiting for something
p12922
aVPerhaps even in a loop: Check the condition, sleep for a bit if it's not satisfied, repeat
p12923
aVIn a graphical program however, normally you would not sleep on the main (GUI) thread
p12924
aVThis is because these days GUI interfaces are designed with a single interactive thread
p12925
aVIf you sleep on that thread, your whole GUI will appear to "lock up" for the time that you're sleeping
p12926
aVA better situation might be to use some kind of timer (all GUI frameworks have such a concept)
p12927
aVOne thing you do not want to do is write a loop that continually checks for some condition to be true, without even sleeping

aVThis will cause one CPU to run up to 100% because the CPU wants to get its work done as fast as possible

aVA typical modern computer might have a 32-bit data bus
p13689
aVThis means that any fetch that the CPU needs to do will fetch all 32 bits of a particular memory address
p13690
aVSince the data bus can't fetch anything smaller than 32 bits, the lowest two address bits aren't even used on the address bus, so it's as if RAM is organised into a sequence of 32-bit words instead of 8-bit bytes
p13691
aVWhen the CPU does a fetch for a single byte, the read cycle on the bus will fetch 32 bits and then the CPU will discard 24 of those bits, loading the remaining 8 bits into whatever register
p13692
aVIf the CPU wants to fetch a 32 bit value that is not aligned on a 32-bit boundary, it has several general choices:
p13693
aVexecute two separate read cycles on the bus to load the appropriate parts of the data word and reassemble them
p13694

aVAn "application" in Mac OS X is simply a directory with a certain structure inside it, named with a  extension

aVInstalling an application is as simple as dragging it (just the app icon) to your Applications folder, and uninstalling involves dragging it to the trash

aVThat's it, no fancy installer is (usually) necessary
p14198
aVOn Windows, application are typically built from independent components which need to be "registered"
p14199
aVThis involves the installer program writing some bits and pieces to the Windows registry, to tell Windows where to find the components
p14200
aVYes, the application probably should know where to find them (since they're all installed in the same place), but years of legacy and different ways of hooking up components has got us where we are today

VSince  is a constant expression, your compiler is likely to evaluate the answer at compile time, instead of generating code to calculate the same result at runtime
p14621
aVThe answer happens to be 8, so the statement would be the same as:
p14622
aVIn this case the compiler is likely to generate what's called an immediate push onto the argument stack, where the value 8 is embedded right into the machine instruction(s)
p14623
aVThis might be different than pushing a larger value such as 12345678, where it might be too big for an immediate push and then might need to be stored in program memory

p14633

VPython is a strongly, dynamically typed language
p14642
aVWhat this means is:
p14643
aVObjects are strongly typed which means an integer is an integer and can't be treated as anything else unless you say so
p14644
aVObjects have a specific type and stay that way
p14645
aVYou can use a name (a variable) to refer to an object, but the name doesn't have any particular type
p14646
aVIt all depends on what the name refers to, and this can change as other things are assigned to the same name
p14647
aVPython strongly makes use of the so-called "duck typing" technique where objects do not have (and do not need) specifically typed interfaces
p14648
aVIf an object supports a certain set of methods (the canonical example is a file-like object), then it can be used in a context that expects file-like objects

p14664

p14665
aVPostgreSQL) would be able to handle it well
p14666

aVGiven a choice between FAT32 and NTFS, then definitely choose NTFS
p14669
aVDon't store too many files in a single directory, 100,000 might be an upper limit to consider (although you will have to experiment, there's no hard and fast rule)
p14670
aVYour friend's suggestion of a new directory for every letter is probably too much, you might consider breaking it up on every four letters or something
p14671
aVThe best value to choose depends on the shape of your dataset
p14672
aVThe reason breaking up the name is a good idea is that typically the performance of filesystems decreases as the number of files in a directory increases
p14673
aVThis depends highly on the filesystem in use, for example FAT32 will be horrible with probably only a few thousand files per directory

aVOne thing you can do with the index is roughly the same as Subversion's "changelist" support, except it's more convenient

aVI often stage just one or two files out of several possibly modified ones, to construct a single commit containing just those files

p16439
aVPlease note that there are clearly many different kinds of "handles", as it is a generic concept widely used within the computing environment
p16440
aVCertainly you will be familiar with the concept of a file handle; Windows also offers window handles and many other kinds of handles
p16441
aVHaving said that:
p16442
aVA "memory handle" (that is similar to a pointer to a struct) is a concept from the land of 16-bit Windows programming, where there was no memory manager in the CPU and all memory management had to be done in software
p16443
aVEssentially, a "handle" was sort of a pointer, but the OS would be free to move around the memory that the handle referred to
p16444
aVYou can't do that with a regular pointer, but the handle had functions that would get and release the actual memory address
p16445
aVWith the introduction of Win32, where the CPU had a hardware memory manager, the concept of the memory handle became obsolete

VI think it's pretty clear that your program has a bug
p16551
aVIf you don't know where to start looking, a useful technique is "divide and conquer"
p16552
aVStart with your program in a state where you can cause the exception to happen
p16553
aVEliminate half your code, and try again
p16554
aVIf the exception still happens, then you've got half as much code to look through
p16555
aVIf the exception doesn't happen, then it might have been related to the code you just removed
p16556
aVRepeat the above until you isolate the problem
p16557
aVUpdate: You say "at that stage the program isn't doing anything" but clearly it is doing something (otherwise it wouldn't crash)
p16558
aVIs your program a console mode program
p16559
aVIf so, what function are you using to wait for user input
p16560
aVIf not, then is it a GUI mode program
p16561
aVHave you opened a dialog box and are waiting for something to happen
p16562
aVHave you got any Windows timers running
p16563
aVAny threads
p16564
aVUpdate 2: In light of the small snippet of code you posted, I'm pretty sure that if you try to remove the call to the  function, then your problem is likely to go away
p16565
aVYou will have to investigate what the requirements are for "miniFMOD

aVdll"
p16567
aVFor example, that DLL might assume that it's running in a GUI environment instead of a console program, and may do things that don't necessarily work in console mode
p16568
aVAlso, in order to do anything in the background (including playing a song), that DLL probably needs to create a thread to periodically load the next bit of the song and queue it in the play buffer
p16569
aVYou can check the number of threads being created by your program in Task Manager (or better, Process Explorer)

aVFor example, if you often access pairs of bits, then you may see some improvement by providing a method to get two bits instead of one, even if you don't always end up using both bits
p17806
aVAs with any optimisation problem, you will need to be very familiar with the behaviour of your code, in particular its access patterns in your bit array, to make a meaningful improvement in performance
p17807
aVUpdate: Since you access ranges of bits, you can probably squeeze some more performance out of your macros
p17808
aVFor example, if you need to access four bits you might have macros like this:
p17809
aVThese macros would clip out four bits from each bit position 0, 1, 2, etc

p19473
aVIf developers are each using an individual branch, then you're just delaying possible integration problems until later, when you merge the branches
p19474
aVOf course, having developers work on the same branch means you need to have actual communication between those developers, but that's a social problem and not a technical one
p19475
aVDevelopers would work on separate branches when there is a good reason for that branch to exist in the first place (such as a patch release of a previous version of the software, or a special build for a specific customer)

p20322

p25164
aVWhen you open a file for writing (with the  open mode in Python), the OS removes the original file and creates a totally new one

p25167
aVAfter you swap the order of opening so you open for writing and then reading, you won't necessarily be able to read the data from the file until you flush it:
p25168
aVFlushing the file writes any data that might be in Python's file buffers to the OS, so that when you read from the file from the other handle, the OS will return the data

aVPsil is a new general-purpose programming language in the Lisp family of languages
p25446
aVPsil is implemented on top of Python, allowing easy access to existing Python libraries
p25447
aVBest features from Lisp and Scheme

p25449
aVBuilt upon the Python standard libraries
p25450
aVStrong interoperability with Python code
p25451
aVThe reality hasn't quite caught up to the vision; for example I don't think there is a way to declare new classes in Psil code that can be used from Python
p25452
aVBut at least for functions, it's mostly there

aV7 of Stroustrup's Design and Evolution of C++ describes the introduction of references into the language
p25814
aVIf you're interested in the rationale behind any feature of C++, I highly recommend this book
p25815
aVReferences were introduced primarily to support operator overloading
p25816
aVDoug McIlroy recalls that once I was explaining some problems with a precursor to the current operator overloading scheme to him
p25817
aVHe used the word reference with the startling effect that I muttered "Thank you," and left his office to reappear the next day with the current scheme essentially complete
p25818
aVDoug had reminded me of Algol68
p25819
aVC passes every function argument by value, and where passing an object by value would be inefficient or inappropriate the user can pass a pointer
p25820
aVThis strategy doesn't work where operator overloading is used
p25821
aVIn that case, notational convenience is essential because users cannot be expected to insert address-of operators if the objects are large
p25822
aVFor example:
p25823
aVis acceptable (that is, conventional) notation, but
p25824
aVis not
p25825
aVAnyway,  already has a meaning in C, and I didn't want to change that
p25826
aVIt is not possible to change what a reference refers to after initialization
p25827
aVThat is, once a C++ reference is initialized, it cannot be re-bound
p25828
aVI had in the past been bitten by Algol68 references where  can either assign through  to the object referred to or assign a new reference value to  (re-binding ) depending on the type of

aVThis sequence might be elements of an existing list, or it might be something calculated, like prime numbers or the decimal digits of \u03c0

VThe only information that Git stores from one revision to the next is the state (the names and contents) of the files at each revision
p27920
aVIn revision A, this file had this content, and in revision B, this file had that other content
p27921
aVGit doesn't care how the files got from point A to point B, whether it was an edit, or a rename, or a conflict resolution, or an octopus merge
p27922
aVThis approach has the benefit of a conceptually simple repository format
p27923
aVThis is important because your repository is your history, and history should be preserved in the simplest format possible
p27924
aVOne implication of this is that whenever Git needs to figure out what happened between revision A and B (for example), it needs to work out the details at the time you ask for it
p27925
aVEven for a simple diff, while some tools might be able to simply show the internally stored diff, Git compares the files in revision A and B and regenerates the diff when requested
p27926
aVFor renames, Git notices that a new file just appeared, and looks for similar files in a previous revision to guess whether the file was renamed or not
p27927
aVAs the Git tools improve over time, more of how the history was formed can be reported, without it having to have been recorded at the time
p27928
aVFor example, it is often claimed that Git can "track individual bits of code moving from one file to another"

aVThere is indeed a less awkward workaround:

aVWhen the developer finally commits, there is going to be a lot of changes all rolled up into one commit
p29461
aVFor the other developers who want to merge their work with this "big bang" commit, the VCS tool isn't going to have enough information about how the first developer got to the point they committed, so you just get "here's a giant conflict in this whole function, go fix it"
p29462
aVOn the other hand, the usual style of working with Git and other DVCS that have cheap local branches, is to commit regularly
p29463
aVOnce you've done one bit of work that pretty much makes sense, you commit it
p29464
aVIt doesn't have to be perfect but it should be a coherent unit of work

aVWhen you come back to merge, you still have that history of smaller commits that shows how you got from the original state to the current state
p29466
aVWhen the DVCS goes to merge this with the work of others, it has a lot more information about what changes were made when, and you end up getting smaller and fewer conflicts

p29921
aVThis is where the heuristic comes in
p29922
aVIf most of the lines are the same, then Git will show it as a rename, but if there are enough changed lines compared to unchanged lines, then Git will simply say it looks like a new file

V[This answer attempts to summarise the discussion in the comments above
p30015
aVModern DVCS (eg
p30016
aVGit, Mercurial) manage changes as sequences of commits, rather than sets of files
p30017
aVBecause if this different paradigm, it is difficult to think of a "label" that selects particular files from particular revisions
p30018
aVCommits may touch several files, and commits can both touch a given file (though the change inside the file may or may not overlap)
p30019
aVTo manage a staged release using Git, what you could do is:
p30020
aVGrab the previous release branch
p30021
aVPull each branch or cherry-pick each commit that is intended to be in the next staging test (you can do this on a development workstation)
p30022
aVPush to staging repository
p30023
aVPull that into the staging server
p30024
aVWhen the staging checks out okay, pull that same branch into production
p30025
aVIn the (hopefully) common case where there aren't any changes you don't want, then step 2 becomes a single-step merge
p30026
aVIf you don't want a particular change, then you can cherry-pick the changes you do want

p30265
aVThen choose the elements from your set based on which bits are set to 1

aVIn your case, you would use pass  as 2N if  is the number of elements in your set

aVThere's no index, no way to look up specific files inside the dump file, and (there are a few different dump file formats) I think deltas are often stored in the dump file

VThe difference between the scalar type  and the boxed type  is surprising to someone new to Java
p31946
aVJava has always made a distinction between the "scalar" types, which are not classes:  (true/false),  (unsigned 16-bit),  (signed 16-bit),  (signed 32-bit), and  (signed 64-bit); and everything else which is a class and ultimately derived from the  class
p31947
aVThe problem comes when you want to use something like a generic collection like a
p31948
aVA  can contain anything that is derived from , but not scalar values
p31949
aVSo in order to store  values into a , you need to wrap them into an instance of a class called  that is derived from
p31950
aVIn old versions of Java, you also needed to explicitly get the value out of the  class using a  method call
p31951
aVIn newer versions of Java, this conversion is called "unboxing" and is automatic in some situations

aVYour Python interpreter may be installed elsewhere

p32205
aVType  if you don't know where it is installed

aVHope it helps
p33819
aVIf you have made changes to files on branch A and want to switch to branch B (which is unrelated), then it\u2019s a good idea to commit the changes to branch A first
p33820
aVThis way, the changes will still be on branch A when you come back to it later

aVIf you don\u2019t commit the changes first, then there are two situations that can arise
p33826
aVConsider a file \u201cfile

p33828
aVThe two situations are:
p33829
aVThe latest version of file
p33830
aVtxt on branch A and branch B is identical
p33831
aVIn this case, a \u201cgit checkout B\u201d will carry over the changes to file
p33832
aVtxt to your working directory after successfully switching to branch B
p33833
aVThis can be useful for things like changes to platform configuration files
p33834
aVGit will list the files carried over in this way in the output of the \u201cgit checkout\u201d command
p33835
aVThe latest versions of file
p33836
aVtxt on branch A and branch B are different
p33837
aVWhen you ask to switch branches to branch B, git will refuse to switch branches because doing so would overwrite your changes to file
p33838

p33839
aVYou\u2019ll get a message from git saying that you must commit (or stash) the conflicting file(s) first
p33840
aVIf you have more than one changed file, then any file in situation (2) will prevent a branch switch
p33841
aVFinally, if you want to discard modifications to a file, use a command like \u201cgit checkout -- file

aVThe next time you call  you will get the same value
p33888
aVBy calling  inside the child process, you are potentially helping but the granularity of  is only 1 second, so all your children probably start inside the same second

p35844
aVDoes C++ maintain some sort of object state outside of the area of memory that object was instantiated in
p35845
aVThe answer is no
p35846
aVThere are no other data structures set up to "track" objects or anything of the sort
p35847
aVC++ uses an explicit memory allocation model, so if you choose to be responsible for allocation and deallocation, then you have complete control
p35848

VIn broad terms
p36350
aVthe compiler generates code in "object records" that contains a bunch of assembly code and supporting information
p36351
aVThe linker links these object records together to create an executable
p36352
aVOften a compiler will create a single object record for an entire source file
p36353
aVIn this case, the linker can only decide to link in the entire object record, or not
p36354
aVSince there is at least one function in the object record that is used, it must link in all of it
p36355
aVOn some compilers, you can tell it to generate a separate object record for each function (an object file can have multiple object records)
p36356
aVIn this case, the linker can make the decision to omit some of the object records if they're never called
p36357
aVFrom the Microsoft documentation for /OPT:
p36358
aV/OPT:REF
p36359
aVLINK removes unreferenced packaged functions by default
p36360
aVAn object contains packaged functions (COMDATs) if it has been compiled with the /Gy option
p36361
aVThis optimization is called transitive COMDAT elimination
p36362
aVTo override this default and keep unreferenced COMDATs in the program, specify /OPT:NOREF
p36363
aVYou can use the /INCLUDE option to override the removal of a specific symbol
p36364
aVThe  compiler option enables function-level linking
p36365
aVFor reference, this feature also exists in gcc:
p36366
aV-ffunction-sections
p36367
aV-fdata-sections
p36368
aVPlace each function or data item into its own section in the output file if the target supports arbitrary sections
p36369
aVThe name of the function or the name of the data item determines the section\u2019s name in the output file
p36370
aVUse these options on systems where the linker can perform optimizations to improve locality of reference in the instruction space
p36371
aVMost systems using the ELF object format and SPARC processors running Solaris 2 have linkers with such optimizations
p36372
aVAIX may have these optimizations in the future
p36373
aVOnly use these options when there are significant benefits from doing so
p36374
aVWhen you specify these options, the assembler and linker will create larger object and executable files and will also be slower
p36375
aVYou will not be able to use "gprof" on all systems if you specify this option and you may have problems with debugging if you specify both this option and -g
p36376
aVAnd the companion option in ld:
p36377
aV--gc-sections

p36380

p38445

p38447
aVUPDATE: Here is Google developer support response to this:
p38448
aVThank you for your note
p38449
aVCurrently the maximum file size limit for an app upload to Google Play is approximately 50 MB
p38450
aVHowever, some devices may have smaller than 50 MB cache partition making the app unavailable for users to download
p38451
aVFor example, some of HTC Wildfire devices are known for having 35-40 MB cache partitions
p38452
aVIf Google Play is able to identify such device that doesn't have cache large enough to store the app, it may filter it from appearing for the user

p40593
aVHowever, most patch programs have heuristic algorithms which allow the base file to be different in certain ways from the base file originally used to create the patch

aVSwapping" is likely a reference to OS paging behaviour, where pages are swapped out to disk when the memory pressure becomes high
p40645
aVIn practice, if your inline functions are small then you will usually notice a performance improvement due to eliminating the overhead of a function call and return
p40646
aVHowever, in very rare circumstances, you may cause code to grow such that it cannot completely reside inside the CPU cache (during a performance-critical tight loop), and you may experience decreased performance

aVYou can always look at the generated assembly code to find out what it did

p41110
aVNote that depending on the dynamic properties of your program, you may need to be careful about writer starvation
p41111
aVIf there are enough readers that their attempts to read always overlap (or overlap for a long time), then a simple implementation of a reader-writer lock will "starve" the writer by making the writer wait until there are no readers reading
p41112
aVIn a more advanced implementation, a writer request will be conceptually inserted into the queue before subsequent readers, allowing the writer to have a chance to access after all the previously active readers finish
p41113
aVMost implementations require you to know ahead of time whether you want a read lock or a write lock

VIn support of Stallman's position, Python does not do the same thing as typical Lisp systems in the following areas:
p41149
aVThe  function in Lisp reads an S-expression, which represents an arbitrary data structure that can either be treated as data, or evaluated as code
p41150
aVThe closest thing in Python reads a single string, which you would have to parse yourself if you want it to mean anything
p41151
aVThe  function in Lisp can execute any Lisp code
p41152
aVThe  function in Python evaluates only expressions, and needs the  statement to run statements
p41153
aVBut both these work with Python source code represented as text, and you have to jump through a bunch of hoops to "eval" a Python AST
p41154
aVThe  function in Lisp writes out an S-expression in exactly the same form that  accepts
p41155
aVin Python prints out something defined by the data you're trying to print, which is certainly not always reversible
p41156
aVStallman's statement is a bit disingenuous, because clearly Python does have functions named exactly  and , but they do something different (and inferior) to what he expects
p41157
aVIn my opinion, Python does have some aspects similar to Lisp, and I can understand why people might have recommended that Stallman look into Python

p41440
aVThose keys are used to modify what actually does get returned, once the user presses a non-modifier key
p41441
aVTo get the actual keystrokes pressed, you will probably need to write an ISR for IRQ 9 (I'm pretty sure that is the number for the keyboard hardware interrupt)
p41442
aVAt that point you can get the raw "make" and "break" scan codes for every key on the keyboard, and take whatever action you want

aVWhen declaring an external DLL function in C++, there is no (standard) way to indicate which named DLL the function can actually be found in
p41840
aVAs far as the compiler is concerned, the declared function is simply  and there must be a definition that can be found somewhere by the linker
p41841
aVTo connect the named function to the DLL in which it can be found, the C++ toolchain requires an "import library" that contains import stubs that the linker knows what to do with

aVWhen finding a function defined by an import stub, the linker creates a DLL function reference for the specific function name in the corresponding DLL (as indicated by the import stub)

p41908
aVThe rule is encoded in two columns, each of nine eaters, where one column corresponds to the 'Birth' rule and the other corresponds to 'Survival'
p41909
aVThe nine eaters correspond to the nine different quantities of on cells (0 through 8)
p41910
aVThe presence or absence of the eater indicates whether the cell should be on in the next meta-generation
p41911
aVThe state of the eater is read by the collision of two antiparallel LWSSes, which radiates two antiparallel gliders (not unlike an electron-positron reaction in a PET scanner)
p41912
aVThese gliders then collide into beehives, which are restored by a passing LWSS in Brice's elegant honeybit reaction
p41913
aVIf the eater is present, the beehive would remain in its original state, thereby allowing the LWSS to pass unaffected; if the eater is absent, the beehive would be restored, consuming the LWSS in the process

p43655
aVWhen you ask for a difference between two versions, Git retrieves both complete files from the repository1, and runs the diff algorithm between them

aVBecause of the way files are stored in the Git repository, it is not possible to tell Git to somehow keep track of a custom diff alignment

p44356
aVThe general idea is to create an intermediate process between the parent and the child, that has one purpose: Notice when the parent dies, and explicitly kill the child
p44357
aVThis type of solution is useful when the code in the child can't be modified

aVThere are two small caveats with this method:
p44359
aVIf you deliberately kill the intermediate process, then the child won't be killed when the parent dies
p44360
aVIf the child exits before the parent, then the intermediate process will try to kill the original child pid, which could now refer to a different process

aVYes, operating systems are specifically designed to do this
p45132
aVIn general, two programs of equal priority who each want to use all CPU cores will share the cores 50%-50% (by time, not by core allocation)
p45133
aVEach application will believe that it is using all cores, but some cores might appear to run a bit slower than others

aVIn your first example,  is converting a string to an integer

aVWhen you give it , that is not an integer so it fails

aVThere is also the  value, which can be used with any of the above:
p46923
aVThe key point to remember is that the  value represents the first value that is not in the selected slice
p46924
aVSo, the difference beween  and  is the number of elements selected (if  is 1, the default)
p46925
aVThe other feature is that  or  may be a negative number, which means it counts from the end of the array instead of the beginning
p46926
aVSo:
p46927
aVPython is kind to the programmer if there are fewer items than you ask for
p46928
aVFor example, if you ask for  and  only contains one element, you get an empty list instead of an error
p46929
aVSometimes you would prefer the error, so you have to be aware that this may happen
