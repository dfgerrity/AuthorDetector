VI would say that agile, unless you are talking about a specific methodology like Scrum or XP, is really more of a mindset coupled with the practices that make the actions that flow out of that mindset practical for developing software
p12
aVWhile you can't probably do straight Scrum or XP in a highly (or even moderately) multiproject environment, you can apply practices common to agile methodologies and "roll your own" agile methology, so to speak
p13
aVThis is, in fact, how I work
p14

p15

VI really don't think that what you want reflects the structure better
p39
aVTo define a schema (think XSD) for this you would have to know all of the potential keys in advance since you indicate that you want each one to be a separate custom type
p40
aVConceptually Bars would be an array of objects holding objects of type Key0, Key1, with each of the KeyN class containing a value property
p41
aVI believe that the first serialization actually is the best reflection of the underlying structure
p42

VTests allow you to refactor with confidence that you are not breaking the system
p78
aVWriting the tests first allows the tests to define what is working behavior for the system
p79
aVAny behavior that isn't defined by the test is by definition a by-product and allowed to change when refactoring
p80
aVWriting tests first also drive the design in good directions
p81
aVTo support testability you find that you need to decouple classes, use interfaces, and follow good pattern (Inversion of Control, for instance) to make your code easily testable
p82
aVIf you write tests afterwards, you can't be sure that you've covered all the behavior expected of your system in the tests
p83

VBeyond just the technical details, I think using virtual/override communicates a lot of semantic information on the design
p104
aVWhen you declare a method virtual, you indicate that you expect that implementing classes may want to provide their own, non-default implementations
p105
aVOmitting this in a base class, likewise, declares the expectation that the default method ought to suffice for all implementing classes
p106
aVSimilarly, one can use abstract declarations to force implementing classes to provide their own implementation
p107
aVAgain, I think this communicates a lot about how the programmer expects the code to be used

VI would set up a view and an associated table-based function based on the CTE

p836
aVYou can then associate the function with the Table entity and invoke the method created on the DataContext to derive objects of the type defined by the view
p837
aVUsing the table-based function allows the query engine to take your parameters into account while constructing the result set rather than applying a condition on the result set defined by the view after the fact

p851
aVWith dependency injection (constructor injection) we do:
p852
aVThis allows the CvsReader to be more easily testable
p853
aVWe pass an instance implementing the interface we depend on in the constructor, in this case IStream
p854
aVBecause of this we can create another class (perhaps a mock class) that implements IStream, but doesn't necessarily do file I/O
p855
aVWe can use this class to feed to our reader whatever data we want without involving any of the underlying framework
p856
aVIn this case, I'd use a MemoryStream since we just reading from it
p857
aVIn we wanted to, though, we could use a mock class and give it a richer interface that lets our tests configure the responses that it gives
p858
aVThis way we can test the code that we write and not involve the underlying framework code at all
p859
aVAlternatively we could also pass a TextReader, but the normal dependency injection pattern uses interfaces and I wanted to show the pattern with interfaces

aVIf there are no tests I write tests to make sure that I'm not breaking anything with my refactoring
p919
aVIf there are tests, I use those
p920
aVIf the tests are insufficient, I might write more tests but I would consider this separate from the refactoring and do it first
p921
aVThe first step for me is to notice that I can abstract something and make it more general (and useful in other places that need the functionality now), or I notice that something is bad and could be better (subjective)

aVDevelopers have access to shares where they can publish their application, usually coordinated with the web admin for any setup/configuration
p1109
aVSome senior developers are given administrator access to databases in order to create/modify schemas
p1110
aVUsually, what happens is you develop using a locally installed database server, upload code to QA servers that have a little looser access policy, but are only accessible from company networks, then have the DBAs copy the database schema and roles to production and publish your app to the production web server

p1320
aVI would avoid using user-supplied input due to the chances for incorrect input

aVIf you have a more hierarchical structure where cities are in counties, which are in states, then a table-based approach may be more appropriate since you could have cities with the same name in multiple locations

aVNormally, the models of your data that your application works on would be kept in a business layer, along with the code to operate on them

p1372
aVI think this might be the source of the confusion between the suggested locations of your classes and your reaction to it based on your comments

p1374

VLocality of reference
p1452
aVBecause the data is stored by rows, for each row the j columns are in adjacent memory addresses
p1453
aVThe OS will typically load an entire page from memory into the cache and adjacent address references will likely refer to that same page
p1454
aVIf you increment by the row index in the inner loop it is possible that these rows will be on different pages (since they are separated by j doubles each) and the cache may have to constantly bring in and throw away pages of memory as it references the data
p1455
aVThis is called thrashing and is bad for performance
p1456
aVIn practice and with larger, modern caches, the sizes of the rows/columns would need to be reasonably large before this would come into play, but it's still good practice

VI'd do a couple of things
p1720
aVOne, I'd figure out a way to pass the value that needs to be passed back to the client-side onclick handler
p1721
aVDepending on how you are populating your CheckBoxList, this might be as simple as adding an "onclick" attribute to the ListItem for that checkbox that calls your function with the same value assigned to the label, say 'OnCheckBoxClicked(this,'Label')
p1722
aVThat would eliminate the need to derive the label, although you could probably do this on the client side as well pretty easily by referencing the previous element of the checkbox if you just passed a reference to it (or parent, maybe, depends on whether the label precedes the input or the input is contained in it)
p1723
aVTwo, I would also change it so that it only passes back the current item that is being clicked and handle them one at a time
p1724

VWith respect to (1), views don't invoke other views

aVThey invoke controller actions that may result in other views being rendered

aVIn your case, the primary application window contains a user interface element (button, link) that invokes a controller action to display the preferences window

VI couldn't find any references quickly, but it would seem to me that the entropy is derived from the kernel data structures for the devices, not the actual devices themselves
p1877
aVSince these would be independent regardless of virtualization, I suspect the answer is not much
p1878
aV[EDIT] After peeking at the kernel source (actually patch history), it looks like Linux, at least, gathers entropy from keyboard presses, mouse activity, interrupt timing (but not all interrupts), and block device request finishing times
p1879
aVOn a virtualized system, I suspect that mouse/keyboard events would be pretty low and thus not contribute to the entropy gathered
p1880

VMost of the SSO stuff that I have worked with uses a centralized authentication server (CAS) and operates with tickets passed via query parameters and cookies
p2286
aVThe basic idea is that if your site doesn't detect a ticket, it redirects to your CAS web site
p2287
aVThe web site performs the authentication, sets an authentication cookie, and redirects back to your site with a unique, one-time-use ticket (as query parameter)
p2288
aVWhen redirected, your site detects the ticket and does a callback to the CAS server to redeem the ticket using an out-of-band web request
p2289
aVThis request returns the id of the user who has logged in
p2290
aVYou use this to set the authenticated user in your application
p2291
aVThe CAS server keeps track of which applications are allowed SSO with each other
p2292
aVWhen an authentication request comes in from a site in the SSO pool and the authentication ticket corresponds to another site in the pool, the CAD server responds with a ticket without forcing reauthentication
p2293
aVThis way your sites can just link to one another without any special "magic", just depending on the fact that the CAS cookie will make it so the user can bypass reauthentication between related sites

VUnit tests are there so that your units (methods) do what you expect
p2351
aVWriting the test first forces you to think about what you expect before you write the code
p2352
aVThinking before doing is always a good idea
p2353
aVUnit tests should reflect the business rules
p2354
aVGranted, there can be errors in the code, but writing the test first allows you to write it from the perspective of the business rule before any code has been written
p2355
aVWriting the test afterwards, I think, is more likely to lead to the error you describe because you know how the code implements it and are tempted just to make sure that the implementation is correct -- not that the intent is correct
p2356
aVAlso, unit tests are only one form -- and the lowest, at that -- of tests that you should be writing
p2357
aVIntegration tests and acceptance tests should also be written, the latter by the customer, if possible, to make sure that the system operates the way it is expected

aVFor example, I may write a test for some given functionality, then go develop the code that satisfies that functionality, but in doing so actually write code that does more than it is supposed to -- say it might catch an exception in an alternate case that the test doesn't exercise
p2529
aVWhen I use the coverage analyzer, I can see that I've introduced code that doesn't have an associated test
p2530
aVIt helps me to know when I haven't written enough tests
p2531
aVOn the other hand, coverage analysis can lead to false security
p2532
aVHaving all of your code covered does not mean that you have enough tests
p2533
aVYou need to think about tests from the perspective of what should the code do and write tests to make sure that it does it
p2534
aVPreferably by writing the test first
p2535
aVJust because your code is completely covered does not mean that the code does what it is supposed to do
p2536
aVIn your example, I would have written the test for hashCode to define what the functionality of the method does, before I wrote the code
p2537
aVTherefore, I would have it covered
p2538
aVThat doesn't mean that I always have 100% coverage
p2539
aVI'm not overly zealous about writing tests for simple accessors, for example
p2540
aVI also may not test methods from the parent class where I inherit from a framework, since I don't feel the need to test other people's code

VIf you are trying to defeat brute force attacks you are better off enforcing some failed attempts window/count rather than relying on the speed of the hashing (or hash comparison) mechanism to make the attack take longer to succeed
p2547
aVLock out the account after a certain number of failed attempts within the failure window and only let new attempts be made after a significant amount of time has elapsed
p2548
aVThis could leave you open to a DOS attack against a well-known (administrative) account, but you could exempt certain accounts from the lockout policy or have an alternate way -- using a security question/answer -- to logon to a locked out account before the reset period has elapsed
p2549
aV[EDIT] To help defeat rainbow attacks -- where the attacker has retrieved your hashed passwords and finds suitable matches that hash to the same values -- consider both using a random salt unique to each user's hashed password and a fixed salt that is part of the algorithm, not the data
p2550
aVFor example:
p2551
aVThis should invalidate the rainbow tables since, even knowing the user's salt and the hash algorithm, the values in the attacker's rainbow tables won't map onto your hashed passwords because of the addition of the fixed salt in the algorithm
p2552
aVWith ASP Classic, you'd have to do this in a library instead of on the page to make sure that the user couldn't see your fixed salt

VThe basic difference, as I see it, is that most Spiral models of development still insist on big, up-front design
p2559
aVThe emphasis is on knowing as much as you can about how the system will be used; discovering all the use cases
p2560
aVOnce you know these, then you design the system and break it down into phases that follow an iterative detail-design, implementation, test, refactor-design loop
p2561
aVIn Agile, their is some up-front planning -- perhaps gathering large grain understanding (story titles) -- so that reasonable releases can be described, but each release is planned independently and we delay discovery of the details until we are ready to begin implementation of that release
p2562
aVWe expect change and don't try to know everything first
p2563
aVAnother thing that differs is that most Agile philosophies involve "test-first" methods
p2564
aVThis is different from spiral where testing is often an activity unto itself and tests are not developed prior to code
p2565
aVMost often they are planned in advance, but developed in parallel or after coding

aVI agree that with TDD one ought to use the debugger less rather than more, since you'll be developing the code in small increments

VIf you absolutely have to have your StoreBasketService use the session, I'd be tempted to define an interface and wrapper around HttpSessionState instead of using HttpSessionStateBase so that you can register it with StructureMap as well

aVThe wrapper would get the session state from the current context
p2672
aVRegister the wrapper with StructureMap and then have your StoreBasketService take the interface as the argument to the constructor
p2673
aVStructure map should then know how to create an instance of the interface wrapper and inject it into your StoreBasketService class
p2674
aVUsing an interface and wrapper will allow you to mock the wrapper in your unit tests, muc in the same way HttpSessionStateBase allows mocking the actual session
p2675
aVHowever, you can have StructureMap actually store your basket in the session using  when registering it
p2676
aVIt may actually be better to have your StoreBasketService implement internal storage instead of storing things in the session -- then you lose the dependency on the session state entirely (from the perspective of your class) and your solution could be simpler

VAfter doing a bit of digging around and considering the answers provided so far I've come up with an alternative that lets me continue to use InProc session
p2733
aVBasically, it consists of extending the HttpModule that already handles single sign-on to detected CAS sign outs and redirect the browser to the application sign out page
p2734
aVOutline:
p2735
aVSign-On:
p2736
aVFor each new single sign-on request, create a new SSO cookie and encode a unique value in it to identify the session (not the session id, so it isn't leaked)
p2737
aVConstruct the the sign-out callback url, encoded with the identifier, and register it with the CAS server
p2738
aVSign-Out:
p2739
aVWhen a sign-out request is received from the CAS server, decode the identifier and store it in an application-wide cache
p2740
aVThis needs to be pinned in the cache at least long enough for the session to expire naturally
p2741
aVFor each request, look for the SSO cookie and check its value against the cached, signed-out session identifiers
p2742
aVIf there is a hit, remove the SSO cookie and redirect the browser to the application's sign-out url
p2743
aVFor each sign-out, check to see if there is an SSO cookie, if so, forward the sign-out request to the CAS
p2744
aVIn any event, abandon the user's session, and sign them out of the application

VI can see your point, but I think I would describe HTML-CSS-Server/Browser more as Document-Viewer rather than MVC
p2970
aVIf all of the content is static then it is an expression of the model, true, but the model is embedded in mark up
p2971
aVEven though I can override it with CSS, CSS is really just a filter on the underlying presentation described in HTML
p2972
aVThe HTML describes a view of the data as well as the data itself
p2973
aVTo wit, I can turn off CSS and I still have a view of the data
p2974
aVIn MVC, this is not possible
p2975
aVThere is also a close coupling between your HTML and your CSS -- both need to be very aware of the other
p2976
aVThis violates a key paradigm of MVC where the components are loosely coupled
p2977
aVIn particular the view enforces no constraints on the model (other than the restriction that the data be viewable)
p2978
aVHTML designers are constrained to operate within the domain of the CSS or to modify the CSS to make it applicable to the domain of the HTML
p2979
aVFurther, HTML has no way of operating on the data to make persistent changes
p2980
aVA key aspect of the model is the ability to enforce business rules
p2981
aVHTML does not do this with static content -- the web designer does by the choice of the HTML encoding
p2982
aVThis doesn't make it bad, or not useful
p2983
aVNot everything has to be MVC
p2984

p3112
aVI have two constructors for, in my case, a controller class the default constructor and one that takes the factory (and other injected objects)
p3113
aVThe default constructor simply calls the constructor with parameters with all the parameters null
p3114
aVThe parameterized constructor creates objects of default types if the corresponding parameter is null
p3115
aVUsing the factory allows my controller actions to create a new DataContext when invoked instead of having a single DataContext that exists throughout the life of the application

p3557
aV0 and
p3558
aVNet 1
p3559
aV1/1
p3560
aV0 share some of the same name spaces and classes and therefore you need to choose which set of libraries you want to use with your application
p3561
aVSince your application uses the libraries from
p3562
aVNet 2
p3563
aV0, you need your app pool set up to load these libraries for your application rather than the
p3564
aVNet 1
p3565
aV1 libraries
p3566
aVYou will also need
p3567
aVNet 3

aV5 installed on the web server, even though you only configure the app to use the (base)
p3569
aVNet 2

aVThis would basically be the equivalent of different versions of PHP

VI don't see the point
p3615
aVWhy not be explicit that the class implements the interface and have done with it
p3616
aVImplementing the interface is what tells other programmers that this class is supposed to behave in the way that interface defines

aVSimply having the same name and signature on a method conveys no guarantees that the intent of the designer was to perform similar actions with the method
p3618
aVThat may be, but why leave it up for interpretation (and misuse)
p3619
aVThe reason you can "get away" with this successfully in dynamic languages has more to do with TDD than with the language itself
p3620
aVIn my opinion, if the language offers the facility to give these sorts of guidance to others who use/view the code, you should use it
p3621
aVIt actually improves clarity and is worth the few extra characters

VI'll preface this by saying that I do mostly web development where much of the architecture is already decided in advance (WebForms, now MVC) and most of my projects are reasonably small, one-person efforts that take less than a year
p3776
aVI also know going in that I'll have an ORM and DAL to handle my business object and data interaction, respectively
p3777
aVRecently, I've switched to using LINQ for this, so much of the "design" becomes database design and mapping via the DBML designer
p3778
aVTypically, I work in a TDD (test driven development) manner
p3779
aVI don't spend a lot of time up front working on architectural or design details
p3780
aVI do gather the overall interaction of the user with the application via stories
p3781
aVI use the stories to work out the interaction design and discover the major components of the application
p3782
aVI do a lot of whiteboarding during this process with the customer -- sometimes capturing details with a digital camera if they seem important enough to keep in diagram form
p3783
aVMainly my stories get captured in story form in a wiki
p3784
aVEventually, the stories get organized into releases and iterations
p3785
aVBy this time I usually have a pretty good idea of the architecture
p3786
aVIf it's complicated or there are unusual bits -- things that differ from my normal practices -- or I'm working with someone else (not typical), I'll diagram things (again on a whiteboard)
p3787
aVThe same is true of complicated interactions -- I may design the page layout and flow on a whiteboard, keeping it (or capturing via camera) until I'm done with that section
p3788
aVOnce I have a general idea of where I'm going and what needs to be done first, I'll start writing tests for the first stories
p3789
aVUsually, this goes like:  "Okay, to do that I'll need these classes
p3790
aVI'll start with this one and it needs to do this
p3791
aVThen I start merrily TDDing along and the architecture/design grows from the needs of the application
p3792
aVPeriodically, I'll find myself wanting to write some bits of code over again or think "this really smells" and I'll refactor my design to remove duplication or replace the smelly bits with something more elegant
p3793
aVMostly, I'm concerned with getting the functionality down while following good design principles
p3794
aVI find that using known patterns and paying attention to good principles as you go along works out pretty well

VActually, I think if you started writing tests for this code before you wrote the class, your implementation would be different
p3857
aVFor example, you'd probably end up writing a constructor that initializes your collection so that you can reference it without having to check for null each time
p3858
aVI think it's probably a good practice to write the tests even if you don't think you need them
p3859
aVOften in writing the tests you find that there are a lot of assumptions that you've made that wouldn't have been addressed with your first code attempt
p3860
aVFor example, could the ContainerId ever be less than zero
p3861
aVWould it be an error to attempt to set it to a negative value
p3862
aVShould the collection be initialized by a constructor, i
p3863
ag117
aV, should classes that use this container class have to check for null before accessing or do you want to guarantee the collection will never be null, though it might be empty
p3864
aVThat said, I typically apply some sanity to the process
p3865
aVFor example, if I know that the constructor is internally scoped and objects are only created by a Factory class
p3866
aVI'll test the factory methods to ensure that they always produce legal objects, but not necessarily test the container class itself
p3867
aVI guess the bottom line, for me anyway, is to assume that classes need tests, attempt to write them, and only omit them when I can't think of a meaningful test to write

VThe default model binding takes form parameters by name and matches them up with the properties of the type specified in the argument list
p3982
aVFor example, your model has properties "Price" and "Name", then the form would need to contain inputs with ids/names "Price" and "Name" (I suspect it does a case insensitive match)
p3983
aVThe binder uses reflection to convert the form values associated with these keys into the appropriate type and assigns it to the properties of a newly created object of the type specified by the parameter (again derived by reflection)
p3984
aVYou can actually look at (and download) the source for this at http://www
p3985
aVcodeplex
p3986
aVcom/aspnet, although you'll have to drill down into the MVC source from there
p3987
aVI'd give a link to the DefaultModelBinder source, but the way they are constructed, I believe the link changes as revisions are introduced
p3988
aVSo, to answer your question, you need to have parameters (could be hidden) on your form that correspond to the properties of the object that you want to recreate
p3989
aVWhen you POST the form (in the view) to the controller, the binder should reconstitute an object of the specified type using the form parameters
p3990
aVIf  you need to do translation from the values in the form parameter to the object properties, you'll probably need to implement your own custom model binder

aV[EDIT]  In response to your second post:
p3992
aVLet's say that we want to have a link back to an action that uses a customized object
p3993
aVWe can store the customized object in TempData (or the Session if we need it to last more through more than one postback) with a particular key
p3994
aVWe can then construct the action link and provide the key of the object as value to the ActionLink in an anonymous class
p3995

VI would consider adding the textboxes client-side via javascript rather than posting back to the server to have the form redrawn, assuming that you can live with javascript as a requirement for using the application

aVAs a matter of preference I would probably have the Save method take a FormCollection parameter rather than deal with the Request object directly

VIt's an interesting question and one I hadn't considered
p4171
aVI did a little googling and came up with this paper (PDF) on refactoring in AOP that attempts to apply some mathematical modeling to aspects to show the that functional aspects have the same flexibility as traditional aspects but with reduced complexity
p4172
aVI didn't read the whole paper, but you might find something there
p4173
aVAnother interesting idea would be to think of refactorings along the same lines as compiler optimizations
p4174
aVEssentially, the compiler refactors your code on the fly, although with different goals than code-level refactoring
p4175
aVYou'd have to somehow quantify code complexity and readability in a reasonable way to demonstrate how a particular refactoring affects it
p4176
aVComing up with the model would probably be the hard part
p4177
aVI also found this paper that establishes an algebra of OO programming and derives some basic laws, then uses those basic rules to derive a more complicated refactoring

VLet's say that you have your category ids in an integer array and Name is a string
p4194
aVThe trick is to create the command text to allow you to enter all of your category ids as individual parameters and construct the fuzzy match for name
p4195
aVTo do the former, we use a loop to construct a sequence of parameter names @p0 through @pN-1 where N is the number of category ids in the array
p4196
aVThen we construct a parameter and add it to the command with the associated category id as the value for each named parameter
p4197
aVThen we use concatenation on the name in the query itself to allow the fuzzy search on name
p4198
aVThis is a fully parameterized query that should make your DBA happy
p4199
aVI suspect that since these are integers, though it would not be much of a security risk just to construct the command text directly with the values, while still parameterizing the name
p4200
aVIf your category ids are in a string array, just split the array on commas, convert each to an integer, and store it in the integer array
p4201
aVNote: I say array and use it in the example, but it should work for any collection, although your iteration will probably differ

p4427
aVYou don't really need to test methods on SqlCommand or SqlConnection (for example)
p4428
aVYou should assume that the framework components that you use work and create stubs or mocks for them that return known data (good, bad, exceptions) to your methods to make sure that your methods work properly

VClass and method attributes in

aVNET are a form of aspect-oriented programming
p4754
aVYou decorate your classes/methods with attributes
p4755

p4756
aVFor example, marking a class serializable allows it to be serialized automatically for storage or transmission to another system

aVOther attributes might mark certain properties as non-serializable and these would be automatically omitted from the serialized object
