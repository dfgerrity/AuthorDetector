p1742
aVI suspect that you actually want to know about the  interface
p1743
aVI recommend that you read this page on MSDN
p1744
aVThe  interface represents an operation (such as a web request or a database call) that is running in the background, while your code continues to execute
p1745
aVIt can tell you whether the operation finished (the  property)
p1746
aVIt also gives you a  object (the  property) which can be used to wait until the operation finishes
p1747
aV(By calling )
p1748
aVYou get an  by calling a  method
p1749
aV(, , and many others)
p1750
aVThe  method will take any parameters needed for the operation (For example,  can take a  parameter), and can take an AsyncCallback delegate (not interface) and a state parameter
p1751
aVIn returns an  object
p1752
aVThe AsyncCallback delegate is a method that you supply, which will be called when the operation finishes
p1753
aVIt will usually be called on a different thread, so be careful in it
p1754
aVYour AsyncCallback method will be given the same IAsyncResult that the  method gave you earlier
p1755
aVThe state parameter is put into the IAsyncResult and ignored by the system; you can use it in your AsyncCallback method to keep track of what the operation was for
p1756
aV(The state can be whatever you want it to be, including )
p1757
aVInside your AsyncCallback (or anywhere else), you can call the  method that corresponds to the  method you called in the first place
p1758
aVYou have to give it the IAsyncResult from  or from the AsyncCallback
p1759
aVWhen you call it, it will wait for the operation to finish (if it isn't already finished), and then give you back the operation's result
p1760
aV(Assuming the operation returns something; for example,  will return a )

aVIf any error occurred during the operation,  will throw an exception

VHere is one solution I've thought of:
p3318
aVManipulate the Excel data into a non-pivoted form with one row per transaction (per item per customer, or per pair of cells in the current structure)
p3319
aVI actually already did this in a failed attempt to import the transactions to QuickBooks
p3320
aVEach row would turn into one item in the bill (as opposed the the current, pivoted, form where each row turns into an entire page with many items)
p3321
aVThen, make a Word merge document that checks whether the current row is the first row for a different customer, and, if it is, include the entire text of the bill (as opposed to the items) in two (very large) IF field codes
p3322
aVAll of the rows would generate an item in the bill
p3323
aVEach customer's last row would follow that with the second half of the text for the old customer (the part after the items)
p3324
aVEach customer's first row would precede it with the first half of the text for the new customer (the part before the items)
p3325
aVTwo IFs are necessary to handle the first and last customer
p3326
aVI would have to add a formula column to the spreadsheet that tells me whether to insert the prefix, the suffix, or neither, as that's impossible to do in Word
p3327
aV(You can't peek the next record)
p3328
aVThe merge generator would still be a complicated monstrosity, but it would never need to change; new item types would be picked up from the source data
p3329
aV(Unlike the current merge generator which requires a new macro-generated field code for each new item type)

VThis message appears whenever you reload a page that was received from an HTTP POST
p5684
aVIt appears because HTTP POSTs are intended to be non-repeatable
p5685
aVFor example, if you buy something online, the website will usually send an HTTP POST to its server saying that you spent X dollars
p5686
aVWithout that warning, it would be possible for Firefox or IE to automatically reload the page, sending a second HTTP POST
p5687
aVThis would tell the server that you spent X dollars a second time, and would make you very angry
p5688
aVTherefore, the browsers have that warning
p5689
aVTo get rid of it, change your page to an HTTP GET
p5690
aVFor example:
p5691
aVAlternatively, you can keep it an HTTP POST, and have the server send a redirect in response to the POST, telling the browser to send an HTTP GET to a separate page

aVExplanation
p22983
aVNormal class methods are associated with an instance of the class
p22984
aVFor example, the  method can only be called on a  instance
p22985
aVIt would not make sense to call  without a string instance
p22986
aVSometimes, you will want to create a method that does not require a class instance
p22987
aVFor example, the  method is not called on an  instance
p22988
aVIt wouldn't make sense to have to create an  instance just to be able to call
p22989
aVThese methods are called  methods
p22990
aVis an example of a  method
p22991
aVSince it is not called on an instance of your  class, it cannot call instance methods
p22992
aV(Because there is no instance to call them with)

VYou're misunderstanding it

aVBoth examples are returning the 's  property, since they aren't being directly invoked on

aVThe value of the  keyword inside a function depends on the context in which the function was called
p23001
aVIn an ordinary function call (eg, ),  will be the global object, which is usually
p23002
aVIn an object method call (eg, ),  will be the object on which the function was invoked

VThis is undefined behavior
p38407
aVA string literal in C is a pointer to a a block of pre-initialized memory
p38408
aVBy coincidence, your two string literals occupy adjacent blocks of memory
p38409
aVWhen you add  to the pointer to the first literal, you end up pointing into the middle of the next literal
p38410
aVYour program's data is arranged in memory like this:
p38411
aV%c\u005c0sundaram\u005c0
