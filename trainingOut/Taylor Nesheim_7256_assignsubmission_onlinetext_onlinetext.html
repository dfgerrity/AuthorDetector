WRITTEN REVIEW:
The food at Thai Classic is very delicious. They have a very large selection of food to choose from, approximately 100 numbered dishes. I personally would recommend any of the curries.
The service at Thai Classic is pretty good albeit somewhat minimal. We hardly saw our waiter but the food came out quite quickly.
The venue was not that great. The first complaint is that the seat to table height ratio was off so that my elbows were too high up and my knees were angled oddly. The second complaint is that the lights kept flickering to a different hue.
Overall I would rate this restaurant as a four for their simply scrumptious food and fast cook time. They did not get a five because of their inadequate venue.
