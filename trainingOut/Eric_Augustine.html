WRITTEN REVIEW:
This is a five start place through and through. The food was delicious. They even had great bread. I had the chicken parmesan, and it was great. However, I think that the soup was the most delicious. I had a garlic chicken tomato soup.
The service was great. The people were friendly on responsive.
The venue was one of the most spectacular things about this place. It had really warm lighting and fancy decor. We sat right next to a fireplace.
The only complaint I have is the price, this place is not cheap. Especially for a lowly grad student. Besides that, it was a really enjoyable experience. Also, their beer selection was lacking and the wines were too expensive.
