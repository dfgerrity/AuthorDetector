WRITTEN REVIEW:
Taj Palace is a nice Indian restaurant conveniently situated fairly close to campus, on Foothill and Broad. The restaurant is family owned and operated, and offers a delightful variety of classic Indian food stuffs.
The food at Taj Palace always leaves me coming back for more. During lunch and on Monday nights, they have a buffet filled with the classics: daal, saag paneer, tikki masala, tandoori chicken, the works. All served with superbly fresh naan hot out of the oven. I always eat so much that my stomach aches for hours afterwards!
The service is as good as you could hope for a buffet. The owner is always attentive, as I’m always very thirsty when I come in, and he is always stopping by every couple minutes to joke that I have a hollow leg and continuously fills my cup. The employees greet you with smiling faces, and enjoy seeing people enjoy their food.
The venue is nothing much, but it’s as good as it needs to be. Simple tables and chairs, nothing fancy. A small buffet area offers all the goodness you could hope for. There are no extravagancies or fanciness, just a place to serve great food.
