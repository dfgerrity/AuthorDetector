WRITTEN REVIEW:
Moe's Smokehouse BBQ is a BBQ restaurant that primarily serves burgers, BBQribs, BBQ chicken, and various sandwiches. The selection was not terriblydiverse, but they had 'Killer Garlic Fries' which were sure to be a great hit.Sure enough, their BBQ tastes quite good and their garlic fries lived up to myexpectations of garlic-ness. Although, thinking back on it, it wasn'tparticularly memorable, so despite it being good and me quite enjoying it, Iwonder if it wasn't exceptional, hence the 4.
Service at Moe's smokehouse was wonderful, at least as far as BBQ grillrestaurants go. It didn't necessarily have the typical male server or registerworker that really gives BBQ or bar and grill restaurants a feel of ruggedness.However, the servers were quick to bring us our food, and despite not expectingany service they even asked if we needed anything a couple times. I think asfar as BBQ restaurants goes Moe's, at least today, had quite good service.
Moe's atmosphere was quite typical: A walk up register where you order, a sodafountain, and a look and feel very similar to most BBQ restaurants I've beento. Although, that being said, I also didn't pay much attention to any of theirpictures and artwork. I may have missed out on the appeal of the restaurantitself but I didn't think there is anything I would consider memorabledecorating their walls.
Moe's Smokehouse BBQ is exactly what you would expect, plus bonus taste andservice. I think it is definitely a good place to go every once in awhile. Ofcourse, being a BBQ restaurant it shouldn't be frequented too often, but theprice is affordable for a fair amount of food (including a lot of fries) andthe overall experience is quite comforting.
