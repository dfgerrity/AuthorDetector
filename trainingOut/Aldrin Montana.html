WRITTEN REVIEW:
Upper Crust Trattoria is an italian restaurant in San Luis Obispo. The food hasseveral very good qualities: very good taste (especially the soup), abundantbread (unlimited actually), and good proportions. Although I may have ate morebread than the average bear, I think that the size of the proportions leave yousatisfied and if necessary the bread is unlimited. Additionally, the bread goesmarvelously well both with the pasta sauce and the soup broth. The soup brothhad a very noticeable taste but not particularly overwhelming. The only problemI had with the food was that the pasta itself was not particularly flavored,but the meat (I had chicken marsala) tasted so absolutely wonderful it morethan made up for the lack of succulence in the pasta.
The service at Upper Crust was also very good. If my waiter was walking by thetable, we were sure to be asked how our food tasted and if we had any needs.The servers were also nice, appropriately talkative, and quick to smile.
Upper Crust had a definite atmosphere of elegance established. Much of thefurniture was made of some sort of wood, or made to look like wood, and thelighting was dim and warm. We had been placed in front of a fireplace (thoughnot lit) that even gave the restaurant a sort of cozy at home feel.Additionally there was an awesome drunk guy that tried his hand at chattingwith some ladies that was particularly amusing.
Overall, Upper Crust far exceeded my expectations. From the outside appearanceand the name I wasn't sure if the place was just a fancy pizza place beyond thelikes of California Pizza Kitchen. To my surprise, Upper Crust was a very greattasting italian restaurant with quite a bit of style and personality. I wouldhighly recommend Upper Crust to anyone and everyone (though it's expensive).
