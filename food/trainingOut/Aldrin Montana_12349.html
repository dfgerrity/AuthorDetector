WRITTEN REVIEW:
Mee Heng Low is a noodle house with a vague resemblance to Chinese noodles. MeeHeng Low offers four primary options of noodles and several meat options. Ofthe noodle options there is chow mein, low mein, soup, and some other option.The meat options included chicken, beef, shrimp, and some others. The food wasdecent. The noodles were done well, though not served hot. The vegetables werea nice consistency, not cooked too long but cooked enough that they clearlywere not raw. The saving grace of the meal overall was the subtle yet sweettaste of the sweet plum sauce. However, this was not nearly what I expected (Iexpected a sauce more similar to Hoisin plum sauce) and so while I acceptedthat the food was not bad, it was still something of a disappointment.
The service at Mee Heng Low was standard. Once my order was placed and the foodwas finished cooking, it was brought to me at my table. However, my water wasrefilled in a relatively timely manner. I think our server went a step abovewhen he explained why a customer that had ordered his food after me receivedhis food before me. I feel like it could go either way, the server could haveeasily carried on without mentioning to me why my food was slower in getting tomy table. I appreciate that he explained it and I think that deserved a bump inMee Heng Low's otherwise average score.
Mee Heng Low had a very casual, cozy atmosphere to it. It felt like an urbanbuilding -- some pipes exposed and the walls made of brick. I liked theambience that the decorations had to offer, and I very much enjoy theatmosphere that Mee Heng Low has managed to establish in their building.
Overall, I think Mee Heng Low was a relatively average experience, with bonuspoints for the atmosphere and quality of our server. I would not go to Mee HengLow very often, but it is certainly a place that I wouldn't mind going toevery now and then, possibly even suggest going to.
