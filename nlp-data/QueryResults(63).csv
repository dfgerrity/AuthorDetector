"<p>ASP.NET 2.0 web application, how to implement shortcut key combination of CTRL + , preferably through javascript, to make web application ergonomically better? How to capture multiple-key keyboard events through javascript?</p>
","9021","nickf","<p>Your event listener function, gets passed an Event object. That has a lot of useful information on it, including the properties ""altKey"", ""ctrlKey"", ""shiftKey"" and ""metaKey"". If any of the modifier keys are being held down when that event fires, the corresponding property is set to true.</p>

<p>This applies to keyboard as well as mouse events (onclick, etc). Note that if you have a onkeydown event listener, the modifier key itself will fire the event.</p>

<pre><code>window.onkeyup = function(e) {
  if (e.altKey) alert(""Alt pressed"");
  if (e.shiftKey) alert(""Shift pressed"");
}

"<p>When working with large and/or many Javascript and CSS files, what's the best way to reduce the file sizes?</p>
","9021","nickf","<p>For javascript, I use <a href=""http://dean.edwards.name/download/#packer"" rel=""nofollow"">Dean Edwards's Javascript Packer</a>. It's been ported to .NET, perl, php4, php5, WSH, and there's even an aptana plugin.</p>

<p>Javascript packing comes in a few flavours - some just strip out comments and whitespace, others will change your variable names to be concise, and others, well, I don't even know what they do, but the output sure is small. The high-end compression works by using the eval() function, which puts some extra burden on the client, so if your scripts are particularly complicated, or you're designing for slower hardware, keep that in mind. the Javascript packer gives you the option for which compression level you want to use.</p>

<p>For CSS, the best you can do is strip whitespace and comments. Thankfully that means that you can achieve that with a one-line function:</p>

<pre><code>function compressCSS($css) {
    return
        preg_replace(
            array('@\s\s+@','@(\w+:)\s*([\w\s,#]+;?)@'),
            array(' ','$1$2'),
            str_replace(
                array(""\r"",""\n"",""\t"",' {','} ',';}'),
                array('','','','{','}','}'),
                preg_replace('@/\*[^*]*\*+([^/][^*]*\*+)*/@', '', $css)
            )
        )
    ;
}
</code></pre>

<p>While that function and the Javascript packer will reduce the file size of individual files, to get the best performance from your site, you'll also want to be reducing the number of HTTP requests you make. Each Javascript and CSS file is a separate request, so combining them into one file each will the the optimal result. Instead of trying to maintain a single bohemoth JS file, you can use the program/technique I've written on my blog (shameless self plug) at <a href=""http://spadgos.com/?p=32"" rel=""nofollow"">http://spadgos.com/?p=32</a></p>

<p>The program basically reads a ""build script""-type file which will simultaneously combine and compress multiple Javascript and CSS files into one (of each) for you (or more, if you want). There are several options for the output and display of all files. There's a larger write-up there, and the source is freely available.</p>

"<p>We have a rather large svn repository.  Doing svn updates are taking longer and longer the more we add code.  We added svn:externals to folders that were repeated in some projects like the FCKeditor in various websites.  This helped but not that much.</p>

<p>What is the best way to reduce update time and boost SVN speed?</p>
","9021","nickf","<p>I've found in my own experience (ie: not through any <em>actual</em> tests) that, especially if the SVN repo server is remote, using externals seems to slow things down. If you've got duplicated code (like your FCK editor) in multiple places, I would tend to stick to using externals since keeping those files synchronised and manageable is more important than update speeds - though, you could look at using symbolic links to bring in duplicated code instead.

"<p>Is it possible to use <a href=""http://subversion.apache.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">Apache Subversion</a> (SVN) as general purpose backup tool? (As a kind of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync"" rel=""nofollow"">rsync</a> alternative.)</p>
","9021","nickf","<p>As a ""general purpose"" backup, I'd say it's probably not the greatest idea, mainly for the reasons given by others (lots of excess folders and wasted disk space). If you want to just keep backups, again I'd say there's probably better options, depending on your needs, eg: do you need to keep every single version of every single file, or would certain snapshots of your data be sufficient?</p>

<p>However, at my office, we have a small team of 6 who work with shared files (eg: policies and procedures manuals, registration forms, etc). A lot of the time, team members will be working remotely (from home or while travelling), and often offline. Rather than using a central shared-folder setup, we use SVN to give each person an entire working copy of the folder which they can work on and refer to and synchronise whenever possible. This kills two birds with one stone: everyone can access and edit the files even while offline, plus it gives us really great redundancy in our backups. If my laptop <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XHaz5EM9jc"" rel=""nofollow"">catches on fire</a>, it's no hassle because I can just check out another copy (obviously on another computer). If the server catches on fire, we'll have the backups of the repository to restore. If the server AND all the repo backups catch on fire, then all that you've lost are old versions of files. The only way that you'll lose any current data is if the server, your repo backups and every single computer which has a checkout all mysteriously catch on fire.</p>

<p>As some people have said though, SVN will never remove information from the repository, meaning that if you only want to keep backups for 60 days, then, well, you can't. This isn't exactly true. Through use of <a href=""http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.0/re10.html"" rel=""nofollow"">export</a>, <a href=""http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.1/re31.html"" rel=""nofollow"">dump</a> and <a href=""http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.0/re12.html"" rel=""nofollow"">import</a> you could effectively wipe out older versions of files. It's not pretty, but it's possible.</p>

"<p>I need to rotate an image at 12 midnight every day from a group of 5-10 images. How can I go about doing this with javascript or jquery or even php?</p>
","9021","nickf","<p><em>Edit: I totally misread this question as ""<strong>without</strong> using javascript/PHP"". So disregard this response. I'm not deleting it, just in case anyone was crazy enough to want to use this method.</em></p>

<p>Doing it without Javascript, PHP, or any other form of scripting language could be difficult. Well actually, it would just be very contrived, since it would be trivial with even the most basic JS/PHP.</p>

<p>Anyway, to actually answer your question, the only way I can think of doing it with vanilla HTML is to set up a shell script to run at midnight. That script would just rename your files. Do this with cron (on linux) or Windows Task Scheduler with a script kinda like this: <em>(dodgy pseudo code follows, convert to whatever you're comfortable with)</em>.</p>

<pre><code>let number_of_files = 5

rename current.jpg to number_of_files.jpg

for (x = 2 to number_of_files)
    rename x.jpg to (x-1).jpg

rename 1.jpg to current.jpg
</code></pre>

<p>In your HTML, just do this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;img src=""path/to/current.jpg"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And every day, current.jpg should change to something new. If you're using any sort of cache-control, make sure to change it so that it doesn't get cached for longer than a few hours.</p>

"<p>For a particular project I have, no server side code is allowed. How can I create the web site in php (with includes, conditionals, etc) and then have that converted into a static html site that I can give to the client?</p>

","9021","nickf","<p>If you have a number of pages, with all sorts of request variables and whatnot, probably one of the spidering tools the other commenters have mentioned (wget, lwp-mirror, etc) would be the easiest and most robust solution.</p>

<p>However, if the number of pages you need to get is low, or at least <em>manageable</em>, you've got a few options which don't require any third party tools (not that you should discount them JUSt because they are third party).</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You can use php on the command line to get it to output directly into a file.</p>

<p><code>php myFile.php &gt; myFile.html</code></p>

<p>Using this method could get painful (though you could put it all into a shell script), and it doesn't allow you to pass variables in the same way (eg: <code>php myFile.php?abc=1</code> won't work).</p></li>
<li><p>You could use another PHP file as a ""build"" script which contains a list of all the URLs you want and then grabs them via <code>file_get_contents()</code> or <code>file()</code> and writes them to a local file. Using this method, you can also get it to check if the file has changed (<code>md5_file()</code> should work for that), so you'll know what to give your client, should they only want updates.</p></li>
<li><p>Further to #2, before you write the output to file, scan it for local urls and then add those to your list of files to download. While you're there, change those urls to link to what you'll eventually name your output so you have a functioning web at the end. Note of caution here - if this is sounding good, you could probably use one of the tools which already exist and do this for you.</p></li>

You don't need a DTD for DOMDocument to parse custom XML. Just use <code>DOMDocument-&gt;load()</code>, and as long as the XML is well-formed, it can read it.</p>

<p>Once you get the files to be well-formed, that's when you can start looking at XML parsers, before that you're S.O.L. Lok Alejo said, you could look at <a href=""http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy/"" rel=""nofollow"">HTML TIDY</a>, but it looks like that's specific to HTML, and I don't know how it would go with your custom elements.</p>

","9021","nickf","<p>Here's a solution which will choose a random image per day from a directory, which might be easier than some other solutions posted here, since all you have to do to get something into the rotation is upload it, rather than edit an array, or name the files in arbitrary ways.</p>

<pre><code>function getImageOfTheDay() {

<p>Run a regex (sorry!) over the tags, and when it finds one which isn't a valid HTML element, replace it with a valid element that you know doesn't exist in any of the documents (<code>blink</code> comes to mind...), and give it an attribute value with the name of the illegal element, so that you can switch it back afterwards. eg:</p>

"<p>In PHP, the HEREDOC string declarations are really useful for outputting a block of html.  You can have it parse in variables just by prefixing them with $, but for more complicated syntax (like $var[2][3]), you have to put your expression inside {} braces.</p>

<p>In PHP 5, it <em>is</em> possible to actually make function calls within {} braces inside a HEREDOC string, but you have to go through a bit of work.  The function name itself has to be stored in a variable, and you have to call it like it is a dynamically-named function.  For example:</p>

<pre><code>$fn = 'testfunction';
function testfunction() { return 'ok'; }
$string = &lt;&lt;&lt; heredoc
plain text and now a function: {$fn()}
heredoc;
</code></pre>

<pre><code>$string = &lt;&lt;&lt; heredoc
plain text and now a function: {testfunction()}
heredoc;

<p>There are other ways besides the first code example, such as breaking out of the HEREDOC to call the function, or reversing the issue and doing something like:</p>

&lt;!-- directly output html and only breaking into php for the function --&gt;
plain text and now a function: &lt;?PHP print testfunction(); ?&gt;

The problem is that when the function runs and includes the file scope, is lost because the include ran inside a function. This becomes a problem because I use a global configuration file, then I use specific configuration files for each module on the site.

"<p>I'm trying to display a series of titles varying from 60 characters to 160 or so and the capitalization varies, some of it all caps, some half caps.  When it's mostly lowercase the whole 160 characters of text fits in the width I want, but when it starts getting more caps (they must be wider), it starts over flowing.</p>

<p>Is there a way to use an attractive fixed witdh font (upper and lowercase widths the same too), or dynamically shrink the text to fit, or otherwise recognize how much space the text is going to take on the server side, and cut off the end dynamically?  Or do you folks have a better solution?</p>
","9021","nickf","<p>You could try using javascript to programmatically test to see the width of the font, and if it's too large, take it down a step and try again. Instead of testing the width, see if the height of the element is more than one line (measured in ems, since you'll be changing the font size around).</p>

","9021","nickf","<p>Don't listen to the people saying that this is tabular data. Just because something has been presented in rows, it doesn't make it a table!</p>

<p>This is a great situation to use the <code>dl</code>, <code>dt</code> and <code>dd</code> tags. It's a <em>bit</em> of a stretch from what they're originally intended for, but it's still much more meaningful than a table, spans or divs.</p>

<p>That's fairly basic CSS - it probably won't hold up to a lot of situations (eg: two <code>dd</code>'s in a row, a really long <code>dt</code>), but it's a start.

"<p>I'm  trying to design an application to hold academic reference information. The problem is that each different type of reference (eg. journal articles, books, newspaper articles etc) requires different information.

<p>Therefore, should I have all the references stored in one table in my database and just leave fields blank when they don't apply, or should I have various tables such as BookReferences, JournalReferences, NewspaperReferences and put the appropriate references in each one.

","9021","nickf","<p>There's another option: not one I'd fully endorse, but it's still another option:</p>

<p>Use three tables:</p>

<pre><code>refs (id, title, refType)
-- title of the reference, and what type of reference it is

fieldDef (id, fieldName, refType, dataType)
-- name of the field, which reference types it applies to, and
-- what type of data is stored in these fields (ISDN number, date, etc)

fields (refId, fieldId, value)
-- where you actually add data to the references.
</code></pre>

<p><code>refType</code> can be the type of reference, and if you make it an integer with values increase by powers of two (1, 2, 4, 8...) then they can be added together to make a bitmask in the fieldDef table.</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong>: very simple and extensible. If you come up with another type of reference, or a new field type for an existing reference type, it can be added in very quickly. Forms can be automatically generated for each reference type. All data is stored in one place, meaning you don't need to keep track of multiple schemas <em>(schemata?)</em> for <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete"" rel=""nofollow"">CRUD operations</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Cons</strong>: this is the stuff that The Daily WTF is made on. Select statements can become very confusing and complicated. The database can't perform type-checking (eg: for dates, etc), and the generic ""value"" field will not be optimised for the data being stored in it.</p>

"<p>I'm trying to work through Project Euler and I'm hitting a barrier on problem 03. I have an algorithm that works for smaller numbers, but problem 3 uses a very, very large number.</p>

<p><strong>Problem 03:</strong>
The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.
What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143?</p>

        half = n / 2;

        for (long i = half; i &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; largestPrime == 0; i--) {

","9021","nickf","<p>For starters, instead of beginning your search at n / 2, start it at the square root of n. You'll get half of the factors, the other half being their complement.</p>

<p>eg:</p>

<pre><code>n = 27
start at floor(sqrt(27)) = 5
is 5 a factor? no
is 4 a factor? no
is 3 a factor? yes. 27 / 3 = 9. 9 is also a factor.
is 2 a factor? no.
factors are 3 and 9.

"<p>I've often read that corporations will save millions once Internet Explorer 6 is finally laid to rest, but reading quotes like that make me wonder just how much time people are spending on IE6 development. I'll be happy once IE6 goes, but I've found that if I write valid HTML and CSS, use a JavaScript framework, keep the transparent images issue in mind, and don't try to over-complicate my design, I only need to write a few lines of IE6-specific CSS, which usually takes about 10-15 minutes. So I'm curious, how much time, effort, and money do you or your corporation spend on preparing your sites for IE6? Also, at what point will you drop IE6 support? If you've already dropped support, what has been your experience in terms of saved time and money and what has the switch done to your conversion rates and customer satisfaction?</p>

"<p>Given a template where the HTML cannot be modified because of other requirements, how is it possible to display (rearrange) a <code>div</code> above another <code>div</code> when they are not in that order in the HTML? Both <code>div</code>s contain data that varies in height and width.</p>

Alternatively, store just the basic, common fields in one table, and the extra information in another table, one row per field.

refs (id, title, refType)
-- title of the reference, and what type of reference it is

fieldDef (id, fieldName, refType, dataType)
-- name of the field, which reference types it applies to, and
-- what type of data is stored in these fields (ISDN number, date, etc)

fields (refId, fieldId, value)
-- where you actually add data to the references.

<p>Edit: since you say that it will be holding things like per-user settings (eg: widget colour), I'd actually recommend the method outlined above (with the three tables).

"<p>I have a case where I have a bunch of text boxes and radio buttons on a screen all built dynamically with various DIVs.  There are onblur routines for all of the text boxes to validate entry, but depending on the radio button selection, the text box entry could be invalid when it was valid originally.  I can't use onblur with the radio buttons because they could go from the radio button into one of the text boxes that was made invalid and create an infinite loop since I'm putting focus into the invalid element.  Since each text box has its own special parameters for the onblur calls, I figure the best way to do this is to call the onblur event for the textboxes when the form gets submitted to make sure all entry is still valid with the radio button configuration they have selected.  I also need it to stop submitting if one of the onblur events returns false so they can correct the textbox that is wrong.  This is what I've written...</p>

In the first case, it returns true and then quits and aborts the submit after the first textbox even though there was no error with the first textbox.  In the second case, it returns false and runs through all the boxes.  Even though there might have been errors (which it displays), it doesn't think there are any errors, so it continues on with the submit.

"<p>What is the best approach to calculating the largest prime factor of a number?</p>

<li>If not, find next lowest</li>

<pre><code>712 / 2 = 356 .. 356 / 2 = 178 .. 178 / 2 = 89 .. 89 / 89 = 1
</code></pre>

<p>using this method you don't have to actually calculate any primes: they'll all be primes, based on the fact that you've already factorised the number as much as possible with all preceding numbers.</p>

<pre><code>number = 712;
currNum = number;    // the value we'll actually be working with
for (currFactor in 2 .. number) {
    while (currNum % currFactor == 0) {
        // keep on dividing by this number until we can divide no more!
        currNum = currNum / currFactor     // reduce the currNum
    }
    if (currNum == 1) return currFactor;    // once it hits 1, we're done.
}

"<p>As someone who is only barely proficient in javascript, is jQuery right for me?  Is there a better library to use?  I've seen lots of posts related to jQuery and it seems to be the most effective way to incorporate javascript into ASP.NET applications.</p>

<p>I've been out to <a href=""http://jquery.com/"">jQuery's</a> site and have found the tutorials and other helpful information.  Any other reference material (i.e books, blogs, etc.) would be helpful.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","9021","nickf","<p><strong>Pros</strong>: jQuery is a great library which lets you get what you want done in much <em>much</em> <strong><em>much</em></strong> less code, with a lot less hassle. The plugin architecture is incredibly simple, and the community producing plugins is very strong and active. If you can think ""wouldn't it be nice if I could..."" then chances are there's a plugin for it.</p>

<p><strong>Cons</strong>: You are being abstracted away from the raw Javascript. Don't underestimate the effect of this ""con"". Though working in vanilla JS (that is, javascript without libraries), can be a massive pain, it gives you a much better understanding of what you're actually doing. You might find that your jQuery based solutions could actually be done in vanilla JS with a lot less overhead.</p>

"<p>Using PHP, what's the fastest way to convert a string like this: <code>""123""</code> to an integer?</p>

<p>Why is that particular method the fastest? What happens if it gets unexpected input, such as <code>""hello""</code> or an array?</p>
","9021","nickf","<p>I've just set up a quick benchmarking exercise:</p>

<pre><code>Function             time to run 1 million iterations
--------------------------------------------
(int) ""123"":                0.55029
intval(""123""):              1.0115  (183%)

(int) ""0"":                  0.42461

(int) int:                  0.1502
intval(int):                0.65716 (438%)

(int) array(""a"", ""b""):      0.91264
intval(array(""a"", ""b"")):    1.47681 (162%)

intval(""hello""):            0.93678 (222%)

<p>On average, calling intval() is two and a half times slower, and the difference is the greatest if your input already is an integer.</p>

<p>I'd be interested to know <em>why</em> though.</p>

<p>You already have all your information in an SVN repository, so why not take advantage of that?</p>

<p>You keep a working copy on your computer for development and testing. Save and commit your changes to SVN. On your server, do an SVN <code>export</code> (or <code>checkout</code>, with appropriate server rules to block web access to the <code>.svn</code> folders), and you're sweet!</p>

"<p>On Windows Mobile, I am displaying my output in HTML. This includes lots of user-generated strings. Occasionally there are situations where a really large string is part of the output that has no whitespaces or punctuation. </p>

<p>Unfortunately the Windows Mobile's HTML view (htmlview.dll, based on Pocket Internet Explorer) does not break these long words down so they fit on screen. Instead a horizontal scrollbar is added and the user has to scroll sideways to see the whole word. This also affects other output which now also is spread along this larger screen width.</p>

<p>Is there any possibility to either make the htmlview behave differently, or to force the word to break? CSS can be used. Regarding the forcing: The &amp;shy; tag is ALWAYS inserting a ""-"" character and never causes a breaks, the &lt;WBR&gt; tag is not doing anything at all, &amp;8203; is output as &amp;8203:, empty tags like <B></B> also do nothing. Also it should be noted that this code is running on multiple screen sizes and due to other parts of the HTML output I am not 100% sure how much screen width I have left.</p>

<p>P.S.: My app is compiled using the WM 5.0 SDK and is written in C++/Win32/MFC.</p>
","9021","nickf","<p>I don't know pretty much anything about Windows Mobile, so I could be way off, but what you could try doing is inserting HTML entities at certain periods throughout long words which act as hyphenation ""hints"".</p>

<p>Since I assume it's only IE which runs on WinMo, the entity you'd be looking for is called the ""shy hyphen"": <code>&amp;shy;</code> It's basically a character which tells the browser that ""this point would be a good place to break the word, only if you need to"". If it does need to break the word over two (or more!) lines, then a hyphen is inserted, otherwise it is completely invisible.</p>

<p>I found this info <a href=""http://gojomo.blogspot.com/2005/03/cross-browser-invisible-word-break-in.html"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>, which also has more details about how to do this in other browsers.</p>

<p>The way I'd get them into your HTML in the first place would be to search for words which are longer than X characters (say, 30), and then in those words, after every Y characters (say, 20), insert the <code>&amp;shy;</code></p>

   &lt;li&gt;pear&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Both the <code>ul</code>'s and the <code>li</code>'s widths appear to be 100%. If I apply a <code>background-color</code> to the list item, the highlight stretches the full width of the page.</p>

<p>I only want the background highlight to stretch as wide as the widest item (with maybe some padding). How do I constrain the <code>li</code>'s (or perhaps the <code>ul</code>'s) width to the width of the widest item?</p>
","9021","nickf","<p>Exactly as BoltBait said, wrap your text in an inline element, such as <code>span</code> and give that the class.</p>

<p>My extra 2 cents is that if you don't have access to change the HTML, you can do it using Javascript. In jQuery:</p>

<pre><code>$('li.highlight').wrapInner(""&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;"");

<p>and use the CSS:</p>

<pre><code>li.highlight span { background-color: #f0f; }

<p>edit: after re-reading your question, can you clarify: do you want the highlight to only go as wide as the element which is highlighted, or as wide as the widest element in the list? eg:</p>

<pre>
    - short
    - items ********************
    - here
    - and then a really long one

<p>Is there a more elegant method?(single line)</p>
","9021","nickf","<p>You might be having issues with other CSS rules overriding the one you want. Even if it is declared last in the file, other declarations might have more importance and hence your will be ignored. eg:</p>

<pre><code>#myDiv .myClass a {
    color: red;
}
#myDiv a {
    color: blue;
}

<p>Because the first rule is <strong>more specific</strong> it takes precedence. Here's a page explaining CSS Specificity: <a href=""http://www.htmldog.com/guides/cssadvanced/specificity/"">http://www.htmldog.com/guides/cssadvanced/specificity/</a></p>

<p>The reason your jQuery solution works is because applying a style via the <code>style=""""</code> parameter has very high specificity.</p>

<p>The best way to find which rules are being applied and which are being overruled by others is to use the Firebug extension for Firefox. Inspect the element in that and click on the CSS tab: it will show you every single CSS declaration which is being applied, and put a strike-through on ones which are being overruled.</p>

<p>If you want a really quick and easy way to solve your problem though, try this:</p>

<pre><code>#dvTheatres a:hover {
    text-decoration: underline !important;

"<p>I have extensively used Prototype before and it helped us add considerable interactivity to our web applications. However we are looking at making the move to use jQuery in order to standardize on something better supported in Visual Studio.</p>

<p>I understand that we can use the jQuery.noConflict to run it alongside Prototype, but we would like to avoid having users need to download both libraries to use our website.</p>

"<p>Im thinking of updating my practices, and looking for a little help and advice!</p>

<p>I do a lot of work on sites that run joomla, oscommerce, drupal etc and so I have created a lot of custom components/plugins and hacks etc. Currently each site has its own folder on my xampp setup.  What I would like to do is have a default setup of (for example) a Joomla setup and when I make changes updates, I can do something which updates all the other folders that contain joomla, almost like an auto update?</p>

<p>Im also looking at using Aptana IDE more and SVN service such as <a href=""http://unfuddle.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">unfuddle</a> to share my work with others, but I have not used SVN before and not sure if its possible to do the above using SVN?</p>

<p>It would be great to be able to work on a main/core item and send the updates to both local updates and to actual servers, without having to maintain lots of different individual sites.</p>

<p>Suggestions?</p>
","9021","nickf","<p>Yes, SVN would be a great tool for this purpose. Store your code (eg: a custom Joomla component) in source control. Wherever you want to use that component, just do a <code>checkout</code> or <code>export</code> of that particular folder into your live site. Here's one way you could structure your repository:</p>

<pre>unfuddle.com/myRepo/trunk/com_myComponent
unfuddle.com/myRepo/trunk/com_anotherComponent
</pre>

<p>Log in to your live server via SSH and run this command:</p>

<pre>
> cd path/to/joomla/components
> svn co http://unfuddle.com/myRepo/trunk/com_myComponent
</pre>

<p>Any time you change your code, commit the changes and then log back into the server and run:</p>

<pre>
> cd path/to/joomla/components
> svn up com_myComponent
</pre>

<p>A real benefit of this is that should you do an update and break something, you can always roll it back to the last known ""good"" version.</p>

<p>As for automating this process, you might be out of luck if it's on different servers. For multiple deployments on the same server, you could quite easily write a shell script to run the above commands for each site/component. If you needed this to be fully automated, you could even set up a cron job to run this script every day at 2am or something - personally I'd stick with the manual approach, but it's still an option.</p>

<p>For working locally with your SVN repositories, I'd recommend looking at <a href=""http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">TortoiseSVN</a> (if you're on Windows): it's the simplest and easiest way to work with SVN.</p>

"<p>Currently I have subversion set up so that when I make changes in Eclipse PDT, I can commit the changes and they will be saved in /home/administrator/<em>Project File</em>.  This file has the /branches /tags and /trunk directories recommended by subversion.  I have no problem properly uploading files to the repository, but do I have to ""mv"" the files in Linux to /var/www in order to make them live on the server?  Is there an automatic process to do this that I am missing?  I'm assuming we don't want to make the /var/www directory (which is live on the machine) the repository, but I don't know.</p>
","9021","nickf","<p>You can do an <code>svn export</code> into your www directory. That will give you a ""clean"" version of your repo, without the .svn directories.</p>

<p>Edit: adding in some good ideas from the comments...</p>

<p>Some options for when you want to update your exported copy:</p>

<ul>
<li>run <code>svn export --force /home/...../ MyProject</code> this will stop it complaining about overwriting the existing files. This method will mean that if you delete a file from your repository, it'll still remain in your www folder.</li>
<li>change your SVN command to export into a new directory each time:<br />
<code>svn export /home/..../ MyProject_20081105</code><br />
and then create a symlink to that folder:<br />
<code>ln -s MyProject_20081105 MyProject</code><br />
Just delete and recreate the symlink each time you ""release"". In this case, the export directory doesn't need to be in the <code>www</code> folder at all.</li>

"<p>For my small wiki application, I mostly need to have the textarea used to edit the contents to use soft (or virtual) wrapping. However, in some cases, not wrapping the content would be preferable. I thought I would do this by simply having a button to turn off wrapping. Here is the simplified code:</p>

It looks as though Firefox actually does use the <code>wrap</code> attribute, but it won't let you change it.</p>

<p>I do have a solution though! It's pretty awful, but here it is. Completely replace the textarea with a new one.</p>

<pre><code>// this is the onclick handler for your button
document.getElementById(""nowrapButton"").onclick = function() {
  var oldOne = this.form.content;  // the old textarea
  var newOne = document.createElement('textarea'); // the new textarea
  var attrs = ['name', 'rows', 'cols']; // these are the attributes to keep
  for (var i = 0; i &lt; attrs.length; ++i) {
    // copy the attributes to the new one
    newOne.setAttribute(attrs[i], oldOne.getAttribute(attrs[i]));
  }

  // toggle the wrapping on and off
  if (oldOne.getAttribute('wrap') != 'off') {
    newOne.setAttribute('wrap', 'off');
  }

  // copy the text over
  newOne.value = oldOne.value;

<p><hr /></p>

<p>PHP doesn't allow you to chain together the return statements from functions like in many other languages. eg, in Javascript:</p>

<pre><code>document.getElementById('abc').style.color = ""#fff"";
</code></pre>

<p>It's a bit of a pain, but that's just how it is. The equivalent which you have to do in PHP is by storing temporary variables. Here's the above as you'd have to write it, if it were PHP: (obviously these aren't real PHP functions)</p>

<pre><code>$myElement = $document-&gt;getElementById('abc');
$myElement-&gt;style-&gt;color = ""#fff"";
</code></pre>

<p>One little positive of this is that it makes debugging a wee bit easier.</p>

<p>Note that this only applies to functions: you can ""chain"" properties of objects:</p>

<pre><code>$myObject-&gt;myArray[5]-&gt;anotherProperty-&gt;anotherArray[3]-&gt;anotherObject-&gt;aFunction();

"<p>I asked this question before, <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/264441/does-a-native-php-5-function-exist-that-does-the-following-in-1-line"">Here</a> however I think I presented the problem poorly, and got quite a few replies that may have been useful to someone but did not address the actual question and so I pose the question again.</p>

<p>Is there a single-line native method in php that would allow me to do the following.
Please, please, I understand there are other ways to do this simple thing, but the question I present is does something exist <strong>natively in PHP</strong> that will <strong>grant me access to the array</strong> values directly <strong>without having to create a temporary array</strong>.</p>

<pre><code>$rand_place = explode("","",loadFile(""csvOf20000places.txt"")){rand(0,1000)};
</code></pre>

<p>This is a syntax error, however ideally it would be great if this worked!</p>

<p>Currently, it seems unavoidable that one must create a temporary array, ie</p>

<p><strong>The following is what I want to avoid:</strong></p>

<pre><code>$temporary_places_array = explode("","",loadFile(""csvOf20000places.txt""));
$rand_place = $temporary_places_array[rand(0,1000)];
</code></pre>

<p>Also, i must note that my actual intentions are not to parse strings, or pull randomly from an array. <strong>I simply want access into the string without a temporary variable</strong>. This is just an example which i hope is easy to understand. There are many times service calls or things you do not have control over returns an array (such as the explode() function) and you just want access into it without having to create a temporary variable.</p>

<p><strong>NATIVELY NATIVELY NATIVELY, i know i can create a function that does it.</strong></p>

<p><em>Update</em>: I thought I'd update this post since it still gets quite a bit of traffic. In the comments below there's some discussion about <code>$(""&lt;div&gt;"")</code> vs <code>$(""&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;"")</code> vs <code>$(document.createElement('div'))</code> as a way of creating new elements, and which is ""best"".</p>

<p>I put together <a href=""http://jsbin.com/elula3"">a small benchmark</a>, and here's roughly the results of repeating the above options 100,000 times:</p>

<p><strong>jQuery 1.4, 1.5, 1.6</strong></p>

<pre><code>               Chrome 11  Firefox 4   IE9
&lt;div&gt;            440ms      640ms    460ms
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;      420ms      650ms    480ms
createElement    100ms      180ms    300ms
</code></pre>

<p><strong>jQuery 1.3</strong></p>

<pre><code>                Chrome 11
&lt;div&gt;             770ms
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;      3800ms
createElement     100ms
</code></pre>

<p><strong>jQuery 1.2</strong></p>

<pre><code>                Chrome 11
&lt;div&gt;            3500ms
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;      3500ms
createElement     100ms
</code></pre>

<p>I think it's no big surprise, but <code>document.createElement</code> is the fastest method. Of course, before you go off and start refactoring your entire codebase, remember that the differences we're talking about here (in all but the archaic versions of jQuery) equate to about an extra 3 milliseconds <em>per thousand elements</em>. </p>

<p><strong>Update 2</strong></p>

<p>Updated for jQuery 1.7.2 and put the benchmark on JSPerf which is probably a bit more scientific than my primitive benchmarks, plus it can be crowdsourced now!</p>

"<p>I am working on a small parser that should accept input in a number of languages. I am going to have maybe 50 strings that will serve as keywords/anchors in parsing the input. In PHP, what would be the best way to organize these translated keywords? </p>

<p>One possible solution that comes to my mind is to use an associative array. Like this:</p>

<pre><code>$lang = array('us' =&gt; array('totalDebt' =&gt; 'Total Debt', 'color' =&gt; 'Color'),
              'gb' =&gt; array('totalDebt' =&gt; 'Total Debt', 'color' =&gt; 'Colour'))
</code></pre>

<p>which I could then access using the following:</p>

<pre><code>$langCode = 'en';
$debtPos = strpos($lang[$langCode]['totalDebt']);
</code></pre>

<p>Are there any better, proven methods for dealing with a bunch of short strings translated into a bunch of languages?</p>
","9021","nickf","<p>As Peter said, you've got the right idea, but separate your languages into different files. It means that PHP won't have to store the array of every single word in every single language. Because you only are going to be loading one language at a time, you can skip the <code>$lang['us']</code> level of nesting too.</p>

<p>You could even ""extend"" languages:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php // lang.en-gb.php
$lang = array(
    'color' =&gt; ""Colour"",
    'totalDebt' =&gt; ""Total Debt"",
    ...
);
?&gt;

&lt;?php // lang.en-us.php
include('lang.en-gb.php');

$lang['color'] = ""Color"";
// don't need to redefine ""totalDebt""
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You might even consider creating a basic class which handles all this for you: detect the locale, choose the correct file, have ""error"" handling, if a term isn't defined in a particular language, etc.</p>

"<p>I have a bunch of images that need to rotate in and out one at a time every 2 seconds with fancy JQuery fadeIn and fadeOut.  I have all the images in the HTML to pre-load them and a setInterval timer that fades the current image out, then fades the next image in.  Problem is that sometimes when you are clicking or scrolling during the fade in/out process, the JS gets interrupted and the current image never disappears and the next one fades in giving you two images.</p>

"<p>This is a little confusing to explain, so bear with me here...</p>

<p>I want to set up a system where a user can send templated emails via my website, except it's not actually sent using my server - it instead just opens up their own local mail client with an email ready to go. The application would fill out the body of the email with predefined variables, to save the user having to type it themselves. They can then edit the message as desired, should it not exactly suit their purposes.</p>

<p>There's a number of reasons I want it to go via the user's local mail client, so getting the server to send the email is not an option: it has to be 100% client-side.</p>

<p>I already have a mostly-working solution running, and I'll post the details of that as an answer, I'm wondering if there's any better way?</p>
","9021","nickf","<p>The way I'm doing it now is basically like this:</p>

<p>The HTML:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;textarea id=""myText""&gt;
    Lorem ipsum...
&lt;/textarea&gt;
&lt;button onclick=""sendMail(); return false""&gt;Send&lt;/button&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The Javascript:</p>

<pre><code>function sendMail() {
    var link = ""mailto:me@example.com""
             + ""?cc=myCCaddress@example.com""
             + ""&amp;subject="" + escape(""This is my subject"")
             + ""&amp;body="" + escape(document.getElementById('myText').value)
    ;

    window.location.href = link;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This, surprisingly, works rather well. The only problem is that if the body is particularly long (somewhere over 2000 characters), then it just opens a new email but there's no information in it. I suspect that it'd be to do with the maximum length of the URL being exceeded.</p>

<p>On the item entry page, I'll have it so that initially there's one text input for ""categories"" and if it's tabbed out of while it's empty, the input field is deleted (unless it's the only one) and focus skips to the next field.

  <p>thanks for the answer! i've tried it but it doesn't seem to work as intended. i'm on mac firefox. if i tab off the last field, it adds the new one but focuses the address bar. i tried adding: <code>$copy.find("":text"").focus();</code> after the insertAfter line, but it doesn't change anything. any ideas?</p>
  
  <p>also if i shift-tab the blurhandler doesn't know i'm going in the opposite direction. is there any way around that? </p>

<p>Hmm, I hadn't thought about that. What you could try doing is to put an element after all your text fields which can take focus (like a textbox which is rendered off-screen, eg: <code>margin-left: -10000px</code>). Add an onfocus handler onto that to see if the last row is empty, and if it is, then it would have been added just then by the onBlurHandler function, so pass the focus back to the last row. If the last row isn't empty, then pass the focus onto the next element (your submit button, probably). If there are issues with the last row not existing in the DOM yet, then put the above into a timeout.</p>

<p>(If this actually works) this should let your users tab backwards and forwards without hassle.</p>

"<p>How would I go about creating a real world form creation class that I can use to display a new form with fields of different types, as how many fields I want, I can use drop downs and I can do all of this by using OOP?</p>
","9021","nickf","<p>You definitely can. Consider a Form class which stores information about the form itself: the <code>method</code>, <code>action</code>, <code>enctype</code> attributes. Also throw in stuff like an optional heading and/or description text at the top. Of course you will also need an array of input elements. These could probably be put into their own class (though subclassing them for InputText, InputCheckbox, InputRadio maybe be a bit over the top). Here's a vague skeleton design:</p>

<pre><code>class Form {
    var $attributes,    // array, with keys ['method' =&gt; 'post', 'action' =&gt; 'mypage.php'...]
        $heading,
        $description,
        $inputs        // array of FormInput elements
    ;

    function render() {
        $output = ""&lt;form "" . /* insert attributes here */ ""&gt;""
              . ""&lt;h1&gt;"" . $this-&gt;heading . ""&lt;/h1&gt;""
              . ""&lt;p&gt;"" . $this-&gt;description . ""&lt;/p&gt;""
        ;
        // wrap your inputs in whatever output style you prefer:
        // ordered list, table, etc.
        foreach ($this-&gt;inputs as $input) {
            $output .= $input-&gt;render();
        }
        $output .= ""&lt;/form&gt;"";
        return $output;
    }
}

<p>The FormInput class would just need to store the basics, such as type, name, value, label. If you wanted to get tricky then you could apply validation rules which would then be converted to Javascript when rendering.</p>

"<p>Can someone show me how to get the <code>top</code> &amp; <code>left</code> position of a <code>div</code> or <code>span</code> element when one is not specified?</p>

<p>ie:</p>

<p>In the above, if I do: </p>

<pre><code>document.getElementById('11a').style.top

","9021","nickf","<p>This function will tell you the x,y position of the element relative to the page. Basically you have to loop up through all the element's parents and add their offsets together.</p>

<pre><code>var x = el.offsetLeft, y = el.offsetTop;

</code></pre>
","9021","nickf","<p>I just tested that in IE7 and can confirm that it happens there too.</p>

<p>It looks like the unstyled paragraph <strong>does not</strong> actually have a red background, it's just that IE7 is drawing the red box for the empty paragraph and then drawing the following paragraph over the top.</p>

<p>You can see this for yourself by trying this code:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;p style='background-color:green'&gt;Green content&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style='background-color:red; margin-left:50px'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<p>You should see that the red paragraph is 50px in from the left.</p>

<p><em>Why</em> it's doing this is anyone's guess. Adding some code to check if the paragraph is going to be empty isn't too hard, plus it removes useless markup from your output and avoids this problem altogether. Give that a go?</p>

<p>AFAIK the &amp; shouldn't be encoded because it is a separator for the key value pair.</p>

<p>For those who care: I send these pars as querystring and not as ""/"" seperated values because there is no decent way of passing on optional parameters that I know of.</p>

<p>To put all the bits together:</p>

<ul>
<li>an anchor (&lt;a>) tag's href attribute needs an encoded value</li>
<li>&amp; encodes to &amp;amp;</li>
<li>to encode an '&amp;' when it is part of your parameter's value, use %26</li>
</ul>

<p>Wouldn't encoding the ampersand into &amp; make it part of my parameter's value?
I need it to seperate the second variable from the first</p>

<p>Indeed, by encoding my href value, I do get rid of the errors. What I'm wondering now however is what to do if for example my colorId would be ""123&amp;456"", where the ampersand is part of the value.
Since the separator has to be encoded, what to do with encoded ampersands. Do they need to be encoded twice so to speak?</p>

<p>So to get the url:  </p>

<p><code>www.mySite.com/search?query=123&amp;amp;456&amp;page=1</code></p>

<p>What should my href value be?</p>

<p>Also, I think I'm about the first person in the world to care about this.. go check the www and count the pages that get their query string validated in the W3C validator..</p>
","9021","nickf","<p>This is a slightly confusing concept to some people, I've found. When you put <code>&amp;amp;</code> in a HTML page, such as in <code>&lt;a href=""abc?def=5&amp;amp;ghi=10""&gt;</code>, the URL is <em>actually</em> <code>abc?def=5&amp;ghi=10</code>. The HTML parser converts the entity to an ampersand.</p>

<p>Think of exactly the same as how you need to escape quotes in a string:</p>

<pre><code>// though you define your string like this:
myString = ""this is \""something\"" you know?""

// the string is ACTUALLY: this is ""something"" you know?

// when you look at the HTML, you see:
&lt;a href=""foo?bar=1&amp;amp;baz=2""&gt;

","9021","nickf","<p>As Shog said, that error will occur when you try to call a method on an object which doesn't have that method.</p>

<p>The solution? You can try the Script Debugger, but I've never found that to be useful myself. The most reliable, yet painfully slow method is alert() debugging. At strategic points through your code, put in an alert with a unique message.

<p>Javascript doesn't have any directive to ""include"" or ""import"" another js file.

","9021","nickf","<p>Ok, a different solution, since it appears Bill is right (read the comments on my other answer).</p>

<p>In the Params tab in the bottom right, you can right click the ""Local Params"" folder and add a new parameter. Give it a name, eg: ""myTest"". Initially it is given a value of NULL. Double click on NULL and type in a new value.</p>

<p>Now you can access it in your query like this:</p>

"<p>Using jQuery, <strong>how do you match elements that are prior to the current element in the DOM tree?</strong> Using <code>prevAll()</code> only matches previous siblings.</p>

","9021","nickf","<p>Ok, here's what I've come up with - hopefully it'll be useful in many different situations. It's 2 extensions to jQuery that I call <code>prevALL</code> and <code>nextALL</code>. While the standard <code>prevAll()</code> matches previous siblings, <code>prevALL()</code> matches ALL previous elements all the way up the DOM tree, similarly for <code>nextAll()</code> and <code>nextALL()</code>.</p>

<p>I'll try to explain it in the comments below:</p>

<pre><code>// this is a small helper extension i stole from
// http://www.texotela.co.uk/code/jquery/reverse/
// it merely reverses the order of a jQuery set.
$.fn.reverse = function() {
    return this.pushStack(this.get().reverse(), arguments);
};

// create two new functions: prevALL and nextALL. they're very similar, hence this style.
$.each( ['prev', 'next'], function(unusedIndex, name) {
    $.fn[ name + 'ALL' ] = function(matchExpr) {
        // get all the elements in the body, including the body.
        var $all = $('body').find('*').andSelf();

        // slice the $all object according to which way we're looking
        $all = (name == 'prev')
             ? $all.slice(0, $all.index(this)).reverse()
             : $all.slice($all.index(this) + 1)
        ;
        // filter the matches if specified
        if (matchExpr) $all = $all.filter(matchExpr);
        return $all;
    };
});

<p>usage:</p>

"<p>We need to see what methods/fields an object has in Javascript.</p>
","9021","nickf","<p>As the others said, you can use Firebug, and that will sort you out no worries on Firefox. Chrome &amp; Safari both have a built-in developer console which has an almost identical interface to Firebug's console, so your code should be portable across those browsers. For other browsers, there's <a href=""http://getfirebug.com/lite.html"">Firebug Lite</a>.</p>

<p>If Firebug isn't an option for you, then try this simple script:</p>

    for (var i in obj) {
        out += i + "": "" + obj[i] + ""\n"";

"<p>I have this code</p>

<pre><code>while($row = mysql_fetch_row($result))

foreach($row as $key =&gt; $value)
{
echo '&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=""#"" onclick=""GetAuctionData(\''.$pk.'\')""&gt;' . $value . '&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;';
}
</code></pre>

<p>which gets pk. pk is then passed on to the axjax part with this:</p>

<pre><code>function GetAuctionData(pk)
{
.....
var url=""get_auction.php?""
url=url+""cmd=GetAuctionData&amp;pk=""+pk;
</code></pre>

<p>And finally used in a separate php file with:</p>

<pre><code>$pk = $_GET[""pk""];
$sql=""SELECT * FROM Auctions WHERE ARTICLE_NO ='$pk'"";
</code></pre>

<p>the second php file works fine when using it by itself and passing parameters. Likewise there are no errors anywhere. The problem seems to be with passing or generating $pk, as the links in the output file result in $pk being incremednted by 2, eg 4, 6, 8 etc</p>

<p>I can not understand why this is happening.</p>
","9021","nickf","<p>The other responses here should answer your problem sufficiently, but I just wanted to add an extra debugging tip to could help you should you run into a similar problem in the future.</p>

<p>You can do some very basic debugging by merely printing to the screen information about the variables you're working with. (A PHP IDE will often have more powerful debugging features, but for something like this problem, this method will be fine)</p>

<p><strong>Your original code:</strong></p>

<pre><code>while($row = mysql_fetch_row($result))
{
    echo '&lt;tr&gt;';
    $pk = $row[0]['ARTICLE_NO'];

    foreach($row as $key =&gt; $value)
    {
        echo '&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=""#"" onclick=""GetAuctionData(\''.$pk.'\')""&gt;' . $value . '&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;';
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>You notice that the GetAuctionData function isn't getting its variable properly. Add this line:</p>

<pre><code>$pk = $row[0]['ARTICLE_NO'];
var_dump($pk);
</code></pre>

<p>If you look at the output when you run the file, you'd probably see it saying that $pk is null. Hmmm, that didn't work. Let's change it a bit:</p>

<pre><code>$pk = $row[0]['ARTICLE_NO'];
var_dump($row);
</code></pre>

<p>You'd now see something like this:</p>

<pre><code>array(2) {
  [0]=&gt; string(2) ""12""
  [1]=&gt; string(7) ""myValue""
}
</code></pre>

<p>Aha! Now that you can see exactly what you're working with, you'd see that the code you wanted to use in the first place was:</p>

<pre><code>$pk = $row[0];
</code></pre>

<p><code>var_dump()</code> is your friend. If you're working with arrays, <code>print_r()</code> gives you similar information, but formatted nicely.</p>

"<p>I've been working a little with DevExpress CodeRush and Refactor! Pro this week, and I picked up a commentor plug-in that will automatically generate comments as you type code.</p>

<p>I don't want to go into how good a job it does of picking out basic meaning (pretty good, actually) but it's default implementation does raise a question.</p>

<p>By default, typing a } character to close a block will result in the plugin adding a comment like the following...</p>

<pre><code>using(MyType myType = new MyType())
{
    myType.doWork();
} // using
</code></pre>

<p>(i.e. adding a comment to the closing brace labelling where it was opened.)</p>

<p>While I can see that there are instances where this behaviour may be of great use, I feel that the resultant code looks very untidy with all the additional commenting.</p>

<p>I was wondering what other people;'s take on this kind of comment was.  Not just from an academic standpoint, but if I get a good number of negative comments about them I can decide whether to inflict them upon my co-workers or strip them out.</p>
","9021","nickf","<p>Sometimes you will get very large code blocks, or a lot of nested blocks closing together. I sometimes use this style in cases like this, but definitely not all the time. I don't restrict it to code either: HTML can benefit greatly from this style of ""close commenting"":</p>

"<p>We are deciding the naming convention for tables, columns, procedures, etc. at our development team at work. The singular-plural table naming <em>has already been decided</em>, we are using singular. We are discussing whether to use a prefix for each table name or not. I would like to read suggestions about using a prefix or not, and why.</p>

<p>Does it provide any security at all (at least one more obstacle for a possible intruder)? I think it's generally more comfortable to name them with a prefix, in case we are using a table's name in the code, so to not confuse them with variables, attributes, etc. But I would like to read opinions from more experienced developers.</p>
","9021","nickf","<p>If you're worried about mixing up your table names, employ a hungarian notation style system in your code. Perhaps ""s"" for string + ""tn"" for table name:</p>

<pre><code> stnUsers = 'users';
 stnPosts = 'posts';
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, the prefix is up to you, depending on how verbose you like your code... <code>strtblUsers, strtblnmeUsers, thisisthenameofatableyouguysUsers...</code></p>

<p>Appending a prefix to table names does have some benefits, especially if you don't hardcode that prefix into the system, and allow it to change per installation. For one, you run less risk of conflicts with other components, as Ian said, and secondly, should you wish, you could have two or instances of your program running off the same database.</p>

<ul>
<li>At home, I have several side projects, most of them quite small, one large, and numerous little examples that demonstrate a specific language feature (for example, some template trick in C++).</li>
<li>Since I think that these examples will be useful to be available when I'm at work for a reference instead of trying to remember the exact details of this or that particular snippet that was tried and worked at home, I want to have it available for example on a USB flash drive.</li>
<li>The problem is that most of the snippets/small programs/examples are organized, written, compiled and tested in Visual Studio, it will be duplication if I have to put them in some code snippet organizer application. I can copy to the flash drive the source of the Visual Studio solution with all the examples, but it is not so convenient for searching compared with a dedicated snippet repository organizer.

<p>Thank you very much, those were great hints! Unfortunately, it still doesn't work...</p>

<p>The problem is that IE shows the content of both containers until the animation is over... Firefox behaves correctly... I thought it's the thing with ""overflow: hidden"" - but that didn't change anything.</p>

<p>I already tried the accordion-plugin, but it behaves exactly the same...</p>
","9021","nickf","<p>I'm not sure what the problem is exactly... perhaps you can't animate to ""<code>display: none</code>"" ? Try this:</p>

"<p>Wondering the most efficent way to make a binary search tree into a spell checker by reading in say 1000 word dictionary file and then having it check another document that say has a couple paragraphs. </p>
","9021","nickf","<p>If you're just trying to see if a particular word exists in your dictionary (that is, it's spelt correctly), then I don't think a binary search tree is what you're after. A better way to store that information would be in a tree style where each successive node on your tree is one character, and reading the path to the end node gives you the spelling of that word. You'd also need to add a marker to indicate a word-ending.</p>

<p>Eg: say your dictionary has these words: car, cart, cat, cup, cut</p>

<pre><code>- C
  - A
    - R
      - end
      - T
    - T
      - end
  - U
    - P
      - end
    - T
      - end
</code></pre>

<p>Checking if a word exists is a matter of looking at each letter individually, and that it exists in the children of the current node.</p>

<pre><code>Check for ""cat""
Does ""C"" exist at the root level? Yes, move to the next letter.
Does ""A"" exist underneath C? Yes, move on.
Does ""T"" exist underneath A? Yes, move on.
Is there a word ending after the T? Yes. Word exists.

Check for ""cu""
Does ""C"" exist at the root level? Yes, move to the next letter.
Does ""U"" exist at the root level? Yes, move to the next letter.
Is there a word ending after the U? No. Word does not exist.

<p>How you store this information is up to you. As Steven pointed out, a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ternary_search_trie"" rel=""nofollow"">Ternary Search Trie</a> might be the way to go: each node would have 27 possible child nodes.</p>

"<p>I am setting up a very small MySQL database that stores, first name, last name, email and phone number and am struggling to find the 'perfect' datatype for each field. I know there is no such thing as a perfect answer, but there must be some sort of common convention for commonly used fields such as these.

","9021","nickf","<p>Since you're going to be dealing with data of a variable length (names, email addresses), then you'd be wanting to use VARCHAR. The amount of space taken up by a VARCHAR field is <code>[field length]</code> + 1 bytes, up to max length 255, so I wouldn't worry too much about trying to find a perfect size. Take a look at what you'd imagine might be the longest length might be, then double it and set that as your VARCHAR limit. That said...:</p>

<p>I generally set email fields to be VARCHAR(100) - i haven't come up with a problem from that yet. Names I set to VARCHAR(50).</p>

<p>As the others have said, phone numbers and zip/postal codes are not actually numeric values, they're strings containing the digits 0-9 (and sometimes more!), and therefore you should treat them as a string. VARCHAR(20) should be well sufficient.</p>

<p>Note that if you were to store phone numbers as integers, many systems will assume that a number starting with 0 is an octal (base 8) number! Therefore, the perfectly valid phone number ""0731602412"" would get put into your database as the decimal number ""124192010""!!</p>

<p>I'm using mooTools (where the Class object comes from) if you think that matters.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I simplified it for posting the example, but the x.bar() is part of a click event for another method.

It's actually a .axd file being send with the text/javascript contenttype, so I'm not sure why - I'll have to investigate tommorrow.  </p>

<p>And yes, the tags will be at the bottom.  file1 is an annoying large javascript file, which is why it's separated out - the goal is to have to cached on the client as much as humanly possible.  It's an .axd file because it generated from the database (Ref data) and I set the expires, compression, contenttype, and cachability explicitly.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> After more fiddling, I figured out there was an error in the data generated that firebug wasn't catching; and this was just a bug, not some deep technical problem.  As such; closing.</p>
","9021","nickf","<p>It may just be the order in which the files are being executed. The browser will run the files in the order they load, not necessarily in the order they were included. A simple way to test if this is the case is to add a line of debugging to each file.</p>

","9021","nickf","<p>So each image has a number of tags (eg: ""apple"", ""red"", ""big""), and when you mouse over the big red apple, you want all other apples, big things and red things to light up?</p>

    .each(function() {
        var thisClasses = this.className.split(/s+/); // array of classes.
        var search = [];
        for (var i = 0; i &lt; thisClasses.length; ++i) {

<p>What this does is initially loop through all your tagged images and work out what the tags are on each of them, storing that into that element's data(). This means we only need to do that once, and not each time.</p>

<p>Then it adds a <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Events/hover"" rel=""nofollow"">hover</a> event to each tagged image to find anything which matches any of this image's tags and add the ""highlight"" class. Similarly it removes the class when you mouseout.</p>

<p>It will only hit the second command and not close them all first.  Any suggestions?</p>
","9021","nickf","<p>I'm not exactly sure what you're after, but this is my best guess. Out of all your accordions, you want the ""open all"" button to open all the accordions which are closed (that is, no section is showing). I'd do that by using <code>filter()</code></p>

<pre><code>$(""#contact, #address, #email, #sales, #equipment, #notes, #marketingdata"")
    .filter("":not(:has(.selected))"")
    .accordion(""activate"", 0)
;
</code></pre>

<p>Is that what you were after?</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>Edit to explain that filter function:</p>

<p>The filter function just runs your current selection through a filter, removing anything which doesn't match. It has two different forms: one where you pass a regular jQuery query in, like i did above, and the other where you can define a function to filter. If the function returns false, then that element is removed.</p>

<p>In this case the query removes anything which doesn't (<code>:not</code>) have (<code>:has</code>) a child with class ""selected"" (<code>.selected</code>). I used the <code>.selected</code> selector here because that's what the accordion adds to the currently-open panel.</p>

<p>If you only had one accordion, or you gave each of your accordions some sort of identifier, such as a class name, then you could greatly reduce the entire script. Let's say that for each element you want to turn into an accordion, you give it the class ""accord"".</p>

<pre><code>$("".accord:not(:has(.selected))"").accordion(""activate"", 0);
</code></pre>

<p>This is much more legible and maintainable, since you can easily add more accordions in the future if you wish and this will handle it.</p>

","9021","nickf","<p><a href=""#382600"" rel=""nofollow"">OIS's answer</a> is really good, though I could see that it might get confusing if the object suddenly changes to something else. That is, you'd expect that at the end of your chain, you'll end up with the same object. To avoid that problem, I'd add a private variable to tell the class whether or not to actually do anything. If the class has been stopped, then every class just returns <code>$this</code> straight away. This gives you the added benefit of being able to restart the execution.</p>

<pre><code>class MyClass {
    private $halt;

    function __call($func, $args) {
        if ($this-&gt;halt) {

"<p>A lot of times when reading about web developping on the internet I hear that you should split up your javascript and css files into multiple files.<br />
Like split up your css files in a:</p>

<ul>
<li>clear.css</li>
<li>base.css</li>
<li>page_specific.css</li>
</ul>

<p>Or that you should even split those up into files containing positioning, colour and typography information.</p>

<p>But isn't it true that a browser is only allowed to make two simultaneous http requests? Splitting the files up into that many would create a whole load of http requests. Isn't it better to just split them into two files, a page specific and and a base/clear css file? and then send them with loads of cache headers? </p>

<p>I understand that splitting up the files is easier for development but shouldn't speed be more important?</p>
","9021","nickf","<p>Why not have the best of both worlds?</p>

<p>What I do with my projects is keep multiple CSS and JS files in a <code>src</code> directory and then have a script to combine them together and compress (pack) each one into a ""myproject.pack.js"" or ""myproject.pack.css"" file. Creating a shortcut to run this script in <a href=""http://www.ultraedit.com"" rel=""nofollow"">my IDE</a> makes this entirely painless and gives you the benefits of having heavily commented and logically separated JS and CSS files, combined with the benefits of single HTTP requests and minimised code.</p>

","9021","nickf","<blockquote>

<p>If you don't delete the sub-directories then you can't delete the parent directory (since it must be empty first). If you build your delete_directory function such that it will only sometimes delete a directory, then you're asking for problems down the track.</p>

<p>If you need to delete all the files in a directory and its sub-directories, then I'd create a function for that, call it <code>deleteDirectoryFiles()</code> or something. The <code>deleteDirectory</code> function could then call that, and then just clean up the empty directories.</p>

"<p>I've got a very strange bug cropping up in some PHP code I've got. The page is managing student enrolments in courses. On the page is a table of the student's courses, and each row has a number of dates: when they enrolled, when they completed, when they passed the assessment and when they picked up their certificate.</p>

<p>The table data is generated by PHP (drawing the data from the DB), and Javascript actually renders the table. The output from PHP is JS code which looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>var e = new Enrolment();
e.contactId = 5801;
e.enrolId = 14834;
e.courseId = 3;
e.dateEnrolled = new Date(1219672800000);
e.dateCompleted = new Date(-1000);  // magic value meaning they haven't completed.
e.resultDate = new Date(1223647200000);
e.certDate = new Date(1223560800000);
e.result = 95;
e.passed = true;
enrolments[14834] = e;
</code></pre>

<p>In the database, all the date fields are stored as <code>DATE</code> (not <code>DATETIME</code>) fields.</p>

<p>The bug is that the dates are being displayed as one day off. I would suspect that this has a lot to do with the server being in an area which has daylight saving, whereas here there isn't any (meaning the server time is one hour off). This explains a lot, especially how the data preparation and rendering is being done in two different timezones. That is: the server is saying to the client that the person completed at midnight on the 15th August, and the client is interpreting that as 11pm on the 14th and therefore displaying 14th August.</p>

<p>But here's the confusing part: it's only doing that for the resultDate and certDate fields! I've copied the data to my local server and have found that the production server is actually sending a different timestamp (one which is off by 1 hour) just for those two fields, whereas the dateEnrolled field is the same.</p>

<p>Here's the output using the exact same code and data from the database:</p>

<pre><code>// local server (timezone GMT+1000)
e.dateEnrolled = new Date(1219672800000);   // 26 Aug 2008 00:00 +10:00
e.dateCompleted = new Date(-1000);
e.resultDate = new Date(1223647200000);     // 11 Oct 2008 00:00 +10:00
e.certDate = new Date(1223560800000);       // 10 Oct 2008 00:00 +10:00

// production server (timezone GMT+1100)
e.dateEnrolled = new Date(1219672800000);   // 26 Aug 2008 00:00 +10:00
e.dateCompleted = new Date(-1000);
e.resultDate = new Date(1223643600000);     // 10 Oct 2008 23:00 +10:00 **
e.certDate = new Date(1223557200000);       // 09 Oct 2008 23:00 +10:00 **
</code></pre>

<p>I can understand if this was a problem with Daylight Saving not being accounted for, but notice how the dateEnrolled is the same?</p>

<p>The PHP code which converts the MySQL date to a unix timestamp is this: </p>

<pre><code>list ($year, $month, $day) = explode ('-', $mysqlDT);
$timestamp = mktime (0,0,0, $month, $day, $year);
</code></pre>

<p>Any ideas about how to fix this?</p>

At first I was appalled, but then I thought, ""why not? We'll <strong>never</strong> be hosted in a subdirectory.""

"<p>I've recently bumped into facelift, an alternative to sIFR and I was wondering if those who have experience with both sIFR and FLIR could shed some light on their experience with FLIR.</p>

<p>For those of you who've not yet read about how FLIR does it, FLIR works by taking the text from targeted elements using JavaScript to then make calls to a PHP app that uses PHP's GD to render and return transparent PNG images that get placed as background for the said element, where the overflow is then set to hidden and padding is applied equal to the elements dimensions to effectively push the text out of view.</p>

<p>This is what I've figured so far:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The good</p>

<ul>
<li>No flash (+for mobiles)</li>
<li>FLIR won't break the layout</li>
<li>Images range from some 1KB (say one h3 sentence) to 8KB (very very large headline)</li>
<li>Good documentation</li>
<li>Easy to implement</li>
<li>Customizable selectors</li>
<li>Support for jQuery/prototype/scriptaculous/mooTools</li>
<li>FLIR has implemented cache</li>
<li>Browsers cache the images themselves!</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The bad</p>

<ul>
<li>Text can't be selected</li>
<li>Requests are processed from all sources (you need to restrict FLIR yourself to process requests from your domain only)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>My main concerns are about how well does it scale, that is, how expensive is it to work with the GD library on a shared host, does anyone have experience with it?; second, what love do search engines garner for sIFR or FLIR implementations knowing that a) text isn't explicitly hidden b) renders only on a JavaScript engine.</p>
","9021","nickf","<p>I know that with sIFR, and I assume with FLIR that you perform your markup in the same way as usual, but with an extra class tag or similar, so it can find the text to replace. Search engines will still read the markup as regular text so that shouldn't be an issue.</p>

<p>Performance-wise: if you're just using this for headings (and they're not headings which will change each page load), then the caching of the images in browsers, and also presumably on the server's disk should remove any worries about performance.

<li>Using <code>$('form.myForm')</code> 10000 times took 1.367s</li>

"<p>I have a data object with three fields, A, B and C. The problem is that the user can set any of them because:</p>

<p>A * B = C</p>

<p>So if a user starts off by setting A &amp; B, C will be calculated.  but then if a user set C, A gets recalculated, so there is an implicit anchoring that is happening based off the last field that the user set.</p>

<p>i want to avoid a solution with a lot of flag member variables.  Any best practices on how i can code this class up without having a lot of stuff  like this below</p>

<pre><code>public class Object
{
     private double _A;
     private double _B;
     private double _C;

     private bool _enteredA;
     private bool _enteredB;
     private bool _enteredC;

public double A
{
get
    {
     if (_enteredC)
     {
          return _C / _B;
     }
     else
     {
        return _A;
     }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>should the logic of setting A, B, and C always be on the ""get"" or the ""set"".</p>

<p>Is there any cleaner way to doing this?</p>
","9021","nickf","<p>So your rules are:</p>

<pre><code>A = C / B
B = C / A
C = A * B
</code></pre>

<p>What you'd need to do is remember the last <strong>two</strong> fields that the user entered, and from that, calculate the third. Therefore if they entered A and then B, then you calculate C. If they then change C, then recalculate A, and so on.</p>

<p>If you want to code it without using boolean flags, there's a couple of different ways you could do that. A queue, or just a simple array/map would work:</p>

<pre><code>editOrder = {A : 0, B : 0, C : 0 }  // (or just use 0, 1, 2)
editCount = 0;

every time any field is edited :
    editCount = editCount + 1
    editOrder[field] = editCount
    if two fields have an editOrder &gt; 0
        recalculate the field with the lowest editOrder
</code></pre>

<p>Example usage:</p>

<pre><code>Field changed    editOrder        recalculate field
    A            1,0,0            -
    A            2,0,0            -
    B            2,3,0            C
    C            2,3,4            A

"<p>I've developed a system in my application where emails are picked up with a regex, and then reversed in the source (to thwart bots). I then add the span class 'obfuscate email'.

<p>If you wanted to stick to using the RTL CSS method, you could try playing around with the unicode character to reverse text: \u202E I'm not sure if that will help, but it's worth looking at</p>

 - Scripts placed before the parsing error still run. (Of course.)

"<p>What are some of techniques good for detecting if a webpage is the same as another?  </p>

<p>By same, I don't mean char-for-char equivalent (that's easy), but is robust enough to ignore something like a current date/time on the page, etc. </p>

<p>E.g., go a Yahoo! News article load the page, open the same page 10 minutes later in another browser.  Baring rewrites, those pages will have some differences (timestamps, possibly things like ads, possibly things like related stories), but a human could look at the two and say they're the same.</p>

<p>Note I'm not trying to fix (or rely) on URL normalization.  I.e., figuring out that foo.html &amp; foo.html?bar=bang are the same.</p>
","9021","nickf","<p>Without intimate knowledge of the structure of the pages you're trying to compare, then this could be very tricky. That is, how is a machine supposed to tell that a page with a couple of different pictures is the same - if it's a news site with ads then it should be the same, but if it's a photographer's portfolio, then it's definitely different.</p>

<p>If you do know the structure of the page, then what I'd do is manually select portions of the page (using IDs, CSS selectors, XPath, etc) to compare. For example, only compare the <code>#content</code> divs between page refreshes. From there, you might need to add a tolerance level to a char-by-char comparison.</p>

<p>There's a service which does a similar thing, actually. It's called <a href=""http://www.rsspect.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Rsspect</a> (written by Ryan North of Qwantz fame), which will detect changes to any website and create an RSS feed out of it, even if you don't control the page.</p>

"<p>I have to create a report on some student completions. The students each belong to one client. Here are the tables (simplified for this question).</p>

  `clientName` varchar(100) NOT NULL default '',
  `courseNames` varchar(255) NOT NULL default ''

  `courseId` tinyint(3) unsigned NOT NULL default '0'
)

<p>The <code>courseId</code> field here is <strong>the index of the course name in the clients.courseNames field</strong>. So, if the client's <code>courseNames</code> are ""AB01,AB02,AB03"", and the <code>courseId</code> of the enrolment is <code>2</code>, then the student is in AB03.</p>

<p>Is there a way that I can do a single select on these tables that includes the course name? Keep in mind that there will be students from different clients (and hence have different course names, not all of which are sequential,eg: ""NW01,NW03"")</p>

"<p>The jQuery UI widgets seem to have inactive, active, and hover states, but lack a depressed (clicked-and-held) state. Is this an oversight? Just about every modern UI I can think of have a depressed state. Has anyone added such a state? If so, what pieces of code did you have to touch?</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>Edit: What I should have said is that hovering and clicked look the same. There should be another state so you can see that you've clicked after hovering.</p>
","9021","nickf","<p>Don't forget that in your CSS, you can combine the pseudo-selectors:</p>

<pre><code>a:link {
    color: blue;

<p>There's a definite difference between <code>a:active</code> and <code>a:active:hover</code> : a link can become active by tabbing to it using the keyboard. Though it's not 100% foolproof, the state of being active and hovered would suggest that the user has the link depressed. Altering the border style would give you the desired effect. The only bug in this is if the link becomes active and then the user hovers over it without clicking, it'll still go depressed.</p>

"<p>I'm trying to get my head round this mind boggling stuff they call Database Design without much success, so I'll try to illustrate my problem with an example.</p>

<li>Actors</li>
<li>Running Time</li>

<li>Description</li>
<li>Year</li>
<li>Director</li>

<p><strong>Films Table => filmid, filmtitle, runningtime, description</strong></p>

<p><strong>Year Table => year</strong></p>

<p><strong>Genre Table => genre</strong></p>

<p><strong>Director Table => director</strong></p>

<p><strong>Actors Table => actor_name</strong></p>

<p>But, how would I go about creating relationships between these tables?</p>

<p>Also, I have created a unique ID for the Films Table with a primary key that automatically increments, do I need to create a unique ID for each table?</p>

<p>And finally if I were to update a new film into the database through a PHP form, how would I insert all of this data in (with the relationships and all?)</p>

<li>I'm building a public website where I need to display video.</li>
<li>I need to control what the player looks like</li>
<li>I'm the sole publisher of the video, meaning it can't be on YouTube for example</li>
<li>I need as much protection as possible in terms of protecting the content from being downloaded</li>
</ol>

<p>So, I've read around StackOverflow and the web, and found lots of suggestions, like numerous flash players, Streaming servers, DRM protocols, services like Panda etc etc.</p>

<p>The problem is I don't understand how everything fits together.</p>

<p>For example, what makes my video content secure?
Is it the player on the client? is it the server that hosts the content? is it the streaming process? who hosts the streaming servers and what difference does this make?</p>

<p>Bearing in mind this is otherwise a very simple site, and is not a business venture. </p>

<p>if you were working around my requirements, what would you do? Could you explain step by step at a high level?</p>

Just based on a couple of answers, I'm not saying no one can ever download my content. And I realize this kind of thing is expensive.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>
Thanks again for all the feedback, I can't vote anyone up as I'm a new user, but your answers have been very helpful.</p>

<p>The one thing I will say, is that my only request was to attempt security, that is 'make it difficult' for most users...that is common in software security.</p>

<p>Some of the suggestions have been just to not even try.</p>

<p>My question was really based around the fact that I know nothing about video deployment on the web, apart form the basic embedded swf flv combo.</p>

<p>Anyway, your info has been very useful though. I'll try a simple ""real"" streaming service (as opposed to HTTP streaming).</p>

<p>Any other recommendations would be awesome</p>

","9021","nickf","<p>Before you go too far worrying about setting up these secure streaming protocol client server whatevers, make sure you weigh up the cost of your time getting this going, versus the cost of someone downloading your video.</p>

<p><em>Response to your comment:</em></p>

<p>What I'd probably try doing if you wanted to try to avoid users downloading the files is this (I'll assume you're using FLV files, since they're the de facto standard on the web these days):</p>

<ul>
<li>Put the FLV files in a non web-accessible directory.</li>
<li>Have a <code>player.swf</code> file request the file via a script on your site, eg: <code>video.php?file=myVideo.flv</code></li>
<li>The <code>video.php</code> can then perform whatever security checks you'd like: for example, require logins, check the referrer, etc.</li>
<li>If the security checks are ok, then pass through the appropriate video file. If not, then perhaps have a short back-up video which is an ad for your site or something, saying ""to watch this video, please come to mysite.com!""</li>

<p>Any other good practices to cover not set variables and assert an array?</p>
","9021","","<p>There's quite a few times that you'd like to write a function to take one or more values for a parameter:</p>

<pre><code>function getNamesById($id) { }
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, it would make sense that if this function was called with an array of ids, it should probably return an array of names. Similarly, to save the calling code from having to wrap the input in an array and then unwrap the output, if you just pass a scalar, then a scalar should be returned. Consider the likely contents of the function designed to handle both scalar and array parameters:</p>

<pre><code>function getNamesById($id) {
    $returnAnArray = is_array($id);
    $output = array();
    foreach ((array)$id as $theId) {
        // perform some logic
        $output[] = someFunction($theId);
    }
    return $returnAnArray ? $output : $output[0];
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can see that in this case, casting to an array definitely makes things a lot easier for everyone. As they say, be liberal in what you accept... As long as it is documented that it is <em>expected</em> that a variable could be either, then I see no problem. PHP is a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck%5FTyping"" rel=""nofollow"">duck-typed</a> language, which has both benefits and drawbacks, but this is one of the benefits, so enjoy it!</p>

"<p>I've been asked to develop an information and e-learning website with an emphasis on community aspects that will also encompass a lot of other areas. There is a tight budget to this project, so I'm looking to use off the shelf products where possible - but I need to make sure I pick the best possible platform to begin with. </p>

<p>I am a php developer with extensive database knowledge, so I'm envisioning a degree of active development.</p>

<p>The main requirements are:</p>

<ul>
<li>User Contribution / Community Building</li>
<li>General Content</li>
<li>E-learning  </li>
<li>Forums</li>
<li>Blogs</li>
<li>Articles</li>
<li>eCommerce</li>
<li>Listings Directory</li>
<li>Wikis</li>
</ul>

<p>Future areas that have been discussed by the organisation include social networking, so there is a definite emphasis on the community and user contributory aspects.</p>

<p>I know that Moodle is regarded as a leader when it comes to developing e-learning solutions, but I'm fearful it will fall short in the many other areas that the site requires (I'm aware there are plugins / modules available for Moodle, but I'm not sure if generally there is enough development in these areas).</p>

<p>A solution which looks promising to me is <a href=""http://www.jfusion.org"" rel=""nofollow"">JFusion</a>, which is an open-source bridge to combine several different systems (in terms of structure and user authentication) - this is built around Joomla, but supports Moodle and several forum software products, along with Magento eCommerce. This would also open up the massive world of Joomla extensions, which I think would cover all the requirements above.</p>

<p>So, to summarise, <strong>my question is - should I try to stick within the confines of Moodle, or should I look to other solutions to cover all angles?</strong> </p>

<p>I'd be very interested to hear from developers who've used both platforms - or perhaps know of more suitable platforms on which to base things.</p>
","9021","nickf","<p>At <a href=""http://www.health-e-learning.com"" rel=""nofollow"">my company</a>, I've been able to achieve a little of what you've described, I believe. We run our company homepage with marketing, enrolments and community (read: a forum) on Joomla 1.5, and this has been linked to our Moodle site for the courseware. A slightly modified Moodle authentication ""external db"" plugin lets users have a single sign-on between the two sites.</p>

<p>Though it looks as though Moodle has been pushing towards being a bit of a ""portal"" solution (being able to cover generic homepage and community functionality as well as courseware), it seems a little underdone and clunky currently. Joomla 1.5 has been a big step forward and the much more active plugin community of Joomla will serve you well.</p>

<li>What's the best way to size text across browsers?</li>
<li>What are the advantages and disadvantages of defining font size in pixels / em?</li>
</ul>
","9021","nickf","<p>Personally I set an absolute font size on the <code>body</code> and from there set everything as relative to that. eg: </p>

<pre><code>body {
    font-size: 10px;    /* or pt if you want */
}
h1 {
    font-size: 200%;

p {

}
div {
    font-size: 150%;

/* what size is a ""div &gt; p"" ? */

<p>All the modern browsers have full-page zoom these days, meaning that even sizing your font in pixels is ok.</p>

<p>The benefit to this method is that you can easily size up or down all your text by changing one definition.</p>

Because the content of all the controlls can varry greatly in length, I cannot give any element any width specifications (not even in %). Also, over estimating the width would leave confusing white spaces between elements. This too is not a desired effect.</p>
","9021","nickf","<p>Unless you change its display property (and you shouldn't), the <code>span</code> element should be an inline element, meaning that it exists in the flow of text. Putting block level elements inside an inline element isn't really a good idea.</p>

<p>The <code>span</code> does nothing, and the <code>em</code> can be emulated through CSS:</p>

.fancySubmitButton, .fancyLinkButton {

}
.fancyLinkButton {
    display: block;  /* this will put it on its own line */
}
</code></pre>

<p>Quick response to the comments: giving something the class ""fancyLinkButton"" <em>doesn't</em> imply that it has rounded corners. Anyway, if you want to put rounded corners on certain elements, I would still avoid using extraneous markup. If more wrapper elements are needed for whatever implementation you're using, then those should be added via Javascript. Remember that mozilla and webkit already support CSS rounded corners - eventually IE will too, and you'll be able to easily change your single javascript function, rather than wading through HTML to find everywhere where there are unneeded spans.</p>

<ul>
<li>Break zipcode into 2 parts, first 2 digits and last 3 digits.</li>
<li>Make a giant if-else statement first checking the first 2 digits, then checking ranges within the last 3 digits.</li>
<li>Or, covert the zips into hex, and see if I can do the same thing using smaller groups.</li>
<li>Find out if within the range of all valid zip codes there are more valid zip codes vs invalid zip codes. Write the above code targeting the smaller group.</li>
<li>Break up the hash into separate files, and load them via Ajax as user types in the zipcode. So perhaps break into 2 parts, first for first 2 digits, second for last 3. </li>

"<p>I'm writing PHP code to parse a string. It needs to be as fast as possible, so are regular expressions the way to go? I have a hunch that PHP string functions are more expensive, but it's just a guess. What's the truth?</p>

<p>Here's specifically what I need to do with the string:</p>

<p>Grab the first half (based on the third location of a substring ""000000"") and compare its hash to the next 20 bytes, throwing away anything left.</p>

<p>Parse the 9th byte through the next ""000000"" as one piece of data. Then grab the next 19 bytes after that, and split that into 8 (toss 1) and 8. Then I do some other stuff that converts those two 8 byte strings into dates.</p>

","9021","nickf","<p>It depends on your case: if you're trying to do something fairly basic (eg: search for a string, replace a substring with something else), then the regular string functions are the way to go.

<p>I haven't profiled regexes so I can't say that they'll be faster at runtime, but I can tell you that the extra time spent hacking together the equivalent using the basic functions wouldn't be worth it.</p>

<p>It sounds as though you actually need to do a number of small string operations here. Since each one individually is quite basic, and I doubt you'd be able to do all those steps (or even a couple of those steps) at one time using a regex, I'd go with the basic functions:</p>

<blockquote>

"<p>How can you edit Joomla's articles in terminal?</p>

<p><strong>Problem:</strong> to know the location where Joomla stores its articles</p>

<p>I tried to find articles unsuccessfully by</p>

<pre><code>locate Masi | xargs -0 grep great
</code></pre>
","9021","nickf","<p>The articles are stored in the database in a table called <code>jos_content</code>. If you wanted to do a find and replace across them all, open a connection to the database (or use something like phpMyAdmin) and run something like this:</p>

<pre><code> UPDATE `jos_content`
 SET    `introtext` = REPLACE(`introtext`, 'great', 'awesome'),
        `fulltext`  = REPLACE(`fulltext`, 'great', 'awesome')
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Edit</strong> to help you debug the problem:<br />
You won't be able to find ""jos_content"" in your codebase, because of a feature of Joomla which allows you to specify different table prefixes: ""jos"" is the default prefix. In the code, it's always written like this: <code>#__content</code>, and the DBO object converts that to ""<code>jos_content</code>"" behind the scenes.</p>

<p>However, you don't need to be looking in your code at all, just the database. You should be able to connect to the database - all the details you need will be in your <code>configuration.php</code> file.</p>

<ul>
<li>If you're using Joomla 1.5, the variables you need are called <code>$host</code>, <code>$user</code>, <code>$password</code> and <code>$db</code>.  </li>
<li>In Joomla 1.0, the variables are named <code>$mosConfig_host</code>, <code>$mosConfig_user</code>, <code>$mosConfig_password</code> and <code>$mosConfig_db</code></li>
</ul>

<p>There are a number of ways that you can connect to the database (check with your hosting company if you have phpMyAdmin available: it's quite easy to use), but to do it from the terminal (substitute in your own variables from above):</p>

<pre><code>$ mysql -h $host -u $user -p$password -D $db

"<p>I'm kind of new to JavaScript and jQuery and now I'm facing a problem:</p>

<p>I need to post some data to PHP and one bit of the data needs to be the background color hex of div X.</p>

"<p>I just read codes of a web product that is supposed to support multiple modern browser(including FireFox 3.X, Safari 3.X and IE7+, but not including IE6-).

<pre><code>   &lt;div&gt;
         &lt;div&gt;
              &lt;div style=""float:left"" id=""header1""&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;

<p>And then to find all your todos:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT description FROM todo WHERE isDone = 0;

<p>You could continually add new features to it, like dates, categories, urgency levels, tasks and subtasks (eg: Make Breakfast could have subtasks of ""Buy milk"", ""Toast bread"" ...), etc etc. Just choose what's appropriate for your needs. In any case, MySQL will have you covered.</p>

<p>My one thought is to just put a bool setting in a global file (such as the settings file) for whether or not the site is unavailable. True is available, while false is unavailable. When false, the next time the user attempts to access the site they will either be logged out or just presented with an unavailable message.</p>

<p>There are 2 issues I can see with this method:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If users are just finishing filling in a long form or writing a large portion of text (like a new question or answer on SO), as soon as they submit the form, they'd lose that information. (Can't always save it, because there maybe DB changes for that table or code may have changed already.)</p></li>
<li><p>Possible: On a busy site, editing the global file if it's more than a couple lines it might cause PHP parse errors if that page is loaded while it's partially uploaded or while saving. There might also be locking issues on the file, depending on the configuration.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Another option is to have a field in the database with the same setting. At the moment, I don't generally have a table for settings, so this would be the only thing in the table, but I could see it being faster as it avoids the second problem.</p>

<p>Is there something that you've used that worked well or any other ideas?</p>

<p>I'm working with LAMP.</p>
","9021","nickf","<p>This one is similar to <a href=""#664526"" rel=""nofollow"">Bobby's suggestion</a>. The way I achieved the same sort of thing is to put a couple of values in to a ""config"" table in the database, one is the date/time to take the system down, and the other is a message.</p>

<p>Once the date field is not null, then block all logins, and on every page refresh, just use a javascript alert to display the message to users explaining that the site will be taken down in X minutes, for Y reason and should be back online in Z minutes. This is an annoying and in-your-face way to do it, but it's really quite important that they realise that they shouldn't start filling in a really long form.</p>

<p>Once it's after that maintenance start time, then boot all users on their next page refresh. ...except for admins, of course.</p>

<p>Getting all the clients to periodically poll the server to check for an impending maintenance period is overkill, IMO. If you do have a couple of pages which have really long forms, then perhaps add the AJAX polling just on those ones.</p>

<p>Having these sort of values in the database is easy to implement, is quite flexible, and is perfect for this situation.</p>

"<p>I need suggestions about a setup CD layout for non technical users.</p>

<p>My software is deployed on a CD with a setup.exe bootstrapper and a MSI file. There are also several dependency files used by the installer. The CD root looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>myapp.msi
setup.exe
sqlexpr32.exe
dotnetfx.exe
myapp.ico
...
</code></pre>

<p>It is not rocket science for a developer guessing that the file you need to run in order to begin the installation is <code>setup.exe</code>.</p>

<p>But my users are definitely not as tech-savvy.</p>

<p>I have included an <code>autorun.inf</code> file, but I have found after testing in several machines that most of them do not automatically launch the setup. For whatever reason. In some machines somebody has disabled autorun, or some antivirus software, or whatever. The thing is that I cannot rely on autorun being available at all times.</p>

<p>So I'm thinking making changes to the CD layout in order to make more obvious which file has to be run.</p>

<p>One option is to make a new <code>Install.exe</code> program that just launches the original bootstrapper, and moving everything to a folder in the root of the CD:</p>

<pre><code>autorun.inf   &lt;-- launches Install.exe, if autorun is enabled for the drive.
Install.exe   &lt;-- launches contents/setup.exe
contents/myapp.msi
contents/setup.exe
contents/sqlexpr32.exe
contents/dotnetfx.exe
contents/myapp.ico
contents/...
</code></pre>

<p>As I cannot yet rely on the .net framework being present, I cannot use .net to make my Install.exe and that is kind of annoying.</p>

<p>Other option is making a <code>Install.bat</code> but most users are not familiar with the .bat extension and might not think about double-clicking it. And the user would see a command prompt window.</p>

<p>Other option is making a self-extracting exe and compressing everything inside, so the only files in the CD would be the autorun.inf and the self-extracting file.</p>

<pre><code>function myFunc(array $args) {

<p>There's a couple of reasons for this. Looking at that function, you can quite clearly see that I'm referring to one of the arguments passed into the function. If you extract them, and don't notice the <code>extract()</code> you (or the next guy) will be there scratching your head wondering where this ""<code>$name</code>"" variable came from. Even if you <em>do</em> know you're extracting the arguments to local variables, it's still a guessing game to a certain degree.</p>

<p>Secondly, it ensures that other code doesn't overwrite the args. You may have written your function expecting only to have arguments named <code>$foo</code> and <code>$bar</code>, so in your other code, you define <code>$baz = 8;</code>, for example. Later on, you might want to expand your function to take a new parameter called ""baz"" but forget to change your other variables, so no matter what gets passed in the arguments, <code>$baz</code> will always be set to 8.</p>

<p>There are some benefits to using the array too (these apply equally to the methods of extracting or leaving in the array): you can set up a variable at the top of each function called <code>$defaults</code>:</p>

<pre><code>function myFunc (array $args) {
    $default = array(
        ""name"" =&gt; ""John Doe"",
        ""age"" =&gt; ""30""
    );
    // overwrite all the defaults with the arguments
    $args = array_merge($defaults, $args);
    // you *could* extract($args) here if you want

    echo ""Name: "" . $args['name'] . "", Age: "" . $args['age'];
}

myFunc(array(""age"" =&gt; 25)); // ""Name: John Doe, Age: 25""
</code></pre>

<p>You could even remove all items from <code>$args</code> which don't have a corresponding <code>$default</code> value. This way you know exactly which variables you have.</p>

<p>You can do this by just opening your <code>&lt;backup&gt;.sql</code> file in any text editor, it's just plain text. Sometimes a backup might be a <code>.gz</code> or <code>.bz</code> file, but they're just zips: if you decompress these gzipped or bzipped files, you'll end up with a single <code>.sql</code> file which you can edit easy.</p>

<p>It probably wouldn't be too hard to write a script to split each statement after an arbitrary number of lines. The basic program logic would look like this, perhaps:</p>

<ol>
<li>find a line that starts with ""INSERT"".</li>
<li>copy the line up until the end of the word ""VALUES""</li>
<li>step through all the following lines, counting up as you go.</li>
<li>if your counter reaches 300, then add a semicolon to the end of the last line and paste in the ""INSERT ... VALUES"" statement from before. Reset your counter to 1 and go to step 3.</li>
<li>if you reach a line that starts with ""INSERT"", reset the counter to 1 and go to step 2.</li>
</ol>

<p>Though, you could just do this one manually, and then make sure that all future backups don't use extended inserts. Also, phpMyAdmin lets you set a maximal statement size when creating an export, so it'll do the above for you, basically.</p>

<p>The 'svn update' command aborts at the first project that it cannot retrieve.</p>

<p>Is there a better or standard methodology for svn:externals to allow successful checkouts for all users?</p>

<p>EDIT: I don't have ownership/control on the external projects to grant access, and mirroring the externals is not allowed by company policy.  Because the externals are in support of optional components, users with fewer permissions will obviously not be maintaining the optional components.  However, they will still need to check out other externals, and 'svn up' is very order-dependent.</p>

<p>I realize fixing permissions and splitting into sub-repositories will make this a non-issue, but I am still interested to know if there is any middle ground.</p>

<p>You could perhaps give each user readonly access to all the externals, and write access only to those who need it.</p>

"<p>I have a largish table of data pulled from my database (~1500 rows, each with 10-15 fields) and I'm doing a number of filters and generating some stats and storing these in an excel spreadsheet for the user to download.</p>

<p>Rather than hit the database with the same fairly-complicated query over and over with only minor modifications (to the WHERE and ORDER BY), I'm doing one trip to the DB, putting the results into one big array and then using <code>array_filter</code> and <code>array_multisort</code> to get my new views of the data.</p>

<p>I'm new to <code>array_multisort</code> so I'll post what I've done here for critique.</p>

<pre><code>// an numerical array of associative arrays
$records = $dbResult-&gt;convertToArray();

$fields = $dbResult-&gt;getFieldNames();

// this is run once at the start
$sortArr = array();
foreach ($fields as $field) $sortArr[$field] = array();

foreach ($records as $r) {
    foreach ($r as $key =&gt; $value) {
        $sortArr[$key][] = $value;
    }

// and then to sort:
array_multisort(
    $sortArr['Date Completed'], SORT_DESC,
    $sortArr['Last Name'], SORT_ASC,
    $sortArr['First Name'], SORT_ASC,
    $sortArr['Course'], SORT_ASC,

);

<p>This works fine, though the initial ""copy the entire result into another array"" seems strange to me. The problem occurs when I need to sort the list again. I have the feeling that my <code>$sortArr</code> needs to stay in sync with the <code>$records</code> array, but that it gets broken after each sort.</p>

<p>I'm not even sure that this is the intended use of <code>array_multisort</code>, so I might be way off track here. Can anyone give some advice or tips? How do <em>you</em> sort multidimensional arrays?</p>

"<p>For so long, I've read and understood the following truths concerning web development:</p>

<ol>
<li>HTML is for content</li>
<li>CSS is for presentation</li>
<li>JavaScript is for behavior.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is normally all fine and good, and I find that when I strictly follow these guidelines and use external <code>.css</code> and <code>.js</code> files, it makes my entire site much much more manageable. However, I think I found a situation that breaks this line of thought.</p>

<p>I have a custom forums system that I've built for one of my sites. In addition to the usual formatting for such a system (links, images, bold italics and underline, etc) I've allowed my users to set the formatting of their text, including color, font family, and size. All of this is saved in by database of forum messages as formatting code, and then translated to the corresponding HTML when the page is viewed. (A bit inefficient, technically I should translate before saving, but this way I can work on the system live.)</p>

<p>Due to the nature of this and other similar systems, I end up with a lot of  tags floating around the resulting HTML code, which I believe are unofficially deprecated since I'm supposed to be using CSS for formatting. This breaks rules one and two, which state that HTML should not contain formatting information, preferring that information to be located in the CSS document instead.</p>

<p>Is there a way to achieve dynamic formatting in CSS without including that information in the markup? Is it worth the trouble? Or, considering the implied limitations of proper code, an I to <em>limit what my users can do</em> in order to follow the ""correct"" way to format my code?</p>
","9021","nickf","<p>Consider the benefits versus the costs before you do anything. What is actually wrong with your code right now? Tag soup and combined content/presentation is to be avoided not because it makes a bad website, but because it is hard to maintain. If your HTML/CSS is being generated, who cares what the output is? If what you've got now works, then stick to it.</p>

"<p>I have a chicken-egg problem. I would like too implement a system in PHP in a OOP way, in which two classes would play important roles: Database and Log. My idea was to build up the connection by the Database class, which would have public methods eg. runQuery(sUpdateQuery), doInsert(sInsert), etc. The Log class would writing logs through common methods just as like logMessage(message), logDatabaseQuery(sQuery) TO THE DATABASE. The problem comes now.</p>

<p>1: Inside the methods of the Database's class I would like to be able to use the Log class's logDatabaseQuery(sQuery) </p>

<p>2: This still would not be a big challenge if I would not like to use the Database class's doInsert(sInsert) method inside the logDatabaseQuery method.</p>

<p>I would like to keep it simple - and just use one instance of the database connection object, and from the loggeras well, if it is possible.</p>

<p>For many people Singleton model would be the first idea to choose, but I definitely would like to use different solution.</p>

<p>So there would be two classes which would use each-other's methods:</p>

<p>Database
    doInsert
        logDatabaseQuery</p>

<p>Log
    logDatabaseQuery
       doInsert</p>

<p>I would like to keep the Log methods separately (in the Log class), since later on it would have other methods for logging not just to the database, but to files or e-mails as well.</p>

<p>Alternatively, just check the function stack to see if the insert function was called from the Logging class.</p>

    $callStack = debug_backtrace();
    if (!isset($callStack[1]) || $callStack[1]['class'] !== ""Logger"") {

Having an image suddenly appear at the end could get quite frustrating or distracting, considering that the page takes so long to load that you need to disable the link.

If it finds an element, then push that into the queue. Keep on going until you've either found the word or there's no more elements to search.</p>

"<p>When developing for browsers FF3 and IE6/7 with jQuery, are there any compatibility issues when setting custom attributes on HTML tags?</p>

<p>First, I'm aware of jQuery's <code>data()</code> function and it essentially does what I want, but the data doesn't survive a <code>clone()</code> function.  This is an issue when using the jQuery UI draggable/droppable plugins because it clones DOM elements during a drag/drop.  For the purpose of this question, I need an alternative to <code>data()</code>.</p>

<p>I want to persist data between drag/drop operations.  I want to be able to inject data into the DOM element that is moved during a drag/drop operation.  To do this, I can build HTML child elements to simulate a database record.  Quick experimentation shows that Firefox has no issues utilizing any attribute names I want to store fields of data.  However, the HTML 4 spec says that certain tags can only contain certain attribute names.  Will populating the DOM with nonstandard attributes cause incompatibility issues with the browsers I've mentioned?</p>

  <p>Although it may be tempting to use this as a way to iterate over an Array, this is a bad idea. The for...in statement iterates over user-defined properties in addition to the array elements, so if you modify the array's non-integer or non-positive properties (e.g. by adding a ""foo"" property to it or even by adding a method or property to Array.prototype), the for...in statement will return the name of your user-defined properties in addition to the numeric indexes.</p>

"<p>I've been investigating this issue that only seems to get worse the more I dig deeper.</p>

<p>I started innocently enough trying to use this expression to split a string on HTML 'br' tags:</p>

<pre><code>T = captions.innerHTML.split(/&lt;br.*?&gt;/g);
</code></pre>

<p>This works in every browser (FF, Safari, Chrome), except IE7 and IE8 with example input text like this:</p>

<pre><code>is invariably subjective. &lt;br /&gt; 
The less frequently used warnings (Probably/Possibly) &lt;br /&gt;

<p>Please note that the example text contains a space before the '/', and precedes a new line.</p>

<p>Both of the following will match all HTML tags in every browser:</p>

<pre><code>T = captions.innerHTML.split(/&lt;.*?&gt;/g);
T = captions.innerHTML.split(/&lt;.+?&gt;/g);
</code></pre>

<p>However, surprisingly (to me at least), this <em>does not</em> work in FF and Chrome:</p>

<pre><code>T = captions.innerHTML.split(/&lt;br.+?&gt;/g);
</code></pre>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>This (suggested several times in the responses below,) does not work on IE 7 or 8:</p>

<pre><code>T = captions.innerHTML.split(/&lt;br[^&gt;]*&gt;/g);
</code></pre>

<p>(It did work on Chrome and FF.)</p>

<p>My question is: does anyone know an expression that works in all current browsers to match the 'br' tags above (but not other HTML tags).  And can anyone confirm that the last example above should be a valid match since two characters are present in the example text before the '>'.</p>

<p>PS - my doctype is HTML transitional.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>I think I have evidence this is specific to the string.split() behavior on IE, and not regex in general.  You have to use split() to see this issue.  I have also found a test matrix that shows a failure rate of about 30% for split() test cases when I ran it on IE.  The same tests passed 100% on FF and Chrome:</p>

","9021","","<p>The method you have is the right way, but you might need some hacks to avoid the visual flicker that this will give you.</p>

<p>Try moving the div off-screen, checking the height and then moving it back. Also while we're here, avoid using multiple jQuery look-ups if possible <code>$('.detail')</code> as this can be a quite expensive operation.</p>

<pre><code>var $detail = $('.detail');
$detail
    .css({position : 'absolute', left: '-10000px'})
    .data('origHeight', $detail.height())
    .css({position : '', left : '', height : '130px', overflow : 'hidden'})

<p>Alternatively, if this isn't working for you, don't work against it, work with it. It might pay to consider ways to adapt it into your design, for example, by starting at its full size and then animating back to 130px. This will let you gracefully check its normal size, as well as let the user know that there's more information to be seen there.</p>

"<p>I was recently reading <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/233030/worst-php-practice-found-in-your-experience/233746"">this thread</a>, on some of the worst PHP practices.
In the second answer there is a mini discussion on the use of extract(), and im just wondering what all the huff is about.</p>

<p>I personally use it to chop up a given array such as $_GET or $_POST where I then sanitize the variables later, as they have been conveniently named for me. </p>

<p>Is this bad practice? What is the risk here? What are your thoughts on the use of extract()?</p>

<p>Thank you,</p>
","9021","","<p>I find that it is only bad practice in that it can lead to a number of variables which future maintainers (or yourself in a few weeks) have no idea where they're coming from. Consider this scenario:</p>

<pre><code>extract($someArray); // could be $_POST or anything

/* snip a dozen or more lines */

echo $someVariable;
</code></pre>

<p>Where did <code>$someVariable</code> come from? How can anyone tell?</p>

<p>I don't see the problem in accessing the variables from within the array they started in, so you'd really need to present a good case <em>for</em> using <code>extract()</code> for me to think it's worth it. If you're really concerned about typing out some extra characters then just do this:</p>

<pre><code>$a = $someLongNameOfTheVariableArrayIDidntWantToType;

$a['myVariable'];
</code></pre>

<p>I think the comments here on the security aspects of it are overblown somewhat. The function can take a second parameter that actually gives you fairly good control over the newly created variables, including not overwriting any existing variables (<code>EXTR_SKIP</code>), ONLY overwriting existing variables (so you can create a whitelist) (<code>EXTR_IF_EXISTS</code>), or adding prefixes to the variables (<code>EXTR_PREFIX_ALL</code>).</p>

"<p>Here's my situation with rough numbers. I'd like to know if my thinking (at the bottom) seems sound to you guys. (Side note: I've read many of the related questions on here, and helpful as they were, none seemed to touch on this specific issue.)</p>

<p>For 2 years I was a senior developer at Company X. I was full-time, W-2, and making $100k/yr with benefits. (Roughly $50/hr).</p>

<p>[Then I got laid off, but that's not the point. I am in a large city and can find work easily. I am very happy to work from home rather than in an office.]</p>

<p>For 2 months I've done a few freelance projects for Company Y, a web firm. This was 1099, and I am charging $80/hr. (I did 100 or so hours over 2 or so months and figured I'd need to get some other clients soon).</p>

<p>Company Y loves my work and has gained new jobs because of it. They want more of my time and have offered me a 6 month contract, paid a fixed monthly rate regardless of hours (they assume 40ish per week). I'd still be working remotely.</p>

<p>SO...</p>

<p>My freelance rate is higher than my old W-2 full-time rate for obvious reasons. I also realize that since freelancing ""full time"" requires lots of administrivia and sales, I would never really be racking up 40 hrs/wk at my $80 rate. (I've been toying with the idea of charging any other clients more, like $100/hr.)</p>

<p>However, I realize that from Company Y's perspective, offering me the security of a 6 month retainer contract should drive my hourly rate down (bulk discount?) since I'd now have way more billable hours and less administrivia. This still has got to be a raise on my old W-2 job for it to be worth my while though, especially due to the lack of benefits and the more complex tax situation.</p>

<p>Now I wish I had originally charged Company Y $100/hr for the initial freelance projects so that I could give them a better deal and charge them $80/hr for this 6 month contract.</p>

<p>Sorry for being so long winded, but I hope you guys get my drift. Essentially, I should be giving them a lower hourly, but I really don't want to.</p>

<p>Is my assumption correct that as far as hourly rates go,</p>

<p><strong>full-time-W-2 &lt; long-term 1099 &lt; short-term-project-based 1099</strong> ?</p>

<p>If so, what might a good negotiation strategy be with Company Y to keep my hourly rate as is, and effectively nix their bulk discount? ""Hey guys, you were getting a super low rate on those individual projects!""</p>
","9021","","<p>6 months, 40 hours per week = almost 1000 hours, therefore for every dollar you drop from your hourly rate, you'll be discounting them $1000, so a drop of $5-6/hr should be significant enough, IMO.</p>

"<p>I am trying to create a simple mouseover effect using a combination of mouseover, mouseout, addClass, and removeClass.  Basically, when the user mouses over an element, I want to apply a different border (1px dashed gray).  The initial state is ""1px solid white"".  I have a class called ""highlight"" which simply has ""border: 1px dashed gray"" in it.  I want to add that class onmouseover and remove it on onmouseout but I am unable to get the effect I want unless I use !important within the ""highlight"" class.</p>
","9021","","<p>It sounds as though you've got the javascript working fine as is, but it's just a problem with the <a href=""http://htmldog.com/guides/cssadvanced/specificity/"">specificity of your CSS rules</a>, which is why <code>!important</code> makes it work.</p>

<p>You just have to make your highlighted css rules more specific than the non-highlighted rules.</p>

<pre><code>#someItem ul li { /* Specificity = 102 */
    border-color: white;
}

.highlight { /* Specificity = 10 -- not specific enough! */
    border-color: grey;    
}

#someItem ul li.highlight { /* Specificity = 112 -- this will work */
    border-color: grey;    
}
</code></pre>

<p><hr /></p>

<p><strong>Edit with further explanation:</strong><br />
Let's say the relevant parts of your HTML look like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""someItem""&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Item 1&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Item 2&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Item 3&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and you have this CSS:</p>

<pre><code>#someItem ul li {
    border: 1px solid white;
}
.highlight {
    border-color: grey;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Currently, all the list items in the <code>ul</code> in <code>#someItem div</code> will have a white border, and nothing has the class <code>highlight</code> so nothing's grey.</p>

<p>Through whatever means you want (in your case a hover event in jQuery), you add a class to one of the items:</p>

<pre><code>$(this).addClass('highlight');
</code></pre>

<p>The HTML will now look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""someItem""&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Item 1&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li class=""highlight""&gt;Item 2&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Item 3&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So far, your Javascript and HTML are working fine, but you don't see a grey border! The problem is your CSS. When the browser is trying to decide how to style the element, it looks at all the different selectors which target an element and the styles defined in those selectors. If there are two different selectors both defining the same style (in our case, the border colour is contested), then it has to decide which style to apply and which to ignore. It does this by means of what is known as ""Specificity"" - that is, how specific a selector is. As outlined in the <a href=""http://htmldog.com/guides/cssadvanced/specificity/"">HTML Dog article</a>, it does this by assigning a value to each part of your selector, and the one with the highest score wins. The points are:</p>

<ul>
<li>element selector (eg: ""ul"", ""li"", ""table"") = 1 point</li>
<li>class selector (eg: "".highlight"", "".active"", "".menu"") = 10 points</li>
<li>id selector (eg: ""#someItem"", ""#mainContent"") = 100 points</li>
</ul>

<p>There are some more rules, eg: the keyword <code>!important</code> and also inline styles, but that's mostly irrelevant for this, uhh... ""lesson"". The only other thing you should know is that if two selectors have the same specificity, then the one defined later in the file wins.</p>

<p>Going back to your problem, given the CSS we had before, we can see why it's still not got a grey border:</p>

<pre>
#someItem ul li = id + element + element = 100 + 1 + 1 = 102 points
.highlight = class = 10 points
</pre>

<p>As mentioned earlier, the solution is to create a more specific selector:</p>

<pre>
#someItem ul li.highlight
   = id + element + element + class
   = 100 + 1 + 1 + 10
   = 112 points
</pre>

<p>And to answer your question in the comments, you don't need to change any of your javascript or HTML for this to work. If you break down that selector, what it's saying is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Look for the element with id ""someItem"", inside that look for a ul element, and then an li element which has the class ""highlight"" on it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...and now, given the simple <code>.addClass()</code> call that you made earlier, the <code>li</code> satisfies these conditions, so the border should turn grey.</p>

"<p>I need to selectively flatten an array in PHP, but do it selectively. If a key matches a pattern then all sub elements below that key should be included in the 'flat' output.</p>

","9021","","<p>Ok, I'm going to assume your data looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>$data = array(
    ""Bill Withers"" =&gt; array (
        ""Lovely Day"",
        ""Use Me"",
        ""Ain't No Sunshine""

    ""Fleet Foxes"" =&gt; array (

        ""White Winter Hymnal""
    ),
    ""Billy Joel"" =&gt; array (
        ""Piano Man""
    )
);
</code></pre>

<p>...and that given the input <code>""Bill""</code>, you want the output: <code>[""Lovely Day"", ""Use Me"", ""Ain't No Sunshine"", ""Piano Man""]</code>. Here's one way you could do it.</p>

<pre><code>function getSongs($data, $searchTerm) {
    $output = array();
    foreach ($data as $artist =&gt; $songs) {
        if (stripos($artist, $searchTerm) !== false)) {
            $output = array_merge($output, $songs);
        }
    }
    return $output;
}

<p>...I'll also assume you've got a good reason to not use a database for this.</p>
"
"<p>I have a server which is set to EST, and all records in the database are set to EST. I would like to know how to set it to GMT. I want to offer a time zone option to my users.</p>
","9021","","<p>I would <em>strongly</em> suggest avoiding messing with UNIX timestamps to make it look like a different time zone. This is a lesson I've learnt the hard way, way too many times.</p>

<p>A timestamp is the number of seconds since Midnight 1 January 1970, GMT. It doesn't matter where you are in the world, a given timestamp represents the exact same moment in time, regardless of time zones. Yes, the timestamp ""0"" means 10am 1/1/70 in Australia, Midnight 1/1/70 in London and 5pm 31/12/69 in LA, but this doesn't mean you can simply add or subtract values and guarantee accuracy.</p>

<p>The golden example which stuffed me up every year for way too long was when daylight savings would crop up. Daylight savings means that there are ""clock times"" which don't exist in certain parts of the world. For example, in most parts of the US, there was no such time as 2:01am on April 2, 2006.</p>

<p>Enough quasi-intelligible ranting though. My advice is to store your dates in the database as timestamps, and then...</p>

<ul>
<li>If you need the local time at the server, use <a href=""http://php.net/date""><code>date()</code></a></li>
<li>If you need to get GMT, then use <a href=""http://php.net/gmdate""><code>gmdate()</code></a></li>
<li>If you need to get a different timezone, use <a href=""http://php.net/date%5Fdefault%5Ftimezone%5Fset""><code>date_default_timezone_set()</code></a> and then <code>date()</code></li>
</ul>

<p>For example, </p>

<pre><code>$timestamp = time();

echo ""BRISBANE: "" . date('r', $timestamp) . ""\n"";
echo ""     UTC: "" . gmdate('r', $timestamp) . ""\n"";
date_default_timezone_set('Africa/Johannesburg');
echo ""  JOBURG: "" . date('r', $timestamp) . ""\n"";

// BRISBANE: Tue, 12 May 2009 18:28:20 +1000
//      UTC: Tue, 12 May 2009 08:28:20 +0000
//   JOBURG: Tue, 12 May 2009 10:28:20 +0200
</code></pre>

<p>This will keep your values clean (you don't have to be worrying about adding offsets, and then subtracting before saving), it will respect all Daylight Savings rules, and you also don't have to even look up the timezone of the place you want.</p>

but you want

A, E, I

So you need to change your input to this:

","9021","","<p>The data from your form will be accessible in PHP in the $_POST variable (or $_GET, but you should probably use $_POST, eg: <code>&lt;form method=""post""&gt;</code>).</p>

    $values[] = ""('"" . mysql_real_escape_string($_POST['children'][$i]) . ""'""

<p>The mb_* functions work with multi-byte string. The manual says:</p>

  <p>By contrast to strtolower(), 'alphabetic' is determined by the Unicode character properties. Thus the behaviour of this function is not affected by locale settings and it can convert any characters that have 'alphabetic' property, such as A-umlaut (Ä). </p>

<p>What I would really love, is to be able to do something as simple as:</p>

<pre><code>foreach ($settingsarray as $settingsfile)
{
    {//added braces to indicate where the isolation is
    	include ($settingsfile);
    	// do stuff here
    }//what happens in here does not affect what happens outside of here
}
</code></pre>

<p>I should just note, this is part of a new feature, and is the only part of the code that loads all the $settingsfiles. The rest of the code only ever loads one file at a time. One reason I am using constants is so that I don't have to worry about defining variables ""global"" to be able to access them inside functions.</p>
","9021","","<p>Okay, so if I'm understanding you correctly, inside that loop you'd like to do things with the constants defined inside each <code>$settingsfile</code> and then basically get rid of them after each loop?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unlike variables, a constant is a value that, once set, cannot be changed or unset during the execution of your script

"<p>I have a small application in which i have 9 different forms, and every form have a least 40+ fields where the user must enter some data.</p>

","9021","","<p>I've used something similar in one of my projects. Basically, I define all the fields, including how to display them, what data type they have (number, date, etc), as well as what to do with them once posted back.

"<p>I'm curious to know the differences between the bind and live functions.</p>

<p>To me they seem to be almost identical.</p>

<p>I read <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/748076/using-live-benefits-similar-to-bind"">the benefits of live/bind methods</a>, but it didn't tell me about the differences...</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","9021","","<p>In short: <code>.bind()</code> will only apply to the items you currently have selected in your jQuery object. <code>.live()</code> will apply to all current matching elements, as well as any you might add in the future.</p>

<p>The underlying difference between them is that <code>live()</code> makes use of <a href=""http://www.quirksmode.org/js/events_order.html"">event bubbling</a>. That is, when you click on a button, that button might exist in a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, in a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, in a <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element; so in effect, you're actually clicking on all of those elements at the same time.</p>

<p><code>live()</code> works by attaching your event handler to the <em>document</em>, not to the <em>element</em>. When you click on that button, as illustrated before, the document receives the same click event. It then looks back up the line of elements targeted by the event and checks to see if any of them match your query.</p>

<p>The outcome of this is twofold: firstly, it means that you don't have to continue reapplying events to new elements, since they'll be implicitly added when the event happens. However, more importantly (depending on your situation), it means that your code is much much lighter! If you have 50 <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tags on the page and you run this code:</p>

<pre><code>$('img').click(function() { /* doSomething */ });
</code></pre>

<p>...then that function is <em>copied</em> into each of those elements. However, if you had this code:</p>

<pre><code>$('img').live('click', function() { /* doSomething */ });
</code></pre>

<p>...then that function is stored only in one place (on the document), and is applied to whatever matches your query at event time.</p>

<p>Because of this bubbling behaviour though, not all events can be handled this way. As Ichiban noted, these supported events are click, dblclick mousedown, mouseup, mousemove, mouseover, mouseout, keydown, keypress, keyup.</p>

"<p>At my work, we're interested in tracking how often people print our web pages.  (If a lot of people are doing it, we'll probably put more focus on making the print view nicer.)</p>

<p>Obviously if we put a ""Print"" button on the page, we can log when people click on that, but if users just use the ""File"" menu and choose ""Print,"" we have no way of knowing if they did that.</p>

<p>Is there some clever way to use print-only CSS to cause the browser to issue a web request only when printing?  My experiments seem to say no, but this seems like it should be possible.</p>

<p>Edit: A reasonable answer is offered below that works in FF; I'm offering a 100 point bounty for a solution that works on IE as well.</p>
","9021","","<p>You could have a ""print version"" page and put some server-side logging on that page, however that could be a bit annoying for all parties involved.</p>

<p>What else you could do to is something like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>On page load, use javascript to add a print-only stylesheet on the page which hides everything except a message saying ""Please use the print link on this page"".
<ul>
<li>Use javascript here so that users with JS disabled will still be able to print as normal. You won't be able to log them, but you won't piss them off either.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Put a link on the page which, when clicked, logs the event via AJAX, removes that stylesheet and then calls <code>window.print()</code></li>

"<p>Given a list of words, how would you go about arranging them into a crossword grid?</p>

<p>It wouldn't have to be like a ""proper"" crossword puzzle which is symmetrical or anything like that: basically just output a starting position and direction for each word.</p>

<p>Would there be any Java examples available?</p>
","9021","","<p>I came up with a solution which probably isn't the most efficient, but it works well enough. Basically:</p>

<ol>
<li>Sort all the words by length, descending.</li>
<li>Take the first word and place it on the board.</li>
<li>Take the next word.</li>
<li>Search through all the words that are already on the board and see if there are any possible intersections (any common letters) with this word.</li>
<li>If there is a possible location for this word, loop through all the words that are on the board and check to see if the new word interferes.</li>
<li>If this word doesn't break the board, then place it there and go to step 3, otherwise, continue searching for a place (step 4).</li>
<li>Continue this loop until all the words are either placed or unable to be placed.</li>
</ol>

<p>This makes a working, yet often quite poor crossword. There were a number of alterations I made to the basic recipe above to come up with a better result.</p>

<ul>
<li>At the end of generating a crossword, give it a score based on how many of the words were placed (the more the better), how large the board is (the smaller the better), and the ratio between height and width (the closer to 1 the better). Generate a number of crosswords and then compare their scores and choose the best one.
<ul>
<li>Instead of running an arbitrary number of iterations, I've decided to create as many crosswords as possible in an arbitrary amount of time. If you only have a small word list, then you'll get dozens of possible crosswords in 5 seconds.  A larger crossword might only be chosen from 5-6 possibilities.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>When placing a new word, instead of placing it immediately upon finding an acceptable location, give that word location a score based on how much it increases the size of the grid and how many intersections there are (ideally you'd want each word to be crossed by 2-3 other words). Keep track of all the positions and their scores and then choose the best one.</li>

"<p>i am writing code to insert data into mysql on same page from where i retrive data by post method . it working fine but when i refresh page it will insert again. 
my question is that how to stop reexcuting the insert query on refreshing page</p>
","9021","","<p>This is being caused by the POST data being sent again when you refresh. Your browser should give you a warning that it's doing that. If you're not getting that warning, you might be using GET instead of POST which is not a good idea for actions which change or insert data.</p>

<p>Check your form has this attribute:</p>

<p>If you want to avoid it altogether, just redirect the browser after the post back.</p>

if ($_POST) {
    // insert into database
    header(""location: thisPage.php"");
    // don't bother with die() here

<p>This is unnecessary and slower to run. Just change it to <code>$('#saveForm')</code> and the query will only need to do one lookup.</p>

","9021","","<p>Playing around with how input fields work is dangerous territory. By using a series of event handlers to listen for key presses you could probably make it work 95% of the time. The other five percent of the time your users will be cursing your name. Consider those who will copy and paste into the text box (probably quite a few since it's 9 digits?). I'm sure there's plenty of other cases where the normal events wouldn't fire as expected.</p>

<p>Here's another method which might work: when the input is blurred (that is, loses focus) after the user has typed their input, then apply your masking and formatting to the element. If it gets focus again, then strip out your extra punctuation so the user can just deal with the numbers. eg:</p>

<pre><code>1: user enters numbers, it will look like this:
________________
| 123456789    |
________________

2: user moves to the next input, it will change to this:
________________
| 123.456.789  |
________________

","9021","","<p>In javascript, functions are treated as normal variables, just like a string or an int. obviously they have some extra features, but you can use them in the same way, for example, you could store a number of functions in an array, or pass a function to another function. Given that, I can't see any need to name functions in the way it looks like you're trying to.</p>

<p>I wish I could give you some more help for your specific problem, but it's a little hard to understand, sorry.</p>

<p>You could try changing your <code>unCheckRadio</code> function so that it takes a function as a parameter:</p>

<pre><code>function unCheckRadio(num, func) { ... }
</code></pre>

<p>and then you'd call it like this:</p>

<pre><code>function unCheckRadio(5, function() {
    // do whatever here.
});
</code></pre>

","9021","","<p><em>I'm adding this as a different answer because, well, it's different!</em></p>

<p>If you want to call a global function (or any function you know the scope of) given a suffix like that, then you could just use array notation:</p>

<pre><code>window['makeChoice_ang' + i]();

<p>I have an article that I want to publish on my Joomla! site. Every time I click apply or save. I get error <code>500 - An error has occurred! DB function reports no errors</code>. I have no idea why this error comes up, al I can think is that it's a server error. </p>

<p>I'm using TinyMCE to type articles together with Joomla! 1.5.11. </p>

<p>Updated: I turned on Maximum error reporting in Joomla! and in the article manager I tried to save the article and got these couple of errors. Please check screenshot</p>

<p><img src=""http://techportal.co.za/images/articles/error.png"" alt=""alt text"" /></p>

<p>I tried adding </p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
ini_set('error_reporting', E_ALL);
error_reporting(E_ALL);
ini_set('log_errors',TRUE);
ini_set('html_errors',TRUE);
ini_set('display_errors',true);
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>at the top of the index.php pages for Joomla! but it does not show any errors. I checked the error logs on the server and also no errors come up. </p>

<p>I managed to publish the article via phpMyAdmin but then something else happens. I try to access to article from the front end, by clicking on the link to the article, but only a blank page comes up.</p>

<p>This is really weird, since the error log does not show any information. So I assume the error needs to be coming from Joomla!</p>

<p>What I have now is the check between 2 numbers, I need to have it checked all, so all the B numbers have to be checked with all the A numbers. I think i'll need a sort of loop in a array, but I really don't know how to do this. Can somebody help me with this please?</p>
","9021","","<p>I'm assuming that you want the user to type in a series of numbers, and then compare them against another set to see if they match.</p>

<p>The process will be something like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Get the numbers from the inputs on the page, store into an array.</li>
<li>Compare that array with another array to see if all the members are the same.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are a multitude of ways to do step number one. The simplest way (definitely not the best way, but the easiest) would be something like this:</p>

<pre><code>var myNumbers = [];
myNumbers.push(document.getElementById('firstInput'));
myNumbers.push(document.getElementById('secondInput'));
myNumbers.push(document.getElementById('thirdInput'));
myNumbers.push(document.getElementById('fourthInput'));
</code></pre>

<p>Then to compare, put the ""correct"" numbers into an array as well, sort them and then compare each member:</p>

<pre><code>var correctNumbers = [5,3,7,1];
correctNumbers.sort();
myNumbers.sort();

for (var i = 0, l = correctNumbers; i &lt; l; ++i) {
    if (correctNumbers[i] != myNumbers[i]) {
        // they don't match!
    }
}
// if you get to here and haven't found any discrepancies,
// then the two arrays match.

"<p>I've just been pondering the jQuery <code>live()</code> event binder, which seems like a really useful function.</p>

<p><a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Events/live"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.jquery.com/Events/live</a></p>

<p>One thing I note is that it doesn't support all events:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""<strong>Currently not supported</strong>: blur, focus,
  mouseenter, mouseleave, change, submit""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My (very simple) mind reasons that surely if it were implemented for one event, it would be easy to do it for all others?</p>

<p>Clearly its wasn't that simple, so I wondered if anyone knows why it was so difficult to do it for all others?</p>
","9021","","<p>As I understand it:</p>

<p>When you use <code>live()</code> an event handler is attached to the <code>document</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>

<p>Given this snippet:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""#""&gt;my link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>When you click or move the mouse on the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag, you have to remember that your <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> is sitting inside an <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> which is inside a <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> in a <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> in <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> which is inside the <code>document</code>. No matter what HTML structure you have, every element exists within the <code>document</code>.</p>

<p>So, when you click the link, you're actually also clicking all those other elements too, it's just that the link is sitting on top<code>*</code> of that stack. This is called <em>bubbling</em> - the click event starts on the link and bubbles up through each of its parents finally reaching the <code>document</code>. Any time you click <em>any</em> element you're also clicking the <code>document</code>.</p>

<p>Therefore, if you place an event listener on the <code>document</code> to handle clicks, it can check where <em>else</em> was clicked in that same event before it bubbled to the <code>document</code>. The <code>live()</code> function simply stores the query string you provided and compares that against all clicked (or <code>mousemove</code>d, etc) elements and fires your function if it gets a hit.</p>

<p>The others: <code>blur</code>, <code>focus</code>, <code>mouseenter</code>, <code>mouseleave</code>, <code>change</code>, <code>submit</code> are all events which don't bubble, therefore they can't be used with <code>live()</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Why don't they bubble?</strong></p>

<p>Because if you think about it, it doesn't make sense. If you focus an element, you are only focusing <em>one</em> element, not its parents and ancestors. Similarly with the others - the events never reach the document so you can't use this technique.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>*</code>: as with many ""tree"" metaphors in computing, terms like ""up"" and ""top"" can be a bit confusing. Though your link is visually rendered at the top, it's probably more helpful to think of it as at the bottom. The events bubble upwards through parents and reach the top level element which is the ""root"". <code>:-/</code></p>

"<p>I search for and process XML files from elsewhere, and need to
transform them with some XSLTs. No problem. Using PHP5 and the DOM
library, everything's a snap. Worked fine, up till now. Today, funky

like. Anyways, DOMDocument->load complained about them, saying that
they weren't UTF-8, and to specify the encoding.</p>

<p>Lo and behold, the encoding is not specified in these XML files. If I
add in 'encoding=""iso-8859-1""' to the header, it works fine. The rub is
I have no control over these XML files.</p>

out to another location seems to be my only option, but I'd prefer to do
it without having to use temporary copies of the XML files at all. Is

<p>You're not using something like <code>sprintf</code> to build the string are you? If so, you need to escape the <code>%</code> with another <code>%</code></p>

<p>In any case, you can use the function <a href=""http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/date-and-time-functions.html#function%5Fdate"" rel=""nofollow""><code>DATE()</code></a></p>

"<p>Sometimes I work with bad smelling code. Yes, there's bad code out there :) I'm not talking about design problem but about much more simple things like:</p>

<ul>
<li>messy indentation</li>
<li>non consistent use of empty lines</li>
<li>a big banners introducing functions, which just repeat the function/method names</li>
<li>non consistent name conversion, even in the same line</li>
<li>badly stuctured function logic (e.g. redundant checks, repetitions etc.)</li>
<li>tightly coupling of data and logic</li>
<li>and much more</li>
</ul>

<p>An example just to visualize what I'm talking about (C++)</p>

<pre><code>class MyClass 
{
   public:
   /*******************************************************
      | constructor                                             |
   ********************************************************/
   MyClass()
  {
  }

   /*******************************************************
   | destructor                       |
   ********************************************************/
   ~MyClass() {}    

   void Foo(char *Name, const char* Type, char* sub_type);
  };
</code></pre>

<p>I personally dislike to work with such code, it just discourages me to write good code, discourages to think about more high level obstructions.</p>

<p>Mostly it drives me crazy when coworkers developers don't understand when you say to them that something is wrong with the code - they just happily continue to support the mess.</p>

<p>Unfortunately managers are not interested in ""beauty"" of code, don't see the impact of bad code in long term. When there's a spare window nothing is done to clean/improve code - this never scheduled as a task/project. Sometimes to my complaints I hear a well known response:  <strong>""it works-don't touch it""</strong>.</p>

<p>I think this is a evil, bad practice. Not handling the problems is like a fat, that makes you clumsy, not competitive.</p>

<p>What to do? Constantly complain to deliver the problem? This will only gain you a bad name and managers won't understand what are you so not happy about. Changing code in your free time? Also not good - you can not take a risk of introducing a bug?</p>

<p>Writing good code should be an integral part of development process.</p>

<p>Do you have the same dilemma? What did you do to improve the situation?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>The subject language is C++.</p>

<p>A new piece of code is written in an uncontrolled form, with emphasis on functionality. No code reviews or coding standards are currently affecting it (if they ever did). I want to change the situation, but just don't know how. </p>

<p><strong>Update 01</strong></p>

<p>Let's say that we want to perform only ""syntax"" refactoring on a big code base. For example fixing indentation, renaming variable (by using refactor tools of course - not by hand :))). Is it worth to do it and probably introduce a couple of bugs?</p>
","9021","","<p>I just wanted to pose the opposite argument from that which everyone else here seems to take. Sloppiness anywhere in your code is a dangerous thing and allowing messy and inconsistent source code to go unchecked can lead to some massive problems down the track.</p>

<p>In a previous job I had, there was no clear style guide on things like variable or function naming, meaning that you'd have to continually jump into the source of your libraries to see whether it was <code>get_id()</code>, <code>getid()</code>, <code>getId()</code> or <code>getID()</code>. Given that this code is being continuously worked upon and maintained, it's <em>very</em> important to avoid these situations.</p>

<p>Developing a standard style guide laying out naming conventions, indentation style, etc will go a long way to improving the readability and maintainability of the codebase.</p>

<p>Fixing up the messiness of what you already have should probably be done incrementally so that a) management doesn't think that you're not doing any work, and b) any introduced errors can be ironed out quickly.</p>
"
"<p>What is the difference between these two usages of foreach?</p>

<pre><code>foreach ($nodes as $node) {
 //do stuff
}

foreach ($odp in $ftw) {
  //do more stuff
}
</code></pre>
","9021","","<p>Using <code>in</code> in PHP doesn't work. In Javascript however, a similar form is acceptable and they differ thusly:</p>

<pre><code>var obj = {
    'a' : 'Apple',
    'b' : 'Banana',
    'c' : 'Carrot'
};

for (var i in obj) {
    alert(i); // ""a"", ""b"", ""c""
}

for each (var i in obj) {
    alert(i); // ""Apple"", ""Banana"", ""Carrot""
}
</code></pre>

<p>basically, <code>for each ... in ...</code> (Javascript) or <code>foreach ... as ...</code> (PHP) will give the value of the properties of the object, whereas <code>for ... in ...</code> (javascript) will give you the name of each property.</p>

"<p>In creating CSS styles one approach seems to be a fully qualified style such as</p>

<pre><code>#pnlImage div.ipd-imageInfo div.ipd-tags span.ipd-tag
</code></pre>

<p>compared to a shorter definition such as</p>

<pre><code>div.ipd-tags span.ipd-tag
</code></pre>

<p>which would uniquely identify the style as well. However, if the site is expanded or changed the 2nd style runs the risk of not uniquely identifying the element.</p>

<p>Is there a performance hit from fully qualifying a style, i.e., it is longer? Are there some guidelines/best practice references for style naming?</p>

<li>Looking up an <code>#id</code> is fast.</li>
<li>Looking up a <code>tag</code> is a bit slower.</li>
<li>Looking up a <code>.class</code> is the slowest.</li>
</ol>

<p>Starting your selectors with a faster lookup will reduce the number of lookups required for then next part. That is, if I wrote <code>p.myClass</code>, then the browser can very quickly find all the <code>p</code> tags and then it only has to loop through those to check for the class name.</p>

"<p>What is the purpose of these lines:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>Can someone explain the usage here? </p>

<p>I see the top line being used as first line in a php file, then the second line being used to populate the title. </p>

<p>Why this implementation? What is the purpose other than an object?</p>

<p>I guess the purpose maybe could be to reuse the object across the session. Unsure.</p>
","9021","","<p>Adding linebreaks and comments:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
$title = $cfg &amp;&amp; is_object($cfg)   // if $cfg isn't empty (false, 0, null) and it's an object
       ? $cfg-&gt;getTitle()  // then set $title to the return of getTitle()
       : 'Apptitle :: My First App'; // otherwise use this as a default
?&gt;

&lt;?=Format::htmlchars($title)?&gt;  // this is a shortcut for echo. it probably escapes
                                // special characters: &lt; becomes &amp;lt; etc

<p>Basically all it's doing is checking your <code>$cfg</code> object (whatever that is) to see if there's a <code>title</code> set - if not, it provides a default. It then prints it to the screen in a html-friendly way. Nothing to do with sessions or anything like that.</p>

<p>Another quick point: in your own code, you should avoid using the shortcut <code>&lt;?=</code> since it's not very portable. That is, even though it might work on your testing server, your deployment site or someone else who wants to use your code might have it turned off. It's recommended to avoid it.</p>

","9021","","<p>Your PHP page communicates back to the Javascript just through outputting the data. Depending on the plugin, you could achieve a <code>true</code>/<code>false</code> by echoing 1 or 0, or perhaps even the string <code>true</code> or <code>false</code></p>

<p>The manual says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The response is evaluated as JSON and must be <code>true</code> for valid elements, and can be any <code>false, undefined or null</code> for invalid elements</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you can change your PHP to this:</p>

<pre><code>if (mysql_num_rows($res) &gt; 0) {
    $output = true;
} else {
    $output = false;
}
echo json_encode($output);

"<p>I have an article that I want to publish on my Joomla! site. Every time I click apply or save. I get error <code>500 - An error has occurred! DB function reports no errors</code>. I have no idea why this error comes up, al I can think is that it's a server error. </p>

<p>I'm using TinyMCE to type articles together with Joomla! 1.5.11. </p>

<p>Updated: I turned on Maximum error reporting in Joomla! and in the article manager I tried to save the article and got these couple of errors. Please check screenshot</p>

<p><img src=""http://techportal.co.za/images/articles/error.png"" alt=""alt text"" /></p>

<p>I tried adding </p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
ini_set('error_reporting', E_ALL);
error_reporting(E_ALL);
ini_set('log_errors',TRUE);
ini_set('html_errors',TRUE);
ini_set('display_errors',true);
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>at the top of the index.php pages for Joomla! but it does not show any errors. I checked the error logs on the server and also no errors come up. </p>

<p>I managed to publish the article via phpMyAdmin but then something else happens. I try to access to article from the front end, by clicking on the link to the article, but only a blank page comes up.</p>

<p>This is really weird, since the error log does not show any information. So I assume the error needs to be coming from Joomla!</p>

<p>This happens if I add a print_r($_POST) before <code>if (!$row-&gt;check()) {</code> on /administrator/components/com_content/controller.php (around line 693)</p>

","9021","","<p>Looking at your POST array, it looks like the body text of your post isn't being sent. This would suggest it's a problem on the front end. Can you check the <code>name</code> of the HTML element where you are typing the body text? If you could edit and show us the relevant parts of the HTML form that would help too.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p><strong>edit:</strong> ok, that article you linked to is almost 150,000 bytes, so it might be that it's choking on it. If this is a once-off article that you probably won't have to edit too much, I'd recommend putting in some dummy text and then going into your database using phpMyAdmin or something and editing the text in the <code>jos_content</code> table. The <code>introtext</code> and <code>fulltext</code> columns are defined as <code>MEDIUMTEXT</code> so they should be able to hold up to about 16MB without hassle.</p>

<p>If writing and/or editing articles of this size is something you'll be doing often (and hence, don't want to go into the DB each time), then perhaps you'll have to look at the maximum post size allowed.</p>

<p>I would ask what you want this for? By their nature, ids are essentially meaningless - all they do is identify some data, not describe it, and as such it shouldn't be a problem if you have large gaps in your user ids.

"<p>The following code is used so when clicking 'enter' when focused in an input field within a form, it disables the standard submit button functionality.  Rather the javascript builds a new form and sends a post request to another page.  I am using this so that I can achieve a ""form within a form"" functionality.  The input field has its own submit button for which I have similar code to perform the post.</p>

<p>In firefox, this works perfectly; in IE hitting enter does nothing at all.  Here is the code:</p>

<pre><code>//event handler for input field within standard form
$('#inputfield').bind('keypress', function(e) {
    var code = e.keyCode || e.which;
    if(code==13){
    	//suppress default submit functionality
    	$('form').submit(function () {
    	    return false;
    	});

        var url_string = ""..."";

        var $form = $(""&lt;form method='POST'&gt;"").attr(""action"", url_string);
        $(""&lt;input type='hidden' name='body'&gt;"").attr(""value"",body).appendTo($form);

        $(""&lt;input type='hidden' name='title'&gt;"").attr(""value"",title).appendTo($form);

        //...create more form elements here...

        $form.appendTo(""body"");
        $form.submit();
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>Any ideas why this isn't working in IE (I tried in IE 6,7 and 8)?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> just to elaborate on the problem: in firefox, the <code>$form.submit();</code> line at the end causes the jquery generated form to submit and the page to redirect. In IE nothing happens at all.  The keypress <em>does</em> fire in IE, its just that the form doesnt seem to get submitted.</p>
","9021","","<p>What happens if you try using the normal DOM submit method instead of jQuery's?</p>

<pre><code>// instead of:
// $form.submit();
// try this:
$form[0].submit();

<blockquote>

<p>Ok, that would suggest that your jQuery object is empty. It might be the appendTo which is doing strange things... try this:</p>

<pre><code>$form = $form.appendTo(""body"");
$form.submit();
</code></pre>

<p>and if that doesn't work, put in these debugging lines:</p>

<pre><code>alert($form.length);
$form.appendTo(""body"");
alert($form.length);
$form.submit();
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Ok, I've got it now:</strong></p>

<p>It's the line where you generate the form which is causing the problem. Change it to this:</p>

<pre><code>var $form = $(""&lt;form&gt;&lt;/form&gt;"").attr({""action"" : url_string, ""method"" : ""POST""});

  <p>Simple elements without attributes, e.g., <code>""&lt;div /&gt;""</code>, are created via <code>document.createElement</code>. All other cases are parsed by assigning the string to the <code>.innerHTML</code> property of a <code>div</code> element. The HTML string cannot contain elements that are invalid within a div, such as html, head, body, or title elements.</p>
  
  <p>All HTML must be well-formed, otherwise it may not work correctly across all browsers. This includes the case where <code>$(""&lt;span&gt;"")</code> may not work but <code>$(""&lt;span/&gt;"")</code> will (note the XML-style closing slash).</p>

"<p>PHP uses ""magic quotes"" by default but has gotten a lot of flak for it. I understand it will disable it in next major version of PHP.</p>

<p>While the arguments against it makes sense, what I don't get it is why not just use the HTML entities to represent quotes instead of stripping and removing slashes? After all, a VAST majority of mySQL is used for outputting to web browsers?  </p>

<p>For example, &amp;#039; is used instead of ' and it won't affect the database at all. </p>

<p>Another question, why can't PHP just have configurations set up for each version of PHP with this tag &lt;?php4 or &lt;?php5 so appropriate interpreters can be loaded for those versions? </p>

","9021","","<p>The reason that MySQL doesn't convert <code>'</code> to <code>&amp;#039;</code> is because <code>&amp;#039;</code> <em>is not</em> <code>'</code>.  If you want to convert your data for output, you should be doing that at the view layer, not in your database. It's really not very hard to just call <code>htmlentities</code> before/when you echo.</p>

","9021","","<p><a href=""#1340880"" rel=""nofollow"">Justin's answer</a> explains it pretty well, but I thought I'd just add that the first set of parentheses (the opening one before <code>function</code>) is actually completely unnecessary as far as program execution is concerned. For readability, however, it's very important! When I see this:</p>

<pre><code>(function() {

<p>I <strong>know</strong> that this function is being called immediately, without having to scroll down to find the end of the block.

"<p>I have some serverside PHP code that attempts persist a data object (essentially an multi-dimensional array) to a backend database. This data object originally comes in as AMF actionscript object sent from a flex application. I want persist the object in whole for later use so I have used the php serialize function and encode the object down a simple string that can go into a database field. The code looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>$serializedDataObject = base64_encode(serialize($objectInstance-&gt;myDataObject));
</code></pre>

<p>When I want to revivify this object and bring it back I simply run the reverse</p>

<pre><code>$unserializedDatanObject = unserialize(base64_decode($serializedDataObject));
</code></pre>

<p>So far this seems to work well. But sometimes my php script fails. I think it is failing at the serialization step. My question is theoretically speaking what could cause a php serialization and encoding process to fail? Are there certain characters or kinds of data in the data object array that could cause the serialization to bork?</p>

<p>Do I need to do some massaging of the data object before I try to serialize it? </p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>To clarify the process works like this</p>

<p>I have a Flex/Actionscript client app that sends AMF based actionscript objects to the server. On the PHP side I am using the Zend AMF library to read the AMF data. The object can be inspected in PHP and basically looks like an associative multi-dimensional array. It is at this point that I attempt to serialize and base 64 encode the object so that I can persist the object to the database as a encoded string. </p>

<p>Hopefully this makes sense. The problem is intermittent and not so easy to reproduce consistently. If I can get some specific error messages I will post them here for further clarification. But for now I was just wondering what are the limits of serialization to help me further debug.</p>
","9021","","<p>Resources can't be serialized which might be the problem. A way to avoid this problem is to use the magic methods: <a href=""http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop.magic-functions.php""><code>__sleep</code> and <code>__wakeup</code></a>.</p>

<p>Basically, your <code>__sleep</code> function is called when you call serialize, and <code>__wakeup</code> is for when you unserialize, so say it's a database connection: in sleep() close the connection and store the connection string somewhere (perhaps), and in wakeup, reconnect.</p>

"<p>On the site I am developing, I have a file input that users can upload files from. It uses ""Ajax"" (not really) to send the file to a php file that is bound to an iframe. My question is that Firefox automatically fills in the file input element. Is there a way I can give users the option of clicking the submit button without sending the file? Or do I set the file value to null somehow and check for that in the php file? My code looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>    Name: &lt;input type='text' id='name'&gt;&lt;br&gt;

","9021","","<p>PHP measures time as seconds since Unix epoch (1st January 1970). This makes it really easy to work with, since everything just a single number.</p>

<p>To get the current time, use: <a href=""http://php.net/time"" rel=""nofollow""><code>time()</code></a></p>

<p>For basic maths like adding 30 minutes, just convert your interval into seconds and add:</p>

<pre><code>time() + 30 * 60  // (30 * 60 ==&gt; 30 minutes)
</code></pre>

<p>And since they're just numbers, just do regular old integer comparison:</p>

<pre><code>$oldTime = $_SESSION['startTime'];
$now = time();

if ($now &lt; $oldTime + 30 * 60) {
    //expired
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you need to do more complicated things like finding the date of ""next tuesday"" or something, look at <a href=""http://php.net/strtotime"" rel=""nofollow""><code>strtotime()</code></a>, but you shouldn't need it in this case.</p>

"<p>This one boggles my mind.  I've used this same script (different targets of course) on other elements in my script and it works perfectly.  Why, in this instance does the slideToggle only slide down?</p>

<p>Here is the hide, slideToggle code:</p>

<pre><code>	$('div.addLocation').hide();
	$(""p.buslocadd"").click(function() {
		$(this).prev('div.addLocation').slideToggle(400);
		return false;
	});

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""addLocation""&gt;

"<p>Is there a way to create a dynamic array of strings on Javascript?
What I mean is, on a page the user can enter one number or thirty numbers, then he/she presses the OK button and the next page shows the array in the same order as it was entered, one element at a time.</p>

<p>Code is appreciated.</p>
","9021","","<blockquote>
  <p>What I mean is, on a page the user can enter one number or thirty numbers, then he/she presses the OK button and the next page shows the array in the same order as it was entered, one element at a time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ok, so you need some user input first? There's a couple of methods of how to do that.</p>

<ol>
<li>First is the <code>prompt()</code> function which displays a popup asking the user for some input.
<ul>
<li>Pros: easy. Cons: ugly, can't go back to edit easily.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Second is using html <code>&lt;input type=""text""&gt;</code> fields.
<ul>
<li>Pros: can be styled, user can easily review and edit. Cons: a bit more coding needed.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>For the <code>prompt</code> method, collecting your strings is a doddle:</p>

<pre><code>var input = []; // initialise an empty array
var temp = '';
do {
    temp = prompt(""Enter a number. Press cancel or leave empty to finish."");
    if (temp === """" || temp === null) {
        break;
    } else {
        input.push(temp);  // the array will dynamically grow
    }
} while (1);
</code></pre>

<p><sub><em>(Yeah it's not the prettiest loop, but it's late and I'm tired....)</em></sub></p>

<p>The other method requires a bit more effort.</p>

<ol>
<li>Put a single input field on the page.</li>
<li>Add an <code>onfocus</code> handler to it.
<ol>
<li>Check if there is another input element after this one, and if there is, check if it's empty.
<ul>
<li>If there is, don't do anything.</li>
<li>Otherwise, create a new input, put it after this one and apply the same handler to the new input.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
<li>When the user clicks OK, loop through all the <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>s on the page and store them into an array.</li>
</ol>

<p>eg:</p>

<pre><code>// if you put your dynamic text fields in a container it'll be easier to get them
var inputs = document.getElementById('inputArea').getElementsByTagName('input');
var input = [];
for (var i = 0, l = inputs.length; i &lt; l; ++i) {
    if (inputs[i].value.length) {
        input.push(inputs[i].value);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>After that, regardless of your method of collecting the input, you can print the numbers back on screen in a number of ways. A simple way would be like this:</p>

<pre><code>var div = document.createElement('div');
for (var i = 0, l = input.length; i &lt; l; ++i) {
    div.innerHTML += input[i] + ""&lt;br /&gt;"";
}
document.body.appendChild(div);
</code></pre>

","9021","","<p>Try this:</p>

<pre><code>$row.find("" &gt; td:last &gt; span:first"").html()

<p>The first arrow in the <code>find()</code> means it will only look at immediate children of <code>$row</code> to find the last <code>&lt;td&gt;</code>.

$('&lt;div class=""input select""&gt;&lt;label for=""Gender""&gt;Gender&lt;/label&gt;').appendTo(...)

<p>If this is the case, replace the linebreaks with a space or with nothing:</p>

<pre><code>// change from this:
$('&lt;?php echo $form-&gt;input(""blah"", ...); ?&gt;').appendTo(...)

// to this:
$('&lt;?php echo str_replace(array(""\r\n"", ""\r"", ""\n""), """", $form-&gt;input(""blah"", ...)); ?&gt;')
    .appendTo(...)
</code></pre>

<p>... or if you want to keep the new lines, you'll need to escape them with a slash.</p>

<pre><code>// this gives ""Unterminated string literal""    
var x = 'abc
def';

// this gives you ""abcdef""
var x = 'abc\
def';

"<p>I'm writing myself a little game in JavaScript, using jQuery. The game has a board, with cells in it, much like Minesweeper: the user clicks a cell, and its data needs to be changed in some way. Each cell is presented by a simple image, but has some more data associated with it.</p>

<p>What I mostly need is, when the user clicks a cell, I have to somehow determine the row and column which was clicked, manipulate the data appropriately and change the view.</p>

<p>On one hand, setting the click handler on every individual cell seems like an overkill, but if you set the click handler on the whole table, it becomes PITA to determine which table cell was clicked. </p>

<p>How would you handle such a situation? Maybe there is a plugin already that can simplify the whole thing?</p>
","9021","","<p>This is a perfect example of a great use of the <code>live()</code> function. To find the x and y positions you just need to count the number of cells before or rows above this one:</p>

<pre><code>$('#minesweeperTable td').live('click', function() {
    var $this = $(this),
        xPos = $this.prevAll('td').length,
        yPos = $this.closest('tr').prevAll('tr').length
    ;
    // your code here
});
</code></pre>

<p>The best thing about this is that no matter how many cells you have, there's <em>only one event handler</em> which makes for <strong>much</strong> better performance.</p>

"<p>In trying to improve our Google Analytics data for our website, I created a piece of PHP code that would determine the server that the website is being served from, and only serve up the GA code when being run from our Production server. The code is below, and works as it should:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
switch( $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] ){
    case 'website.dev':
        echo '&lt;!-- local - no google tracking code --&gt;';
        break;
    case 'dev.website.com':
        echo '&lt;!-- dev - no google tracking code --&gt;';
        break;
    case 'test.website.com':
        echo '&lt;!-- test -no google tracking code --&gt;';
        break;
    default:
        require (""google-analytics.php"");
        break;
} ?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I had tried loading the analytics javascript with the require statement in a .js file, but the code wouldn't display for some reason. So I changed the name of the javascript file to .php, and it loads just fine (or so I thought). The code block above generates the desired results, and the code is only loaded when it is on our production server.</p>

<p>The problem is that since I've implemented this solution, our stats have dropped off a cliff. It's like the code isn't working. Analytics says that the code is installed fine, and I can see it in the raw HTML, but I suspect that it's not being run because it's being pulled in via a PHP page. </p>

<p>Anybody have any ideas?</p>
","9021","","<p>If it's in the HTML then PHP has done its job, and the browser doesn't care what generated the code.</p>

<p>Have you considered that between your local development servers, online dev servers and online test servers, you may have been generating all the traffic that you've now seen drop off the cliff?</p>

","9021","","<p>So do you actually have the string <code>'\n'</code> (not a new line character) on some lines? If so, you just need to escape the new line character:</p>

<pre><code>str_replace(""\\n"", ""*foo*"", $csv)

"<p>I am working on a jquery code that has a form </p>

<ul>
<li>country dropdown list</li>
<li>USA state dropdown list</li>
<li>non-usa state text input box</li>
</ul>

<p>The goal is to have a country dropdown,  </p>

<p>If a user selects USA then it will show the USA state list and hide the other state text input. </p>

<p>If a user selects a country other then the USA then it should HIDE the USA state list and show the state input text box </p>

<p>This almost works correctly with my code below except there is a problem.  </p>

<p>My code will hide the USA state dropdown list if you select a non-usa country.  However if you select the USA, it will show the state dropdown list which is great but it fails to hide the state text input box.  I cannot figure out why, I have posted a full example code working so you cann see the problem live if you care to look it is located here <a href=""http://jsbin.com/alige"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsbin.com/alige</a></p>

<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>PS) The reason for needing this extra code with the trigger change is because sometimes a user will already have a country/state saved into a database and when they load the page a country and state will be pre-selected so that bit of code makes sure it does not require a change/click to make it update on page load.</p>

","9021","","<p>It sounds like the server hasn't been set up to parse PHP yet.</p>

<p>Assuming you are using Apache, type this into a file:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php phpinfo(); ?&gt;

<p>And save it to a file called <code>info.php</code> (though you could name it anything) in your web root. By default (on windows) it will be <code>c:\program files\apache\htdocs</code> or something like that. Now access your file via the webserver by visiting <code>http://localhost/info.php</code>.</p>

<p>Note that you <em>must</em> access your PHP files this way, not by just double-clicking on a file on your computer (which will open <code>file:///C:/myfile.html</code> or something)</p>

<p>If you see this in your browser:</p>

<p><code>&lt;?php phpinfo(); ?&gt;</code></p>

<p>Then the file isn't being parsed by PHP. Read up on the installation documentation for Apache and PHP again, remembering that you'll probably have to restart the apache service after each change to its configuration.</p>

<p>If you see a big page listing a heap of configuration settings, then that's good! It means that PHP is working. Let us know if this is the case, so we can continue to help from there.</p>

","9021","","<p>If you provide a link to a file on the local file system (eg: <code>&lt;a href=""file:///C:/mydoc.doc""&gt;</code>) then the browser will open it - however this is not a great way to do it since the browser will first show a dialog (""Do you wish to Save or Open"") and then it will ""download"" it into temporary files as it would if the file were remote.

","9021","","<p>You are defining showMessage inside the second <code>document.ready</code> function and therefore it only has scope in that function (well, that's not strictly true, but it definitely doesn't have scope in the <em>other</em> document.ready function).</p>

<p>The solution is to move it to a scope which both functions can access. The easiest way to achieve this is to place it outside the other functions which gives it global scope.</p>

"<p>I'm working on a CakePHP project and am currently building the user authentication part of it. The problem is that my authentication information (ie: the passwords) are not stored in my database -- the authentication source is LDAP but my question applies equally to any non-database source.</p>

<p>It appears as though Cake only handles passwords when they exist in the local database. <a href=""http://book.cakephp.org/view/248/AuthComponent-Variables"" rel=""nofollow"">The Cake Cookbook suggests</a> that you can tell it a different controller/model/object to provide an authorization procedure by using the <code>$this-&gt;Auth-&gt;authorize</code> variable, however looking at the code (specifically <a href=""https://trac.cakephp.org/browser/tags/1.2.4.8284/cake/libs/controller/components/auth.php#L264"" rel=""nofollow"">the <code>Auth::startup()</code> function</a>) it looks like Cake will always try to query the database <strong>first</strong>, checking for a matching username/password, before then looking at the alternative object you specified with <code>Auth-&gt;authorize</code>. That is, changing <code>authorize</code> only adds a second-level filter, it doesn't replace the database lookup.</p>

<pre><code>// The process
1. User provides details
2. Cake checks the database
3. If OK, then check the custom object method
4. If OK, return true

// What I'd like:
1. User provides details.
2. Check the custom object method
3. If OK, return true
4. Profit.
</code></pre>

<p>Any ideas on how to do this, hopefully without hacking the core files?</p>
","9021","","<p>I was able to hack around the way Cake does it in a relatively dodgy, but probably acceptable way.</p>

<p>I added a ""password"" field onto my users table and set everyone's password to ""a"" (though you could use anything).</p>

<p>Then I added a custom hashing function into my model:</p>

<pre><code>function hashPasswords($data) {
    $data['User']['password'] = 'a';
    return $data;
}
</code></pre>

<p>And told my controller to use that model for hashing:</p>

<pre><code>$this-&gt;Auth-&gt;authenticate = ClassRegistry::init('User');
</code></pre>

<p>This means now that cake's first step will always pass (assuming the username exists in the table). The <code>authorize</code> function can now do its thing and do your proper check using whatever method you'd like.</p>

<p>It's basically changed the process to this:</p>

"<p>I have a field in a table which contains bitwise flags. Let's say for the sake of example there are three flags: <code>4 =&gt; read, 2 =&gt; write, 1 =&gt; execute</code> and the table looks like this<code>*</code>:</p>

<pre><code>  user_id  |  file  |  permissions
-----------+--------+---------------
        1  |  a.txt |  6    ( &lt;-- 6 = 4 + 2 = read + write)
        1  |  b.txt |  4    ( &lt;-- 4 = 4 = read)
        2  |  a.txt |  4
        2  |  c.exe |  1    ( &lt;-- 1 = execute)

<p>I'm interested to find all users who have a particular flag set (eg: write) on ANY record. To do this in one query, I figured that if you OR'd all the user's permissions together you'd get a single value which is the ""sum total"" of their permissions:</p>

","9021","","<p>You should be able to send 9 separate AJAX requests without hassle (assuming that a: each doesn't rely on the response of another, and b: this isn't something which happens all the time).</p>

<p>Looking further at it, the comments at the top of the DTD show they've considered people in your situation! The <code>glyph</code> attribute on the <code>&lt;symbol&gt;</code> tag is the standard HTML entity to use for that symbol, but with the ampersand replaced with an @.</p>

<pre><code>10 read xml document

echo $company-&gt;{'address-one'};  // ""3 Sesame St""
echo $company-&gt;address_one;    // ""3 Sesame St""

// works as expected if you somehow have both dashed and underscored var names
// pretend: $company-&gt;{'my-var'} ==&gt; ""dashed"", $company-&gt;my_var ==&gt; ""underscored""
echo $company-&gt;{'my-var'};  // ""dashed""
echo $company-&gt;my_var;    // ""underscored""

","9021","","<p>Your anonymous function there <em>does</em> have access to the <code>returnHtml</code> variable in its scope, and so the code there is actually working as you'd expect. Where you're probably going wrong is in your return statement.</p>

<p>Remember that the A in AJAX stands for asynchronous, which means that it doesn't happen at the same time. For that reason, the line <code>returnHtml = html</code> is actually happening <strong>after</strong> you call <code>return returnHtml;</code>, so <code>returnHtml</code> is still an empty string.</p>

<p>It's hard to say what you should do to get this working as you want without seeing the rest of your code, but what you could do is add another callback to the function:</p>

    function __set($var, $val) {
        throw new Exception(""Use set()!!"");
    }
    function set(FruityEnum &amp;$obj, $val) {
        $obj = new FruityEnum($val);
    }

    function __get($var) { //everything returns the value...
        return $this-&gt;value;
    }
    function __toString() {
        return $this-&gt;value;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And now to test it:</p>

<pre><code>function mutate(FruityEnum $obj) { // type hinting!
    $obj-&gt;set($obj, 'banana');
    return $obj;
}

$x = new FruityEnum('apple');
echo $x; // ""apple""
$y = mutate($x);
echo  $x // still ""apple""
    . $y // ""banana""
</code></pre>

<p>It works, but you have to use a strange way to change the object: </p>

<pre><code>$obj-&gt;set($obj, 'foo');
</code></pre>

<p>The only other way I could think to do it would be to use the <code>__set()</code> method, but that was even worse. You had to do this, which is bloody confusing.</p>

<pre><code>$obj = $obj-&gt;blah = 'foo';
</code></pre>

<p>In the end, it's probably easier to make the variables private and provide no mutators, so the only way to change a variable's ""enum"" value would be to create a new one:</p>

<pre><code>echo $obj; // ""banana""
$obj = new FruityEnum(""cantaloupe"");
</code></pre>

"<p>I've noticed a strange behaviour of the <code>live()</code> function in jQuery:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href=""#"" id=""normal""&gt;normal&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=""#"" id=""live""&gt;live&lt;/a&gt;

$('#normal').click(clickHandler);
$('#live').live('click', clickHandler);

function clickHandler() {
    alert(""Clicked"");
    return false;
}
</code></pre>

<p>That's fine and dandy until you right-click on the ""live"" link and it fires the handler, and then doesn't show the context menu. The event handler doesn't fire at all (as expected) on the ""normal"" link.</p>

<p>I've been able to work around it by changing the handler to this:</p>

<pre><code>function clickHandler(e) {
    if (e.button != 0) return true;
    // normal handler code here
    return false;
}
</code></pre>

<p>But that's really annoying to have to add that to all the event handlers. Is there any better way to have the event handlers only fire like regular click handlers?</p>
","9021","","<p>I've found a solution - ""fix"" the the <code>live()</code> code itself.</p>

<p>In the unminified source of jQuery 1.3.2 around line 2989 there is a function called <code>liveHandler()</code>. Modify the code to add one line:</p>

<pre><code>2989:    function liveHandler(event) {
2990:        if (event.type == 'click' &amp;&amp; event.button != 0) return true;
</code></pre>

<p>This will stop the click events from firing on anything but the left-mouse button. If you particularly wanted, you could quite easy modify the code to allow for ""rightclick"" events too, but this works for me so it's staying at that.</p>

"<p>I have a database at zoho creator. They feed me a json of the database content. I have trouble to parse and display that data with jquery or php or in html</p>

<p>Question : So how do I capture json data, and save (convert) it to file as XML. With the xml file I can parse it with jquery xpath easily... the ""file"" will be a local database, as a backup (if saved)</p>

<li>i can get help with any tutorial on
how to get xml data from zoho</li>
<li>any json to xml converter (jquery)
out there ?????</li>
</ol>
","9021","","<p>Firstly, Javascript has no file-output capability. The best it can do is send data back to a server for processing there -- so the ""capture json data, and save it to file as XML"" idea is out.</p>

<p>What problems in particular are you having with using JSON? As it gets converted to a native Javascript object, I find it quite easy to work with myself. Though, I can see that if you wanted to use XPath to query it, JSON is no help. You should still be able to get to whatever data you need, but it might be a bit more verbose.</p>

<p>In your example JSON:</p>

<pre><code>{""Liste_des_produits1"":[{""Added_Time"":""28-Sep-2009 16:35:03"",
""prod_ingredient"":""sgsdgds"",""prod_danger"":[""sans danger pour xyz""],""prod_odeur""..
</code></pre>

<p>You could access the <code>prod_danger</code> property like this:</p>

<pre><code>$.getJSON(url, function(data) {
   var danger = data.List_des_produits1[0].prod_danger; 
});
</code></pre>

<p>If you are having trouble getting the right path to a property, Firebug is a great help with this. Just call this:</p>

<pre><code>$.getJSON(url, function(data) {
    console.log(data);
});
</code></pre>

<p>...and then you can browse through its properties in a tree-structure.</p>

<p>If you look at this in Firebug (or Safari's inspect element), you'll see that the jQuery call is, in fact, changing the style of the #txn-41 div, but it's not changing in the browser.</p>

<p>Why isn't the #txn-41 div visible? The contents of it are visible, but I can't seem to apply effects to the parent!</p>

<p>Thanks for any assistance!</p>
","9021","","<p>It might be because all of its children divs are floated. Floating elements don't contribute to the height of their container (except in IE, I believe), so in your case, your <code>#txn-41</code> div probably has a height of 0.</p>

<p>If you add a ""clearing"" div as the last child that should solve it (if this is in fact the problem):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div style=""clear: both""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>There are also CSS methods which can do this automatically for you by adding content which clears the floats.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.positioniseverything.net/easyclearing.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Here's a good article explaining the problem</a> which also shows the CSS method for fixing it (no extra markup required). In short, add this to your <code>#txn-41</code> div:</p>

<pre><code>#txn-41:after {
    content: ""."";
    display: block;
    height: 0;
    clear: both;
    visibility: hidden;
}
</code></pre>

<p>(or make it a class)</p>

<p>I just read in <a href=""http://www.sitepoint.com/blogs/2005/02/26/simple-clearing-of-floats/"" rel=""nofollow"">this Sitepoint article</a> about several other methods for solving the problem, including the bizarrely simple method of merely declaring the outer containing div as having <code>overflow: auto</code>. Somehow, that works.</p>

"<p>I've got the following code that shows a lightbox 'please wait' box, then does a synchronous ajax request which removes the lightbox when it finishes.  Works fine everywhere else, but in IE, the lightbox doesn't show.  The Ajax request works fine, but it just seems to ignore the lightbox.</p>

<p>The <code>showLightbox</code> function just does that, show a modal lightbox with the passed in text.</p>

<pre><code>showLightbox(""Please Wait"");

$.ajax({
    async: true,
    dataType: 'json',
    type: 'GET',
    url: checkValidUrl,
    data: submitData,
    error: function(request, textStatus, errorThrown) {
    	valid = false;

    	valid=true;
    },
    complete: function(request, textStatus) {
    	hideLightbox();
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>If I make the ajax requst async it works fine, but I need it to be synchronous because this is a validation method.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Also, if I wrap the whole ajax request in a setTimeout it also works in IE, but that is asynchronous too</p>

<p><strong>Update 2</strong>: I just replaced the lightbox with a simple div and did a jQuery .show() on beforeSend and .hide() on complete, and it didn't show that either, so it doesn't seem to have anything to do with the lightbox.  If I whack an <code>alert()</code> immediately after <code>showLightbox()</code> it does show the lightbox</p>
","9021","","<p>This smells funny.</p>

<p>Firstly, I can't think of any good reason for using a synchronous request -- doing so locks the user's browser until the response is returned. It's a terrible user experience which would make most users think your website is killing their browser.</p>

<p>Secondly, you say you're doing this for validation? Any user who is malicious enough to try to alter a form while they wait for the asynchronous response would also be smart enough to just change your ""async: false"" to ""async: true"". Remember that all validation on the client side is <em>only</em> there for the benefit of the user, and all proper validation should be done server-side. I don't see why you'd need to do things this way.</p>

"<p>How long is too long for an attribute value in HTML?</p>

<p>I'm using HTML5 style data attributes (<code>data-foo=""bar""</code>) in a new application, and in one place it would be really handy to store a fair whack of data (upwards of 100 characters). While I suspect that this amount is fine, it raises the question of how much is too much?</p>

","9021","","<p>I would get your PHP to return all the newly inserted values with the json response. It looks like you're already half doing that (with <code>$data['add']</code>), but I'd do it in a slightly different way:</p>

<pre><code>$data['id'] = mysql_insert_id();

$response['success'] = true;
$response['message'] = ""Woohoo"";
$response['data'] = $data;

echo json_encode($response);
</code></pre>

<p>This way, you get this in your Javascript:</p>

<pre><code>{
    success : true,
    message : 'Woohoo',
    data : {
        id : 15,
        add : 'foo'
    }
}

    if (data.success) {
        $(""ul.list"").append(
            $(""&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;"")
                .html(""id: "" + data.data.id + "", add: "" + data.data.add)

","9021","","<p>So, breaking into steps -- you want to find all your friends, and then you want to find all of their friends. These are the two parts of your query (and subquery):</p>

<p>This is how you'd get a list of all your friends</p>

FROM tbl_friendlist
WHERE f.mem_id = 1

    FROM tbl_friendlist f2
    WHERE f2.mem_id = 1

    FROM tbl_friendlist f2

"<p>I posted another <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1527730/where-to-put-javascript-configuration-functions"">question</a> on a very similar topic, but turned out to be a little subjective.  I am able to divided the question in two questions, one that I will explain below:</p>

<p>In the following Code:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
$(function() 
{
   $(""#accordion"").accordion();
   $(""#datepicker"").datepicker();
   $(""#button"").click(function() 
   {
     runEffect();
     return false;
   });
});
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Question: If I have this code called in a 1,000 pages, but only 250 pages have a datepicker id.  Will the browser spend extra time on the other 750 pages trying to parse for id datepicker, or Jquery has a smart way of solving this situation without affecting performance?</p>

<p>What happen if the code is making reference to ids or classes that does not exist on the html markup of the current page, will that impact performance? </p>
","9021","","<p>The code will be called on every single page load and the execution would go something like this:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>$(""#accordion"").accordion()</code>
<ol>
<li>Find matching elements:
<ol>
<li><code>""#accordion""</code> ID lookup is very fast</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Apply function to all matching elements:
<ul>
<li>if there was no #accordion element, then it's going to return virtually instantly without doing anything</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<p>You'd only want to worry about it in two cases, IMO:</p>

<ol>
<li>You have a very complex selector.</li>
<li>You are calling a lot of functions on the element.</li>
</ol>

<p>In case 2, which is much more common, I work around it by doing this:</p>

<pre><code>$el = $('#myElement');
if ($el.length) {
    $el
        .find(""div"")
        .each(function () { .. })
        .parents()
    // etc...
}
</code></pre>

<p>I've just put together a benchmark to test how much effect this actually has. You can <a href=""http://jsbin.com/uyajo"" rel=""nofollow"">see the results</a> and <a href=""http://jsbin.com/uyajo/edit"" rel=""nofollow"">the code</a> if you like:</p>

<p>In short:</p>

<pre><code>// doing this:
var $f = $('#fakeElement');
if ($f.length) $f.find('div');

// is almost twice as fast as this:
$('#fakeElement').find('div');

// For 10000 iterations, 404ms vs 788ms in my tests

<p>~ Justin</p>
","9021","","<p>With jQuery, you can generally avoid inserting any javascript into your HTML at all, eg: <code>href=""javascript: ...""</code> or <code>href=""#"" onclick=""...""</code>. A neater way is to write a query to target that element and apply the behaviour from there. The simplest way to target the element is to give it an ID, but you could use any method you like.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href=""#"" id=""myLink""&gt;Click!&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and your jQuery:</p>

<pre><code>$('#myLink').click(function() {
    $(this).after(""&lt;div&gt;hello world!&lt;/div&gt;"");
});
</code></pre>

<p>Inside the <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Events"" rel=""nofollow"">event handling functions</a>, <code>this</code> refers to the DOM element that was targeted by the event.</p>

<p>If you want to get a jQuery object from an element - just pass it to the constructor:</p>

<pre><code>$(domElement)
</code></pre>

<p>You might be having issues because of the way you're calling the handler. Try changing your link to this style:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href=""#"" onclick=""doSomething(this)""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Just remember to make <code>doSomething()</code> return false</p>

","9021","","<p>When you're talking about time periods like hours, minutes and seconds, then that's not even anything to do with timezones. Look at the timestamp of when it was created, and look at the timestamp now. Do some subtraction and voila!</p>

<p>The only time it's slightly strange is when you are in the range of a couple of days. Does yesterday mean ""some time in the 24 hours prior to the last midnight"", or does it mean ""over 24 hours ago""? In any case, if the only level of granularity you are providing is ""days"", then once it's gone past about 2 days, then it doesn't really matter.</p>

<p>One nice way to avoid confusion is the same method used here on SO: put the readable, friendly date on the screen (""yesterday""), but put the exact time (in GMT or in the user's TZ) as a tooltip.</p>

<p>To loop through an array which doesn't have sequential (or even numeric) keys, you can use a couple of methods, but the easiest one is <code>foreach</code>. There are two forms of the <code>foreach</code> loop:</p>

<pre><code>$array = array(1=&gt;0, 2=&gt;34, 6=&gt;67, 15=&gt;56);

// the first form:
foreach ($array as $value) {
    echo $value;    // ""0"", ""34"", ""67"", ""56""
}

// the second form:
foreach ($array as $key =&gt; $value) {
    echo $key . "","" . $value;    // 1,0 2,34 6,67 15,56

","9021","","<p>Inside the function provided to <code>each</code>, <code>this</code> refers to the current element. Try this:</p>

<pre><code>$.each(result.GroupList, function() {
    $('#myTable &gt; tbody').append(
        '&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'
        + this.userName

        + this.count +
        '&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;'
    );
});
</code></pre>

<p>If that doesn't work for you, it may have something to do with this: <code>$('#myTable &gt; tbody')</code>, considering that there is no <code>tbody</code> element. I believe that Internet Explorer will automatically create one but the other browsers won't. Check <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Utilities/jQuery.support""><code>$.support.tbody</code></a> to see if the browser does that for you. </p>

<p>It always displays the element at top even if scrolled, but the text-align:center doesn't work at all. </p>

<p>Anyone has any idea how to move this element to the center of the screen?</p>

<p>Thanks a lot!</p>
","9021","","<p>When you change an element's position to <code>fixed</code>, it will no longer fill horizontally like a normal block level element (div, p, etc). Without a specified <code>width</code> parameter, it will only be as wide as it needs to be. Since your block is only as wide as the text, changing the text alignment won't change the appearance, since it's already flush to the left and right, if you get my meaning...</p>

<p>One way you can get around this is to specify the width, however this might be problematic, since you don't know the width of the browser window. A much neater way (which might not work cross-browser, I'm not sure), is to also specify the <code>right</code>:</p>

<pre><code>position: fixed;
left: 5px;
right: 5px;
text-align: center;
</code></pre>

<p>This will make the block fill the window horizontally leaving 5px on either side. Text alignment should work then.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: I just tested and this works in Firefox and Internet Explorer 7. Try it out here: <a href=""http://jsbin.com/ihofa"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsbin.com/ihofa</a></p>

"<p>I am new to javascript, so excuse my lack of actual code.</p>

<p>I have a block of text that I want to fit into a space. I want to break it into rows. I need to find where the newlines are to add a new line and some offset. Then I want to subtract the offset from the row word length (if needed) and get a new cycle until there is something to do.</p>

<p>I was actually hoping to get an answer on the splitting on newlines, or at least finding out how long a row is by pixels.</p>
","9021","","<p>As far as I am aware, the only way to check the width of some text is to render that text in a hidden element and then check the width of that element. Continue doing this until you get the longest string which is less than your desired maximum width. Rinse and repeat.</p>

<p>I assume that you're trying to fit your text into an arbitrary/irregular shape: if it's just a rectangle, then of course, you could just set the width of a container element.</p>

"<p>I've constructed a form, but some rows of the form can potentially be returned blank, with default values. I'm trying to find a way of searching the form output and then deleting the bit which I know is not needed - which looks like:</p>

&lt;td&gt;2E&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td id=""8003""&gt;-800&lt;/td&gt;

<p>I've used str_replace() effectively on a couple of bits, but my major problem is that bgcolor=""#FFFFFF"" can CHANGE to different hex values and also 

<p>I could write a str_replace() for every possible outcome I guess, but is there a preg_replace solution for anything like this? It would have to be a pretty complicated regular expression.</p>
","9021","","<p>A regex to match hexadecimal strings is actually quite easy:</p>

<pre><code>/[0-9a-fA-F]+/
</code></pre>

<p>You'll probably hear that you should use a HTML parser to remove the unwanted nodes - maybe you should, but if you <em>know</em> what the input string is going to be like, then maybe not.</p>

<p>To match that first line in your example, you'd need this regex:</p>

<pre><code>preg_replace(""/&lt;tr bgcolor=\""#[0-9a-fA-F]+\""&gt;/"", '', $string)

"<p>Could somebody explain me how to store a escaped string in a column limited in size of a mysql table. I mean, if I have a column to which I define a size (let's say varchar(10)), if I insert ""abcdefghij"" the limit is reached, but if I insert ""abcde'ghij"" I exceed the limit since the escaped result of this last string is ""abcde\'ghij"" although the original size is 10! How to control this?</p>
","9021","","<p>There's often a lot of confusion around string escaping and how the escape characters work. For example, given this PHP code:</p>

<pre><code>$string = ""My \""string\"" is cool."";
</code></pre>

<p>The variable <code>$string</code> <strong>does not contain any slashes</strong>. The code I wrote there has some slashes in it, but they exist only for the benefit of the parser, to tell it that the following quote mark shouldn't end the string.</p>

<p>The same applies for databases, but this is where a lot of people trip up, because you often build a string which is read by 2 parsers, firstly your programming language (eg: PHP), and then by the database. For example, to insert the string <code>""""</code> (two quote marks, not an empty string) into the database, you'd need some code which looked like this:</p>

<pre><code>$sql = ""INSERT INTO myTable VALUES (\""\\\""\\\""\"")"";
</code></pre>

<p>PHP reads this and interprets the string to be this:</p>

<pre><code>INSERT INTO myTable VALUES (""\""\"""")
</code></pre>

<p>And then MySQL reads that and interprets the insert value as:</p>

<pre><code>""""
</code></pre>

<p><em>(two quotes)</em></p>

<p>Now that that is all sorted, what about the problem at hand? You say you have an escaped string? That's a problem. <strong>You should only escape a string as you need to, at the very last moment.</strong> If the data you want to store is <code>5 o'clock</code>, then the value of the string should be <code>5 o'clock</code>, <em>not</em> <code>5 o\'clock</code></p>

<p>When you are inserting that value into an SQL statement, that's the moment when you need to escape it.</p>

<pre><code>$myString = '5 o\'clock';   // value is: 5 o'clock
$sql = sprintf(
    ""INSERT INTO myTable VALUES ('%s')"",
    mysql_real_escape_string($myString)   // 5 o\'clock

","9021","","<p>First of all, I have to say that nested tables are 100% awful. Please reconsider your design.</p>

<pre><code>$(""table.Newuser &gt; tbody &gt; tr:eq(1) table td:eq(0)"").addClass(""buttonClose"")
</code></pre>

<p>To select the first row of the Newuser table, you need to use these <code>&gt;</code> children rules, including the <code>tbody</code>, otherwise the ""second <code>tr</code>"" is actually the first <code>tr</code> of the table in the first row, if you know what I mean.</p>

<p>Some browsers add a <code>&lt;tbody&gt;</code> element automatically to tables without them, others don't, and I think this query might not work in those browsers. You should always add a tbody element to your tables. (And never nest them, either!!)</p>

"<p>One business goal requires that I make a form on screen that's pixel-perfect.

<p><strong>I'm leaning towards HTML/CSS, and would like suggestions on tools to assist that.</strong></p>

"<p>I am coming from a C++ background and am used to testing code by setting breakpoints, viewing variables in the debugger etc.</p>

<p>I am now doing web development (using the symfony framework). what I really miss is not being able to set a breakpoint when a particular action is performed (e.g. a url clicked etc). Is there a FREE (GPL or other license) PHP IDE that can allow me to set breakpoints etc as described above?</p>

<p>Summary: Job needed to write a web app as a support tool. I begrudgingly took the task up to learn a bit of web stuff to implement a snazzy UI. (I come from a computer hardware background with all low level imperative stuff) I saw a jQuery UI demo and also came across an ""ajax for dummies"" guide pointing to jQuery, so I told myself I'd learn the minimum needed to do my damn job, but that would be it.</p>

<p>I bought the Jonathan Chaffer book Learning jQuery 1.3 and read the minimum needed to make my app work, but I was bothered that I didn't really understand the anonymous functions used, first class objects, etc. I did get an eyebrow raise from the interesting appendix on closures, and began thinking ""hmm, that's cool..."" So I bought the giant O'Reilly Definitive Guide and read through it. Wanted to know more, so I got the Douglas Crockford book (JS: The Good Parts) and went through his website - wow now I just blew away my previous understanding of JS prototypal inheritance (I was doing it the new() way) and damn, design patterns and unit testing frameworks in this language too? Javascript really must be more serious than I thought! With this newfound background I'm going through the jQuery library and dissecting its guts.</p>

<p>I don't know where to go from here though. Ideas I have but am not sure how to go about exploring include:</p>

<ol>
<li>Get more into JS' integration into web architecture. I've only been doing basic XHRs, to serialize a few variables and do a GET to retrieve DB stored information, did XML->JSON conversion and back. But there's probably much, much more to make a app like gmail. Where to start?</li>
<li>Graphics and animations seem interesting. Saw some really cool demos from Google I/O 2009. I don't have a graphics background though so I'd need tips on where to start with the theory. I also don't know where JS' graphics capabilities overlap with Flash</li>

<p>In Javascript, you escape quotes with a backslash. This is so that when javascript interprets the string it knows where it ends.</p>

<pre><code>var name = 'O\'Reilly';
</code></pre>

<p>In HTML, you use ampersands and a character code.</p>

<pre><code>O&amp;quot;Reilly
</code></pre>

<p>Just remember that when you are writing code in your HTML, <strong>it's not being interpreted by javascript, it's being interpreted by the HTML parser</strong>. To a HTML parser, a backslash is just a regular character.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a onclick=""foo(&amp;quot;bar&amp;quot;);""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now you see why I'd recommend avoiding the situation in the first place. Here's the alternative:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a id=""myLink""&gt;

&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
    document.getElementById('myLink').onclick = function() {
        foo('bar');
    };
&lt;/script&gt;

"<p>What I'm trying to do involves going through a series of checkboxes.</p>

<p>For each one of them that it is checked, I have to perform some calculations (using an ajax call). If there is an error, I have to break the loop and return a message.</p>

<p>Every ajax call takes about 0,4 seconds to perform but that shall never be a problem because I can only have a maximum of 4 of them checked at any given time.</p>

<p>But the problem I'm facing is that, the final alert box pops-up before the one inside the error function(). The error function does work but it appears always after the final one.</p>

<p>I was under the impression that by defining the call as asynchronous=false, code execution would wait until the call returned a response. Is that a wrong assumption? </p>

<p>Is there a way to accomplish this?</p>

","9021","","<p>As mentioned in the <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Ajax/jQuery.ajax#options"" rel=""nofollow"">manual</a>, the <code>error</code> function is...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A function to be called if the request fails.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is, if there's a communication problem between the client and the server (eg: timeout, no authorisation, etc). It's not called when your server-side script returns a value which in your application is considered an error. Move that code into <code>success</code>, and check the response data to see how your script treated each request.</p>

<p>Also, I should mention that you would need to have <strong>really</strong> good reasons to use synchronous calls. Yes, in your testing it only takes 1.5 seconds, but what happens when someone has a slow connection, or your server is under heavy load or unavailable? Synchronous requests freeze the client's browser (that is, not even things like changing tabs or scrolling works) and make for a <em>very</em> bad user experience. If you do want to block the UI on your page, there's plenty of friendlier ways to do it. For example, check out <a href=""http://www.malsup.com/jquery/block/"" rel=""nofollow"">BlockUI</a>.</p>

<p>It is much better to use callbacks and start thinking asynchronously, rather than procedurally. It's a bit of a struggle when you first start (since your code isn't necessarily run in line-by-line order), but it is very powerful and flexible once you get the hang of it.</p>

"<p>My page contains some drag-able <code>div</code> elements ( <strong>not</strong> jQuery UI dragable ).</p>

<p>Now we want to add a new feature: the user should be able to select more than one <code>div</code> at a time and drag these <code>div</code> elements without triggering the previous bound events.</p>

<p>Now here is my problem:</p>

<p>Is it possible to disable the <code>mousedown</code>, <code>mousemove</code> and <code>mouseup</code> event of each <code>div</code> as long as they are part of a selection?</p>

<p>So basically I want to <strong>replace</strong> the <strong>old event</strong> by a new one and <strong>afterwards restoring</strong> the original events.</p>

<p>Thanks for your time</p>

<p>Update:</p>

<p>I wrote a tiny script to test <code>stopImmediatePropagation</code></p>

<p><a href=""http://jsbin.com/odafi"" rel=""nofollow"">jsBin demo</a></p>

<p>With the following code:</p>

<pre><code>$(""p"").click(function(event){

});

$(""a"").click( function()
{

   $(""p"").click(function(event){
     event.stopImmediatePropagation();
     alert ( ' I am the new event ' );
   });


return false;
});
</code></pre>

<p>It does not work as <code>event.stopImmediatePropagation();</code> is called after the first event.
So the out put is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am the old event</p>
  
  <p>I am the new event</p>
</blockquote>
","9021","","<p>You could take a look at <code>event.stopImmediatePropagation()</code>.</p>

<p>See here in the <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Events/jQuery.Event#event.stopImmediatePropagation.28.29"" rel=""nofollow"">jQuery docs</a></p>

<p>Basically you make one function optionally block the other functions from running - you don't need to remove and rebind the functions.</p>

"<p>I've stopped receiving error messages in my CakePHP app. Normally error messages are suppressed if you have debug set to 0; if it is 1 or 2 then you get the error message, (plus stack trace, etc.) But I don't get anything if there is an error, regardless of my debug setting. So if I introduce an error (syntax, logic, whatever) all I get is a blank page, with no indication of line number or anything.

<p>A better approach if you're set on avoiding incrementing IDs would be to use a GUID, or just a random value when you create the ID.</p>

<p>That said, if your application security relies on people not guessing an ID, that shows some flaws elsewhere in the system. My advice: stick to the plain and easy auto-incrementing ID and apply some proper access control.</p>

<p>Any language would work, but it should be portable.</p>
","9021","nickf","<p>Though this doesn't answer your question exactly, here's one way to generate every permutation of the letters from a number of strings of the same length: eg, if your words were ""coffee"", ""joomla"" and ""moodle"", you can expect output like ""coodle"", ""joodee"", ""joffle"", etc.</p>

<p>Basically, the number of combinations is the (number of words) to the power of (number of letters per word). So, choose a random number between 0 and the number of combinations - 1, convert that number to base (number of words), then use each digit of that number as the indicator for which word to take the next letter from.</p>

<p>eg: in the above example. 3 words, 6 letters = 729 combinations. Choose a random number: 465. Convert to base 3: 122020. Take the first letter from word 1, 2nd from word 2, 3rd from word 2, 4th from word 0... and you get... ""joofle"".</p>

<p>If you wanted all the permutations, just loop from 0 to 728. Of course, if you're just choosing one random value, a much <strike>simpler</strike> less-confusing way would be to loop over the letters. This method lets you avoid recursion, should you want all the permutations, plus it makes you look like you know Maths<sup>(tm)</sup>!</p>

<p>If the number of combinations is excessive, you can break it up into a series of smaller words and concatenate them at the end.</p>

"<p>I'm taking my first crack at Ajax with jQuery. I'm getting my data onto my page, but I'm having some trouble with the JSON data that is returned for Date data types. Basically, I'm getting a string back that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>/Date(1224043200000)/
</code></pre>

<p>From someone totally new to JSON - How do I format this to a short date format? Should this be handled somewhere in the jQuery code? I've tried the <code>jQuery.UI.datepicker</code> plugin using <code>$.datepicker.formatDate()</code> without any success.</p>

<p>FYI: Here's the solution I came up with using a combination of the answers here:</p>

<pre><code>function getMismatch(id) {
  $.getJSON(""Main.aspx?Callback=GetMismatch"", 
    { MismatchId: id },

    function (result) {
      $(""#AuthMerchId"").text(result.AuthorizationMerchantId);
      $(""#SttlMerchId"").text(result.SettlementMerchantId);
      $(""#CreateDate"").text(formatJSONDate(Date(result.AppendDts)));
      $(""#ExpireDate"").text(formatJSONDate(Date(result.ExpiresDts)));
      $(""#LastUpdate"").text(formatJSONDate(Date(result.LastUpdateDts)));
      $(""#LastUpdatedBy"").text(result.LastUpdateNt);
      $(""#ProcessIn"").text(result.ProcessIn);
    }
  );

  return false;
}

function formatJSONDate(jsonDate) {
  var newDate = dateFormat(jsonDate, ""mm/dd/yyyy"");
  return newDate;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This solution got my object from the callback method and displayed the dates on the page properly using the date format library.</p>

<p>Using jQuery, you can access your data object this way:</p>

<pre><code>$.get(
    ""myJSONFile.php"",
    function (data) {
        // data.myDate will be a date object.

        // to show in a short date format (eg: dd/mm/yyyy)
        alert (
            data.myDate.getDate() + ""/""
            + (data.myDate.getMonth() + 1) + ""/""
            + data.myDate.getFullYear()

"<p>Mine would have to be the float and margin bugs...</p>

<p>If you float an element, and then specify a margin for it, it will double the margin.</p>

<p>The solution to this is to add <code>display: inline</code> to the element. This will stop the double margin, and all other browsers will ignore it because only block level objects can be floated.</p>

"<p>I really don't understand what the problem is with those people who ask you not to use JavaScript on your site. </p>

<p><img src=""http://www.beholdgenealogy.com/img/no_javascript.gif"" alt=""Why the paranoia?""></p>

<p>I went through all sorts of trouble trying to remove a couple of JavaScript scripts I used on one of my sites <a href=""http://groups.google.com/group/soc.genealogy.computing/browse_thread/thread/fc76732425d5f24f"">to appease a couple of ""complainers""</a>. A month later, after a relentless attack by spam bots, I decided I better add the JavaScript spam prevention code back in.</p>

<p>JavaScript is obviously used by a lot of programmers. It is currently the 6th most popular tag here at Stack Overflow. It is used on practically every single website that I know of. </p>

<p>The claim that it is a security risk seems bogus to me. I've had JavaScript on in my browser for as long as I remember, and not once have I found out that anything malicious has happened.</p>

<p>JavaScript has, of course, been extended into AJAX. And AJAX is the thing that makes the wonderful world of Web 2.0 work. And that includes this wonderful Stack Overflow site.</p>

<p>So is there something I'm missing? Is there something wrong with JavaScript that I'm not aware of?</p>

<hr>

<p>Follow-up:</p>

<p>I am flabbergasted by the response to my Question.</p>

<p>The responses are strong and vociferous from the Anti-JavaScript people.</p>

<p>There was one pro-JavaScript comment, and it was voted down (as I write this to -2) by the others.</p>

<p>I turned JavaScript off to add this follow-up. I immediately notice three obvious things (There might be more):</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A big annoying white on red banner at the top of each page saying: ""Stack Overflow works best with JavaScript enabled"". (Annoyance) </p></li>
<li><p>Comments cannot be viewed at all or added. You can't vote up or vote down. You can't select the accepted answer. (Loss of functionality)</p></li>
<li><p>Of course none of the AJAX stuff works. I don't have access to the line of editing tools above this entry box, and I can't see the preview as I type this. (Inconveniences)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So as far as I am concerned, turning your JavaScript off results in Annoyances, Loss of Functionality, and Inconvenience.</p>

<p>I'm sorry for the handicapped people who have no JavaScript support, but I still don't get why so many of you are so religiously against using it. </p>

<p>Personally, I love what AJAX and its beautiful interfaces and enhanced functionality are doing to the Web. I try to add such features to my site and it annoys me when the Anti-JavaScript people ask me - no, demand of me to take it out because they can't access them. </p>

<p>But how many of you use Stack Overflow with JavaScript off? None I would expect. Your answer would be that you turn it on for sites you trust like Stack Overflow.</p>

<p>Okay. If I make a site that uses Ajax or JavaScript, then I'm fine with you turning it off until you decide to trust my site. But don't expect me to be required to give you all the functionality that I do to people who trust me. Even Stack Overflow doesn't. </p>

<p>If someone wants to embellish this idea, I'll give them the accepted answer.</p>

<p>Followup.  I found the following opinion about JavaScript at the <a href=""http://www.polepositionmarketing.com/library/wp-spamfree/#wpsf_how_it_works"">WP-SpamFree WordPress Plugin page</a>:</p>

<p>""Most of the spam hitting your blog originates from bots. Few bots can process JavaScript. Few bots can process cookies. Fewer still, can handle both. In a nutshell, this plugin uses a combo of JavaScript and cookies (on steroids) to weed out the humans from spambots, preventing 99%+ of automated spam from ever getting to your site. Almost 100% of web site visitors will have these turned on by default, so this type of solution works silently in the background, with no inconveniences. There are extremely few users (less than 2%) that have JavaScript and/or cookies turned off by default, but they will be prompted to turn those back on to post their comment.</p>

<p>Stats show that among all Internet users, less than 2% have JavaScript turned off, and less than 1% have cookies turned off. This requirement isn’t anything out of the ordinary because most modern websites require the use of JavaScript and cookies for key features — AJAX, for example, won’t work if JS is disabled.</p>

<p><strong>Overall, the very few that might be inconvenienced because they have JS and cookies turned off will be far fewer than the 100% who would be annoyed by CAPTCHA’s, challenge questions, and other validation methods.</strong>""</p>

"<p>I'm looking for the coolest thing you can do in a few lines of simple code.  I'm sure you can write a <a href=""http://mcfunley.com/cs/blogs/dan/archive/2007/12/25/1532.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">Mandelbrot set in Haskell in 15 lines</a> but it's difficult to follow. </p>

<p><strong>My goal is to inspire students that programming is cool</strong>. </p>

<p>We <em>know</em> that programming is cool because you can create anything you imagine - it's the ultimate creative outlet.  I want to inspire these beginners and get them over as many early-learning humps as I can.</p>

<p>Now, my reasons are selfish.  I'm teaching an <em>Intro to Computing</em> course to a group of 60 half-engineering, half business majors; all freshmen.  They are the students who came from underprivileged High schools.  From my past experience, the group is generally split as follows: a few <a href=""http://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=Rockstar%2BProgrammers&amp;fp=WnpED7D%5FIvM"" rel=""nofollow"">rock-stars</a>, some who try very hard and <em>kind of</em> get it, the few who try very hard and <em>barely</em> get it, and the few who don't care.  I want to reach as many of these groups as effectively as I can. Here's an example of how I'd use a computer program to teach:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here's an example of what I'm looking
  for:  a 1-line VBS script to get your
  computer to talk to you:</p>

<pre><code>CreateObject(""sapi.spvoice"").Speak InputBox(""Enter your text"",""Talk it"")
</code></pre>
  
  <p>I could use this to demonstrate order
  of operations.  I'd show the code, let
  them play with it, then explain that
  There's a lot going on in that line,
  but the computer can make sense of it,
  because it knows the rules.  Then I'd
  show them something like this:</p>

<pre><code>4(5*5) / 10 + 9(.25 + .75)
</code></pre>
  
  <p>And you can see that first I need to
  do is (5*5).  Then I can multiply for
  4.  And now I've created the Object.  Dividing by 10 is the same as calling
  Speak - I can't Speak before I have an
  object, and I can't divide before I
  have 100.  Then on the other side I
  first create an InputBox with some
  instructions for how to display it. 
  When I hit enter on the input box it
  evaluates or ""returns"" whatever I
  entered.  (Hint: 'oooooo' makes a
  funny sound)  So when I say Speak, the
  right side is what to Speak.  And I
  get that from the InputBox.</p>
  
  <p>So when you do several things on a
  line, like:</p>

<pre><code>x = 14 + y;
</code></pre>
  
  <p>You need to be aware of the order of
  things.  First we add 14 and y.  Then
  we put the result (what it evaluates
  to, or returns) into x.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's my goal, to have a bunch of these cool examples to demonstrate and teach the class while they have fun.  I tried this example on my roommate and while I may not use this as the first lesson, she liked it and learned something.</p>

<p>Some cool <a href=""http://reference.wolfram.com/legacy/v5/Tour/WritingProgramsInMathematica.html"" rel=""nofollow"">mathematica programs that make beautiful graphs or shapes</a> that are easy to understand would be good ideas and I'm going to look into those.  Here are some <a href=""http://www.25lines.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">complicated actionscript examples</a> but that's a bit too advanced and I can't teach flash.  What other ideas do you have?</p>
","9021","","<ul>
<li>Choose any language (or framework) where drawing a dot, line, box or circle to the screen is trivial. Designing games is where <a href=""http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000669.html"" rel=""nofollow"">a lot of programmers first find their passion</a>, and graphical output is fundamental to this.</li>
<li>Choose a language which lets them easily show off their work to friends. If they need to get their friends to install runtime frameworks and follow complicated instructions to show off, then they won't be getting the necessary kudos and comments they need. Don't underestimate the value of a peer saying <em>""Hey, that's cool!""</em> </li>
</ul>

<p>Perhaps given these two criteria, Javascript with <a href=""http://processingjs.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">Processing.js</a> or Flash might be a good start point, though Flash obviously has the downside of requiring.. er... Flash.</p>

","9021","","<p>One method, as mentioned by Zoidberg, is to put a random number (or the current time, etc) at the end of the url. However, you probably don't want the clients to never cache it. Caches, used properly, are beautiful things.</p>

<p>Does anyone know why jQuery.Load() removes the BODY tag? And are there any workarounds?</p>
","9021","","<p>It probably removes the <code>body</code> tag because it's not allowed! Each document can only have one body. Rather than force everyone to redo all their HTML pages, jQuery probably just grabs the contents of the <code>body</code> to use when you call <code>load()</code>.</p>

","9021","","<p>I would stick to keeping all the tables together, otherwise there's barely any point to using a single database.

<p>When it comes to here, it will evaluate the contents of the brackets before passing them to the <code>setTimeout</code> function, just as it would if you typed <code>function(3 + 2)</code>. If you want that to run after one second, you can pass it an actual function like this:</p>

<p>How can I do this in PHP?</p>
","9021","","<p>Don't fall into the trap of using date functions for this! What you have here is a time interval, not a date. The naive approach is to do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>date(""h:i:s.u"", $mytime / 1000)
</code></pre>

<p>but because the date function is used for (gasp!) dates, it doesn't handle time the way you would want it to in this situation - it takes timezones and daylight savings, etc, into account when formatting a date/time.</p>

<p>Instead, you will probably just want to do some simple maths:</p>

<pre><code>$input = 70135;

$uSec = $input % 1000;
$input = floor($input / 1000);

$seconds = $input % 60;
$input = floor($input / 60);

$input = floor($input / 60);

<pre><code>var date = new Date(myStr.replace(

    '$4:$5:$6 $2/$3/$1'

<p><strong>Explanation of the original method :</strong> </p>

<pre><code>// EDIT: this doesn't work! see below.
var date = Date.apply(
    null,
    myStr.match(/^(\d{4})(\d\d)(\d\d)(\d\d)(\d\d)(\d\d)$/).slice(1)

<p>The <code>match()</code> function (after it has been <code>slice()</code>d to contain just the right) will return an array containing year, month, day, hour, minute, and seconds. This just happens to be the exact right order for the Date constructor. <code>Function.apply</code> is a way to call a function with the arguments in an array, so I used <code>Date.apply(&lt;that array&gt;)</code>.</p>

<p>for example:</p>

<pre><code>var foo = function(a, b, c) { };

foo('A', 'B', 'C')

var arr = ['A', 'B', 'C'];
foo.apply(null, arr);

<p>I've just now realised that this function doesn't actually work, since javascript months are zero-indexed. You could still do it in a similar method, but there'd be an intermediate step, subtracting one from the array before passing it to the constructor. I've left it here, since it was asked about in the comments.</p>

","9021","","<p><strong>Is there any difference?</strong></p>

<p>If it's placed at the very end of your document, then in most cases, they'll be the same. The problem with the first method is that it is run as soon as it is encountered and the document waits for it to complete.</p>

<p><strong>Where should scripts be placed?</strong></p>

<p>The <a href=""http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html#js%5Fbottom"" rel=""nofollow"">general recommendation</a> is that they are placed at the end of the document, <em>inside</em> the body. The spec doesn't allow for anything except <code>head</code> and <code>body</code> to be directly inside the <code>html</code> tag.</p>

<p>The reason for this recommendation is that since almost all your javascript is going to be run after the document has finished loading, there's no point loading until the very end. If you put it at the start of your document, in the head, then the browser has to download all your scripts before it even gets to the content, meaning the user has to sit looking at a blank page for slightly longer.</p>

<p><strong>Recommendations:</strong></p>

<p>If you're using any of the common javascript toolkits/libraries around these days, they'll often have their own construct for specifying some code to run once the page is ready. In jQuery for example, it's this:</p>

<pre><code>$(function() {  /* code here */ });
</code></pre>

<p>Also, good use of javascript packing/minification, caching and gzipping on the server-side will minimise the negatives of putting the scripts up in the head where they are usually placed. Still, it doesn't hurt to chuck it at the end.</p>

","9021","","<p>The best solution is to not use some dummy placeholder at all. Use a meaningful URL which, if the link were actually followed, would show you the information you'd get from the AJAX request. </p>

<p>I do this regularly with my web apps, using Javascript to enhance a working site. For example, the HTML:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href=""/users/index"" rel=""popup""&gt;View users&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The Javascript (jQuery):</p>

<pre><code>$('a[rel*=""popup""]').click(function() {
    loadPopup({    // whatever your favourite lightbox is, etc..
        url: this.href
    });
    return false;
});
</code></pre>

<p>The benefits of this are numerous. Your site is accessible to screen readers, web crawlers and users with javascript off, and even those with javascript turned on will get a meaningful URL in their status bar, so they'll know where they're going.</p>

createCookie(""myVar"", x);

var newX = readCookie(""myVar"") + 1;

alert(newX); // ""11""

// --- instead, do this: ---

var newX = parseInt(readCookie(""myVar""), 10) + 1;

"<p>In code we got from a ""psd2html""-service, I see a lot of spans surrounding the contents of div-tags.</p>

I do not know of a single datatype that would be able to acuratly and consistently store a large amount of prime numbers.

Thanks all for responding - Everyone is right - I should have just tested it out myself, but I had an exam the next morning and had this thought while studying that I wanted to check to see if it worked. People keep suggesting that its bad OOP - maybe but it does allow for some elegant code. Let me explain it a bit and see if you still think so. Here's what I came up with:</p>

<pre><code>//PHP User Model: 

class User {
    constructor() { ... }

    public static find($uid) {
         $db-&gt;connect(); // Connect to the database

         $sql = ""SELECT STATEMENT ...WHERE id=$uid LIMIT 1;"";
         $result = $db-&gt;query($sql); // Returns an associative array

         $user = new User();

         foreach ($result as $key=&gt;$value)
            $user-&gt;$$key = $value; //Creates a public variable of the key and sets it to value

         $db-&gt;disconnect();
    }
}

//PHP Controller:

function findUser($id) {

    $User = User::find($id);

    echo $User-&gt;name;
    echo $User-&gt;phone;
    //etc...

}
</code></pre>

<p>I could have just put it in an associative array but I can never correctly name that array something meaningful (ie. $user->data['name'] ... ugly.) Either way you have to know what is in the database so I do not really understand what the argument is that its confusing, especially since you can just var dump objects for debugging.</p>

"<p>I have a MySQL database that I'm porting to PostgreSQL (because of GIS features).</p>

<p>Many of the tables have hundreds of thousands of rows, so I need to keep performance in mind.</p>

<p>My problem is that PostgreSQL seems abysmally slow...</p>

<p>For example, if I do a simple SELECT * FROM [table] on a particular table in the MySQL database, let's say one that has 113,000 rows, the query takes around 2 seconds to return the data.

<p>I've played a bit more with the select statement. If I just do <em>""Select NodeLinkID from NodeLink""</em>, the query is much quicker - less than a second to get 88,000 rows.
If I do <em>""Select NodeLinkID, shapenative from NodeLink""</em>, the query takes a long time - around 8 seconds.
Does this shed any light on what I'm doing wrong?</p>

  nodelink(length);</p>
  
  <p>analyze nodelink</p>

<h2><strong>Question resolution:</strong></h2>

<p>Well folks, it seems that it was all a storm in a teacup...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""<em>How did you measure those timings - in your application or the respective command line interfaces?</em>""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To test this theory, I put together a simple console app that ran the same query on the MySQL db, and the PGSQL database. Here is the output:</p>

<pre><code>Running MySQL query: [SELECT * FROM l_model_ldata]
MySQL duration = [2.296875]
Running PGSQL query: [SELECT * FROM nodelink]
PGSQL duration = [2.875]

<p>So the results are comparable.
It seems that the pgadmin tool that comes with postgreSQL is quite slow.

"<p>OK, I am a little bit lost...</p>

<p>I am pretty new to PHP, and I am trying to use CakePHP for my web-site.<br>
My DB is composed of two tables: </p>

<ul>
<li>users with user_id, name columns </li>
<li>copies with copy_id, copy_name, user_id (as foreign key to users) columns.</li>
</ul>

<p>and I have the matching CakePHP elements:</p>

<ul>
<li>User and Copy as a model</li>
<li>UserController as controller</li>
<li>I don't use a view since I just send the json from the controller.</li>
</ul>

<p>I have added hasMany relation between the user model and the copy model see below.</p>

<pre><code>var $hasMany = array(
    'Copy' =&gt; array(
        'className' =&gt; 'Friendship',
        'foreignKey' =&gt; 'user_id'
    )
); 
</code></pre>

<p>Without the association every find() query on the users table works well, but after adding the hasMany to the model, the same find() queries on the users stop working (print_r doesn't show anything), and every find() query I am applying on the Copy model </p>

<pre><code>$copy = $this-&gt;User-&gt;Copy-&gt;find('all', array(
    'condition' =&gt; array('Copy.user_id' =&gt; '2')
));
</code></pre>

<p>ignores the condition part and just return the whole data base.  </p>

<p>How can I debug the code execution? When I add <code>debug($var)</code> nothing happens. </p>
","9021","","<p>I think the main problem is this:</p>

<pre><code>'condition' =&gt; array('Copy.user_id' =&gt; '2')
</code></pre>

<p>It should be ""conditions"".</p>

<p>Also, stick to the naming conventions. Thankfully Cake lets you override pretty much all its assumed names, but it's easier to just do what they expect by default.</p>

<ul>
<li>The primary keys should be all named <code>id</code></li>
<li>The controller should be pluralised: <code>UsersController</code></li>
</ul>

"<p>I'm using the Adjacency List Model to create categories, and it works perfectly.</p>

<p>When retrieving articles in a certain category (for example electronics), I would like to also retrieve the articles in the sub categories (for example electronics->cameras, or even electronics->cameras->camera lenses).</p>

<p>The way I am doing it now is pulling from the DB all the category id's of the sub categories of electronics, and finding all articles with a category_id in this list.</p>

<p>This seems to me very inefficient and time-consuming, since this could result in many queries to retrieve these sub categories.</p>

<p>Another way I thought of doing this is having every article associated with the whole category tree (for example an article about camera lenses will also be associated with the camera and electronics categories in MANY_MANY table), and when I retrieve all articles in electronics it will also appear.</p>

<p>This would add a lot of redundant data to the database though, as I might have to store 3 or 4 categories for each article. Also, it would complicate actions like moving an article to another category.</p>

<p>Is this the right way to go? Or is there a better/simpler way that I have not thought of?</p>

<p>I should add a <strong>really big caveat</strong> here. If you're leaving any tags in a strip_tags whitelist, you can still be susceptible to javascript injection. Assume you're allowing the seemingly innocuous tags <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;em&gt;</code>:</p>

like &lt;strong onmouseover=""window.href=http://mydodgysite.com""&gt;this&lt;/strong&gt;.

<p>You have a couple of serious options:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>strip_tags</code> with no whitelist. Safe, but doesn't allow for any formatting, and may cause problems with strings like this: <code>""x&lt;y, but y&gt;4"" --&gt; ""x4""</code></li>
<li><code>htmlentities</code>. Use this when displaying the data on the screen (not on the data before you put it in the database). It's safe, but doesn't allow for formatting.</li>
<li>A different markup system than HTML, for example: <a href=""http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/"" rel=""nofollow"">Markdown</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help%3AWiki_markup"" rel=""nofollow"">Wiki markup</a>, <a href=""http://www.bbcode.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">BB Code</a>.

<p>I need to loop through an array and create a number of elements which I want to have in a single jQuery result object.</p>

<pre><code>for (var i = 0; i &lt; 10; ++i) {
    $myJQueryObj = $myJQueryObj.add($(""&lt;span&gt;blahblah&lt;/span&gt;""));
}

<p>The problem with this, however, is that you need a jQuery object to begin with, and you obviously want to start it empty. In the above example, how should I initialise <code>$myJQueryObj</code> ?</p>

<p>The following examples do not work, as they all select the document object:</p>

<pre><code>$('')
$()
$(null)
$(false)

"<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>foreach ($veryFatArray as $key =&gt; $value) {
</code></pre>

<p>Will the foreach assign the value behind the $key by reference to $value, or will $value be a copy of what's stored in the array? And if yes, how could I get an reference only? The array values store pretty big amounts of data so copying them is not really good.</p>
","9021","","<p><code>$value</code> will be a copy, but (please someone correct me if I'm wrong here), PHP is actually very smart about pass-by-value type things. It will actually do a pass-by-reference and only copy if you modify the variable. For example:</p>

<pre><code>function foo ($bar) {
    echo $bar['x'];
    // internally, $bar is a reference to $baz. (virtually) no extra memory used
    $bar['y'] = 'Y';
    // only now has the array been copied in memory
}

$baz = array('x' =&gt; '1', 'y' =&gt; '2');
foo($baz);
</code></pre>

<p>In your <code>foreach</code>, if you want to modify the original array, you could do this:</p>

<pre><code>// PHP 4
foreach (array_keys($veryFatArray) as $key) {
    $value =&amp; $veryFatArray[$key];
    // ...
}

// PHP 5
foreach ($veryFatArray as $key =&gt; &amp;$value) { }

"<p>I use alert boxes to warn the user about errors when submitting a form on a website I am working on, but each time I click the ""ok"" button to close the alert box, the page go back to the top and I need to scroll down again to see the form.</p>

What is wrong?</p>
","9021","","<p>The page jumping to the top is usually a sign that you are linking to <code>'#'</code> but not cancelling the action - I've never seen that happen on a form submit myself.</p>

<p>Here's an example of something which might cause the page to jump:</p>

<pre><code>// HTML
&lt;a href=""#"" onclick=""return doSomething()""&gt;

// JS
function doSomething() {
    blah();
    x = 5 / 0;      // divide by zero error, therefore the next line
    return false;   // is not executed
}
</code></pre>

<p>After the page jumps, look in the address bar. Is there a # at the end?</p>

<p>Just make sure that <code>onclick</code> or <code>onsubmit</code> functions always return false if you don't want the default action to occur.</p>

"<p>I'm trying to make a live, in-page css editor with a preview function that would reload the stylesheet and apply it without needing to reload the page. What would be the best way to go about this?</p>
","9021","","<p>On the ""edit"" page, instead of including your CSS in the normal way (with a <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag), write it all to a <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag. Editing the <code>innerHTML</code> property of that will automatically update the page, even without a round-trip to the server.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;style type=""text/css"" id=""styles""&gt;
    p {
        color: #f0f;
    }
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;textarea id=""editor""&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;
&lt;button id=""preview""&gt;Preview&lt;/button&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The Javascript, using jQuery:</p>

<pre><code>jQuery(function($) {
    var $ed = $('#editor')
      , $style = $('#styles')
      , $button = $('#preview')
    ;
    $ed.val($style.html());
    $button.click(function() {
        $style.html($ed.val());
        return false;
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>And that should be it!</p>

<p>If you wanted to be really fancy, attach the function to the keydown on the textarea, though you could get some unwanted side-effects (the page would be changing constantly as you type)</p>

"<p>Hello I have a couple questions about PHP exec() and passthru().  </p>

I never used exec() in PHP but I have seen it is sometimes used with imagemagick.  I am now curious, what is some other common uses where exec is good in a web application?</p>

<p><strong>2)</strong><br>
About 6 years ago when I first started playing around with PHP I did not really know anything, just very basic stuff and I had a site that got compromised and someone setup there own PHP file that was using the passthru() function to pass a bunch of traffic throught my site to download free music or video and I got hit with a 4,000$ bandwidth charge from my host!  6 years later, I know soo much more about how to use PHP but I still don't know how this ever happened to me before.

<p>The comments below got me wondering about which is actually faster, so I wrote some benchmarking.</p>

<li><code>strpos</code> is really fast if you're not working with large strings.</li>
<li><code>strncmp</code> is reliable and fast.</li>
<li><code>preg_match</code> is never a good option.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here's the long version:</p>

<ul>
<li>Two different ""haystacks"":
<ol>
<li>10000 characters of <a href=""http://www.lipsum.com/"">lipsum</a></li>
<li>83 characters of lipsum.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>5 different searching methods:
<ol>
<li><a href=""http://php.net/strpos"">strpos</a>:<br>
<code>return strpos($haystack, $needle) === 0</code></li>
<li><a href=""http://php.net/preg_match"">preg_match</a><br>
<code>return preg_match(""/^$needle/"", $haystack) === 1</code></li>
<li><a href=""http://php.net/substr"">substr</a><br>
<code>return substr($haystack, 0, strlen($needle)) === $needle</code></li>
<li><a href=""http://php.net/strncmp"">strncmp</a><br>
<code>return strncmp($needle, $haystack, strlen($needle)) === 0</code></li>
<li>Manual looping:</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<pre><code>for ($i = 0, $l = strlen($needle); $i &lt; $l; ++$i) {
    if ($needle{$i} !== $haystack{$i}) return false;
}
return true;</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>7 different ""needles""
<ul>
<li>3 matching (lengths: 83, 5 and 1 character)</li>
<li>4 non-matching (lengths: 83, 82, 5 and 1 characters). The 82 char needle doesn't match at all, and the 83 character needles matches all but the last character.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>100,000 iterations, per method per needle per haystack</li>
</ul>

<p>Interesting points:</p>

<ul>
<li>The fastest individual test of all was <code>strpos</code> on the long, entirely non-matching needle against the short haystack.
<ul>
<li>In fact, out of the 14 tests run per method, <code>strpos</code> recorded the top 11 times.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The slowest individual test was the manual method on the long needles, regardless of haystack size. Those four tests were 10-20 times slower than almost all the other tests.</li>
<li>Though <code>strpos</code> had the best performance, it was weighed down by the long non-matching needles on the long haystack. They were 5-10 times slower than most tests.</li>
<li><code>strncmp</code> was fast <em>and</em> the most consistent.</li>
<li><code>preg_match</code> was consistently about 2 times slower than the other functions</li>
</ul>

","9021","","<p>As others have said, <code>tfoot</code> is defined before the <code>tbody</code> but rendered afterwards. This is by design and doesn't change the semantics (a table has a head, a foot and a body - the order of these doesn't matter)</p>

<p>The <em>reason</em> it's done this way is so that the foot can be loaded and displayed on screen while the body is still downloading, so you can still read the summary information you have in the foot.

"<p><strong>PLATFORM:</strong>
PHP &amp; mySQL</p>

<p>For my experimentation purposes, I have tried out few of the XSS injections myself on my own website. Consider this situation where I have my form textarea input. As this is a textarea, I am able to enter text and all sorts of (English) characters. Here are my observations:</p>

<p>A). If I apply only strip_tags and mysql_real_escape_string and do not use htmlentities on my input just before inserting the data into the database, <strong>the query is breaking</strong> and I am hit with an error that shows my table structure, due to the abnormal termination.</p>

<p>B). If I am applying strip_tags, mysql_real_escape_string and htmlentities on my input just before inserting the data into the database, <strong>the query is NOT breaking</strong> and I am able to  successfully able to insert data from the textarea into my database.</p>

<p>So I do understand that htmentities must be used at all costs but unsure when exactly it should be used. With the above in mind, I would like to know:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>When exactly htmlentities should be used? Should it be used just before inserting the data into DB or somehow get the data into DB and then apply htmlentities when I am trying to show the data from the DB?</p></li>
<li><p>If I follow the method described in point B) above (which I believe is the most obvious and efficient solution in my case), do I still need to apply htmlentities when I am trying to show the data from the DB? If so, why? If not, why not? I ask this because it's really confusing for me after I have gone through the post at: <a href=""http://shiflett.org/blog/2005/dec/google-xss-example"">http://shiflett.org/blog/2005/dec/google-xss-example</a></p></li>
<li><p>Then there is this one more PHP function called: <strong>html_entity_decode</strong>. Can I use that to show my data from DB (after following my procedure as indicated in point B) as htmlentities was applied on my input? Which one should I prefer from: html_entity_decode and htmlentities and when?</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>PREVIEW PAGE:</strong></p>

<p>I thought it might help to add some more specific details of a specific situation here. Consider that there is a 'Preview' page. Now when I submit the input from a textarea, the Preview page receives the input and shows it html and at the same time, a hidden input collects this input. When the submit button on the Preview button is hit, then the data from the hidden input is POST'ed to a new page and that page inserts the data contained in the hidden input, into the DB. If I do not apply htmlentities when the form is initially submitted (but apply only strip_tags and mysql_real_escape_string) and there's a malicious input in the textarea, the hidden input is broken and the last few characters of the hidden input visibly seen as  <code>"" /&gt;</code> on the page, which is undesirable. So keeping this in mind, I need to do something to preserve the integrity of the hidden input properly on the Preview page and yet collect the data in the hidden input so that it does not break it. How do I go about this? Apologize for the delay in posting this info.</p>

<p>Thank you in advance.</p>
","9021","","<p>Here's the general rule of thumb.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Escape variables at the <strong>last possible moment</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You want your variables to be clean representations of the data. That is, if you are trying to store the last name of someone named ""O'Brien"", then you definitely <em>don't</em> want these:</p>

<pre><code>O&amp;#39;Brien
O\'Brien
</code></pre>

<p>.. because, well, that's not his name: there's no ampersands or slashes in it. When you take that variable and output it in a particular context (eg: insert into an SQL query, or print to a HTML page), <em>that</em> is when you modify it.</p>

<pre><code>$name = ""O'Brien"";

$sql = ""SELECT * FROM people ""
     . ""WHERE lastname = '"" . mysql_real_escape_string($name) . ""'"";

$html = ""&lt;div&gt;Last Name: "" . htmlentities($name, ENT_QUOTES) . ""&lt;/div&gt;"";
</code></pre>

<p>You never want to have <code>htmlentities</code>-encoded strings stored in your database. What happens when you want to generate a CSV or PDF, or anything which <em>isn't</em> HTML?</p>

<p>Keep the data clean, and only escape for the specific context of the moment.</p>

"<p>I am working on a cache class, I would like to be able to set and get cached items from 5 different storage mediums.  Memcache, APC cache, file cache, sessions, cookies.  Maybe even a 6th (database could be added as a 6th).</p>

<p>My goal is to make this flexible enough that I can use it in the future on many projects very easily (portable).  I also would like to be able to set/get cache items all from calling 1 set method and 1 get method.  </p>

<p>Below is the code I have started so far which will allow me to do that.  In my switch block I am not sure if I should put all the code for that cache type there or have it call another method, or have each switch block item call a completley new class/object.  </p>

<p>I am thinking that if I put each cache system in it's own class file, then my autolaoding will not need to load as much code for this if only a couple of the cache types is used on a page.  I am not sure though, using autoloading for my class files, would it still load 6 different class files in the code below or would it ONLY load the files that the switch needs.  For example if a page only uses the sessions cache, would my switch below only load a session class file or would PHP automaticly load all the files?  It is hard to test because if I put something to try to test it in my code, then it will definately load all the files.</p>

    'Sydney'   : 42000,

}

<li><p>Put the above into a function which is called every second, using setInterval</p></li>

<p>A caveat though: it won't be guaranteed accurate, since in theory, a location's timezone could change while someone has the window open (they could be on the border of DST). It's not very likely, and a page refresh would show the right times, so it's probably not a big deal.</p>

"<p>So I've got all of this really neato PHP code and I've started doing some reuse with functions out of necessity.  I'm debugging, trying to figure out why I can't delete comments on my website while I'm deleting folder (because who wants orphaned comments?)</p>

<p>So I have a call to deletefolder( $parent) inside a file called deletefolder.php.  This a function that will recursively traverse my tree structure.  </p>

<p>I've include another file inside deletefolder.php.  The file is call helpers.php, and it contains the deletefolder function.</p>

<p>The deletefolder function calls deletecomments (kills all the comments per file) and delete file (which kills the file itself).</p>

<p>Now, all of it is just slathered with echo statements to help me figure out what's going on.  When I call this combination of functions from other locations I don't seem to have a problem getting messages.  But when I call them from the deletefolder.php page I don't get any.  Does anybody know why this would be the case?</p>
","9021","","<p>Well, I seriously doubt you've found a bug in the <code>echo</code> command, so the problem is with your program logic somewhere. Without seeing your code, it's impossible to say really. Perhaps there's some variable being set or unset unexpectedly, or you're not actually <code>include()</code>ing the files properly.</p>

"<p>I'm actually working on a PHP project that will feature a user system (Login,Register,Send lost password to email,..) and I think that this may be very vulnerable to Brute-Force attacks and/or Spam (Send a password to someone's email like 1000 times, etc. use your fantasy)

<li><p>What would be the best way to implement an Anti-Spam/Flood system, if I e.g.: want a page not be able to be called more than two times a minute, however another page may be called up to 100 times a minute or so.</p>

<li><p>I would definitely have to store IP adresses, the time when they last visited a page and the number of visits somewhere - but would it be efficient enough storing it in a text-file/database (MySQL)</p></li>
<li><p>Should I use captchas for things like registering/recovering lost passwords?</p></li>
<li><p>Are ""text"" captchas viable? (Something like ""What is 5 plus 9 minus 2? "")</p></li>
<li><p>The page won't be used by that many users (100-200), do I actually have to implement all these things?</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
","9021","","<p><strong>Regarding CAPTCHAs:</strong> I would recommend against using CAPTCHAs unless you really need it. Why?</p>

<ol>
<li>it's ugly.</li>
<li>it's annoying for your users. You shouldn't make them jump through hoops to use your site.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are some alternatives which are very simple, can be very effective and are entirely transparent to <em><sub>(almost all)</sub></em> users.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Honeypot fields</strong>: add a field to your forms with a common name like ""website"". Beside it, add a label saying something to the effect of ""don't write in this box"". Using Javascript hide the input and label. When you receive a form submission, if there's anything in the field, reject the input.</p>

<p>Users with JS won't see it and will be fine. Users without JS will just have to follow the simple instruction. Spambots will fall for it and reveal themselves.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Automatic faux-CAPTCHA</strong>: This is similar to the above. Add an input field with a label saying <a href=""http://www.alexanderdickson.com/blog/2009/11/the-success-of-my-anti-spam-measure/"">""Write 'Alex'""</a> (for example). Using Javascript (and knowing that most automated spam bots won't be running JS), hide the field and populate it with 'Alex'. If the submitted form doesn't have the magic word there, then ignore it.</p>

<p>Users with JS won't see it and will be fine. Users without JS will just have to follow the simple instruction. Spambots won't know what to do and you can ignore their input.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>This will safeguard you from 99.9% of automated spam bots. What it won't do, even in the slightest, is safeguard you against a targeted attack. Someone could customise their bot to avoid the honeypot or always fill in the correct value. </p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Regarding Brute Force blocking:</strong> A server-side solution is the only viable way to do this obviously. For one of my current projects, I implemented a brute force protection system very similar to what you describe. It was based on this <a href=""http://bakery.cakephp.org/articles/view/brute-force-protection"">Brute Force Protection plugin</a> for CakePHP.</p>

<p>The algorithm is fairly simple, but a little confusing initially.</p>

<ol>
<li>User requests some action (reset password, for example)</li>
<li>Run: <code>DELETE * FROM brute_force WHERE expires &lt; NOW()</code></li>
<li><p>Run:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT COUNT(*) FROM brute_force 
WHERE action = 'passwordReset'
AND ip = &lt;their ip address&gt;
</code></pre></li>
<li>If the count is greater than <code>X</code> then tell them to wait a while.</li>
<li><p>Otherwise, run:</p>

<pre><code>INSERT INTO brute_force (ip, action, expires)
VALUES (&lt;their ip address&gt;, 'passwordReset', NOW() + Y minutes)
</code></pre></li>
<li>Continue with the reset password function.</li>
</ol>

<p>This will allow users to only try resetting a password X times in Y minutes. Tweak these values as you see fit. Perhaps 3 resets in 5 minutes? Additionally, you could have different values for each action: for some things (eg: generate a PDF), you might want to restrict it to 10 in 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
","9021","","<p>When you assign <strong>class</strong> variables like that, they actually can't be variable. That is, they have to be a literal value, such as a string, or a constant like in your second example which worked.</p>

<p><em>Ok:</em></p>

<pre><code>public $foo = 123;
public $bar = ""hello"";
public $blah = SOME_CONSTANT;
</code></pre>

<p><em>Not Ok:</em></p>

<pre><code>public $foo = 123 + 45;
public $bar = ""hello""
            . ""world"";
public $blah = some_function();

<p>What you probably want is <strong>instance</strong> variables. These are initialised in the class constructor, which is a function which is run whenever you create a new instance of that class.</p>

<pre><code>class Foo {
    public $bar,
           $baths;

"<p>We are using file system to store files within the application. Now we change this to use SQL2K5 for storing as BLOB instead as per requirement.</p>

<p>Now, we need advice regarding the design for table. Obviously, it must have a folder, files within files, size, last date modified, etc., similar to file system.</p>

<p>I start with:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>FileID, ParentFileID, FileName, Size, LastDateModified, DateCreated, LastModifiedBy, ModifiedBy</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How can this be modified to handle folders as well?</p>
","9021","","<p>As Mitch Wheat said, there's a really good system for this already, and it's called the File System - my first recommendation would be to look at your requirements again to see if it is <em>actually</em> required.</p>

<p>However, you may have your reasons, so here's how i'd structure the table:</p>

<pre><code>filesystem (
    id,        // auto increment
    type,      // flag field: 1 = file, 2 = folder, 3 = symlink, if needed (?)
    parent_id, // id of a folder
    filename,
    modified,
    created,
    modified_by,
    created_by,
    file_data    // blob
)
</code></pre>

<p>You'd need a unique index on (parent_id, filename) if you wanted to emulate a real system. </p>

<p>If you needed per-file permissions, I'd just duplicate the Unix approach with owner/group/everyone permissions - you'd need to track owner and group_id in that table too. Perhaps you could simplify it to owner/everyone, and you probably could just use read/write (forgoing ""execute"").</p>

  alert(id);
  var checked = $(""input[@id="" + id + ""]:checked"").length;

","9021","","<p>IDs must be unique in your document, meaning that you <strong>shouldn't</strong> do this:</p>

    &lt;input type=""checkbox"" name=""chk[]"" value=""Bananas"" /&gt;

"<p>I have a modal window that presents a form to users. The form includes one or more file uploads as well. Therefore I cannot submit the form with ajax. </p>

<p>At the moment I'm doing a standard submit with a submit button. When the form is submitted (which takes a few seconds in general), a PDF is generated and sent back for download (i.e. the Content-Disposition: attachment header), to force the download. Once the upload of the form data has completed, I need to close the modal window. If I call the close method straight way the submission never completes and the file download is never triggered (I think this is because the modal window is removed from the DOM). I can set a timeout, but there could be n number of images, so the time it takes to upload is unpredictable (and relative to the number of uploads).</p>

","9021","","<p>The file extension "".sql"" is essentially meaningless: it's just there so that <em>you</em> know what the file is. It will just be a plain text file containing SQL, which you can open in Notepad. Therefore, there's no special ""mysql"" or ""sql server"" extensions.</p>

<p>The errors you're getting there <code>""Table 'ads' already exists""</code> are because you're trying to create a table which already exists in the database. (Did you read the error?) You have a few options:</p>

<p>No, but really though - this practice this a little outdated. Users expect to be able to see the URL of the link they're about to click to ensure it is legit. If you want to give people more information about a link, encode it either in the paragraph (eg: ""take a look at <a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">this big search engine</a> or <a href=""http://bing.com"" rel=""nofollow"">this up-and-coming one</a>""), or use the <code>title</code> attribute on the link.

"<p>I've got a set of form validation rules that I wrote with the jquery <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/Validator"" rel=""nofollow"">validator</a> plugin.  Since I have to repeat the same validation on the server side, I thought it would be nice not to have to rewrite my rules in PHP.  If the rules were simple <code>field=&gt;rulename=&gt;value</code> I could just store them as JSON and decode them into PHP arrays.  Unfortunately, some of the rules are dependent on other fields or have calculated values.</p>

","9021","","<p>I would recommend doing the opposite: convert some PHP-based validation functions to Javascript ones. The automatically converted functions aren't going to be as flexible, and hence as versatile or strong as the hand-coded functions, and you really want the best to be on the server-side. The worst case scenario if you stuff up some PHP->JS validation is that the user gets a round trip to the server before they're told that their email address is wrong.</p>

"<p>Can anyone recommend the best practice for storing general site preferences? For example, the default page title if the script doesn't set one, or the number of featured items to display in a content box, or a list of thumbnail sizes that the system should make when a picture is uploaded. Centralizing these values has the obvious benefit of allowing one to easily alter preferences that might be used on many pages.</p>

<p>My default approach was to place these preferences as attribute/value pairs in a &#42;gulp&#42; EAV table.</p>

"<p>Do you know any solution to recover from the PHP fatal error : ""<em>Allowed memory size ... exhausted</em>""</p>

<p>I have a shutdown function that is called when a fatal error appear. This function create an ErrorException from it, and logs it.</p>

<p>The problem is : when there is no more memory available, it can't log the error (I log in Firebug, via FirePHP, with Zend Framework).</p>

<p>So what i mean by ""<em>how to recover from it</em>"", is how to perform basic error log, and let Zend Framework send the Headers, so that the error is logged (in Firebug in my case) as any other error ?</p>

"<p>I'm working with a tree structure in MySQL that is respresented using the nested sets model.</p>

<p>I'm hoping some of you sql experts can help me with building a SELECT query.</p>

<p>I would like to be able to match a set of nodes using LIKE.  For each node that is matched, I also need a comma-delimmited list of the ancestors of that node, and a comma-delimmited list of the immediate children of that node.</p>

<p>I'm not really sure where to start with this - if such a thing is even possible in a single query. (Currently I am accomplishing this with a query inside a loop.)  What I'm hoping for is a result set that might look something like this....</p>

<p>Starting with the string ""qu"" and querying the Table ""Body"" I get...</p>

<pre><code>Node      | Parent Nodes               | Immediate Children
Quads       Leg, Lower Body, Muslces     Vastus Lateralus, Vastus Medialis, Rectus Femoris
Obliques    Core, Trunk, Muscles         Inner obliques, outer obliques
</code></pre>

<p>Any suggestions on how to accomplish this without looping queries would be much appreciated.</p>
","9021","","<p>In one query? I wouldn't bother. The SQL would be horrendous, and probably not even that efficient. Split each bit up into logical smaller queries: first find all the matching nodes, then for each of those, the extra info you need.</p>

"<p>I've got 2 jQuery functions. One calls the other (in theory...). These are:</p>

<pre><code>$.testFunction = function(arg1){

}

$.testFunction = function(arg1, arg2){
    alert(""testFunction(arg1, arg2)"");
    alert(""arg1: "" + arg1 + ""\narg2: "" + arg2);
}
</code></pre>

<p>I've got two functions, because when I haven't got the second parameter to pass, I'd like to call the simple version of them. 
But when I call like this:</p>

<pre><code>$.testFunction(""first param"");
alert(""Before second call"");
$.testFunction(""first param"", ""second param"");
</code></pre>

<p>It's always calling the second one, and (in the alert window) puts: ""testFunction(arg1, arg2)"" then ""arg1:  first param arg2:  <strong>undefined</strong>"". Why is working like this? Why is not the first function being called when I pass only one parameter? </p>
","9021","","<p>Uhh - you're overwriting the first function immediately. Here's the equivalent of what you're doing:</p>

<pre><code>x = ""foo"";
x = ""bar"";
alert(x);  // 'bar' -- ""why isn't this foo????!?!""

<p>A good option would be to write a single function which behaves differently depending on the number of arguments passed to it:</p>

<p>I'm not sure if it was just a transcription error or not, but in your example, you're using a single-quoted string. <code>\n</code> and <code>\t</code> are only treated as new-line and tab if you've got a double quoted string. That is:</p>

"<p>I'm trying to normalize a mysql database....</p>

<p>I currently have a table that contains 11 columns for ""categories"". The first column is a user_id and the other 10 are category_id_1 - category_id_10. Some rows may only contain a category_id up to category_id_1 and the rest might be NULL.</p>

<p>I then have a table that has 2 columns, user_id and category_id... </p>

<p>What is the best way to transfer all of the data into separate rows in table 2 without adding a row for columns that are NULL in table 1?</p>

"<p>Is these some simple JS code that allows me to check whether a cell is empty. </p>

<p>I am trying to code a function that is called using ""onmouseover=func()""; I just cant seem to get the JS code right. Any ideas?</p>

","9021","","<p>It depends a little on what will be in there initially. In my experience, tables behave strangely if a cell contains only whitespace, and so a common workaround is to put a <code>&amp;nbsp;</code> in there to stop it collapsing. Anyway, here's how you'd check:</p>

<pre><code>function elementIsEmpty(el) {
    return (/^(\s|&amp;nbsp;)*$/.test(el.innerHTML);
}

function replaceCell(td) {
    if (elementIsEmpty(td)) {
        td.innerHTML = 'Cell Empty';

","9021","","<p>Firstly it depends how you're going to mix them. That is, you could average the RGB components (this means blue (0,0,255) + yellow (255,255,0) == grey (128,128,128)), or you could work on Hues, Saturation and Value, which often gives a much more ""as expected"" result.</p>

<p>I know about eval(), but I dont think you can eval statements like the above.</p>
","9021","","<p>I think you can do this with the ""new Function"" operator. I've never used it myself, since I'm not clinically insane, but I believe you can pass it a string which it will <code>eval</code>uate and use as the function body. You can also get the code for each function by calling <code>myFunction.toString()</code>. So put together, it'd be something like this:</p>

<pre><code>var functionsToMessUp = ['myFunc1', 'myFunc2'];

for (var i = 0; i &lt; functionsToMessUp.length; ++i) {
    var theFunc = window[functionsToMessUp[i]]; // assuming they're in global scope
    window[functionsToMessUp[i]] = new Function(

        + theFunc.toString()

<p>Putting a style inline is nothing to do with the fact that it's an inline element. I've had similar problems in the past when using a homebrew toggle-visibility script and classes. The way that many naive implementations (such as mine) worked is like this:</p>

    el.style.display = (el.style.display == 'none') ? '' : 'none';
}

<p>If it's not hidden, change the inline style to hidden. If it is hidden, <em>remove the inline style</em>. When you remove the inline style, it then reverts to style defined in your stylesheet, which is why it doesn't get shown.</p>

<p>Like I said, I tried replicating your error using jQuery's <code>show()</code> function and couldn't do it. In my tests, jQuery is smart enough to revert to what the display style was before, so I don't know exactly what the problem is, but it sounds a lot like the problem I had before.</p>

&lt;span class=""motd""&gt;Today's the day!&lt;/span&gt;

"<p>I have an HTML form:</p>

  &lt;input type='checkbox' name='check_box_1' /&gt; Check me!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Here is a section from the PHP script <code>process.php</code>:</p>

<pre><code>echo (isset($_POST['check_box_1']))?'Set':'Not set';
</code></pre>

<p>The output of the script when the checkbox is set is</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Set</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But when the checkbox is not set, the output is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Not set</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why is this? This seems like a very poor design because my PHP script checks a number of <code>$_POST</code> variables to make sure they were passed along to the script. When the <code>$_POST['check_box_1']</code> value is not set, then how do I know whether the script failed to pass along the value or the checkbox was just not set?</p>
","9021","","<p>If you want to overcome this design feature, try this:</p>

<p>This way, you'll always have <code>$_POST['check_box_1']</code> set in the callback page, and then you can just check its value to see whether they checked it or not. The two inputs have to be in that order though, since the later one will take precedence.</p>

","9021","","<p>You could downsample the MP3 to a lower bitrate or go to mono instead of stereo. I doubt you'd have any luck with gzipping since MP3 is already a compressed file type. It's like zipping a zip - you might save a couple of kB, but it wouldn't be worth it.</p>

"<p>I have an anchor tag <code>&lt;a class=""next""&gt;next&lt;/a&gt;</code> made into a ""button"". Sometimes, this tag needs to be hidden if there is nothing new to show.  All works fine if I simply hide the button with .hide() and re-display it with .show().  But I wanted to uses .fadeIn() and .fadeOut() instead.</p>

<p>The problem I'm having is that if the user clicks on the button during the fadeOut animation, it can cause problems with the logic I have running the show.  The solution I found was to unbind the click event from the button after the original click function begins, and then re-bind it after the animation is complete.  </p>

<p><a href=""http://blog.codecrate.com/2009/10/twitter-style-alerts-in-rails.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.codecrate.com/2009/10/twitter-style-alerts-in-rails.html</a></p>

<pre><code>$(function () {
  var alert = $('.alert');
  if (alert.length &gt; 0) {
    alert.show().animate({height: alert.outerHeight()}, 200);

    window.setTimeout(function() {
      alert.slideUp();
    }, 3000);
  }
});
</code></pre>

<p>However, one thing that the code doesn't include is functions to stick the alert div to the top of the window, no matter how far down the page the user has scrolled.</p>

<p>I have found a few examples but nothing seems to play nice with this existing code.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>
","9021","","<p>You can use the CSS style : <code>position: fixed</code> though I think IE has some issues with that (no surprise there..).</p>

"<p>I noticed that if you wrap a radio button or checkbox in a label, the whole thing becomes clickable, even without a for/id pair (in fact, it seems to ignore this because I screwed it up!)</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;label&gt;&lt;input type=""checkbox""&gt; some text&lt;/label&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then ""some text"" becomes clickable to check the box. I tested it in FF, Chrome and Opera, and IE8, does anyone know if it works in older browsers, like IE6?</p>
","9021","","<p>Yes, that's the intended behaviour.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/interact/forms.html#h-17.9"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/interact/forms.html#h-17.9</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To associate a label with another control implicitly, the control element must be within the contents of the LABEL element. In this case, the LABEL may only contain one control element. The label itself may be positioned before or after the associated control.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It looks like this doesn't actually work in IE6 (haven't tried other versions). If you already have something like jQuery loading on your page, then you could come up with a workable solution fairly easily:</p>

<pre><code>if ($.browser.msie) {
    $('label:has(:input):not([for])').each(function() {
        var $t = $(this)
            , $in = $t.find(':input')
        ;
        if (!$in.attr('id')) {
            // use this, or make a proper GUID...
            $in.attr('id', 'input_' + (Math.random() * 1000000));
        }
        $t.attr('for', $in.attr('id'));
    });
}

"<p>I'd like to be able to identify whether a given DOM node has been appended/inserted into another node yet, or whether it is fresh out of document.createElement() or similar and has not been placed anywhere.</p>

<p>In most browsers just checking the parentNode works.</p>

<pre><code>if (!node.parentNode) {
  // this node is not part of a larger document
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, in Internet Explorer it appears that new elements, even right after they've been created with document.createElement() already have a parentNode object (of type DispHTMLDocument??).</p>

<p>Any other nice cross-browser and reliable way?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: looks like Internet Explorer is implicitly creating a DocumentFragment (with nodeType of 11) and setting that as the node's parentNode property.</p>
","9021","","<p>I think that even without IE's foibles, checking for the presence of parentNode might not be enough. For example:</p>

<pre><code>var d = document.createElement('div');
var s = document.createElement('span');
d.appendChild(s);
if (s.parentNode) {
    // this will run though it's not in the document
}
</code></pre>

<p>If something is in the document, then eventually one of its ancestors will be the document itself. Try this out and see how it goes:</p>

<pre><code>function inDocument(node) {
    var curr = node;
    while (curr != null) {
        curr = curr.parentNode;
        if (curr == document) return true;
    }
    return false;
}

// usage: 
// if (inDocument(myNode)) { .. }
</code></pre>

<p>If you only want to check to a certain depth - that is, you know that your newly created elements aren't going to be nested any further than IE's Fragment, try this:</p>

<pre><code>function inDocument(node, depth) {
    depth = depth || 1000;
    var curr = node;
    while ((curr != document) &amp;&amp; --depth) {
        curr = curr.parentNode;
        if (curr == null) return false;
    }
    return true;
}

inDocument(myNode, 2);  // check only up to two deep.
inDocument(myNode);     // check up to 1000 deep.

<p>Thank You.</p>
","9021","","<p>All modern browsers come with built-in spell checkers these days, and users can customise them to their own language, locale and even add new words. Don't bother trying to implement your own. If your IE6 users complain, tell them to upgrade.</p>

"<p>Yo.</p>

<p>I'm really quite new to this whole JavaScript business, not to mention AJAX, so I was thinking if you guys could help me out with a conundrum.</p>

<p>Basically, what I want is for the user to be notified upon a change in a value of a MySQL table. How should I go about that? Should I use jQuery, or can I slap something together myself?</p>

<p>Thankful for any and all replies.</p>
","9021","","<p>Depending on how quickly you need the users to be notified, you could use either polling (sending a request every X seconds to see if there's anything new) or use <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_%28programming%29"" rel=""nofollow"">comet</a>.</p>

<p>In any case, you'll need a server side programming language to be querying the database and serving the results, and you'll need some javascript on the client-side to be sending requests and displaying responses. I would highly recommend using the jQuery library, since it simplifies a lot of cross-browser incompatibility.</p>
"
"<p>Say I have the following:</p>

<pre><code>$query = ""
    SELECT user_id,email,password, roles.role_id,role_name
    FROM users
    JOIN roles USING(role_id)
    LIMIT 1
    "";
$result = mysql_query($query);
$user = mysql_fetch_assoc($result);
</code></pre>

<p>Then if I print_r($user) I get:</p>

<pre><code>Array(
    [user_id] =&gt; 1 
    [email] =&gt; example@example.com
    [password] =&gt; 5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99
    [role_id] =&gt; 1 
    [role_name] =&gt; admin 
    )
</code></pre>

<p>I would like to clean this array up a bit by using aliases for my column names in the select query. I can replace <code>user_id</code> with <code>id</code> easily enough but I would also like to choose aliases for <code>role_id</code> and <code>role_name</code> such that they are returned as <code>role =&gt; array (id =&gt; 1, name =&gt; admin)</code>.</p>

<p>For example, I have tried the following (which doesn't work):</p>

<pre><code>$query = ""
    SELECT user_id AS id,email,password, roles.role_id AS role[id],role_name AS role[name]
    FROM users
    JOIN roles USING(role_id)
    LIMIT 1
    "";
</code></pre>

<p>The array I would like this to return would look like:</p>

<pre><code>Array(
    [id] =&gt; 1 
    [email] =&gt; example@example.com
    [password] =&gt; 5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99
    [role] =&gt; Array(
        [id] =&gt; 1
        [name] =&gt; admin
        )
    )
</code></pre>
","9021","","<p>The standard <code>mysql_fetch_assoc</code> method won't do this for you: you'll have to do some post-production yourself.</p>

<pre><code>function my_assoc($result) {
    $row = mysql_fetch_assoc($result);
    if (is_array($row)) {
        $out = array();
        foreach ($row as $field =&gt; $value) {
            if (preg_match('/^([^\]]+)\[([^\]]+)\]$/', $field, $matches) {
                $out[$matches[1]][$matches[2]] = $value;
            } else {
                $out[$field] = $value;

        }
        return $out;
    } else {
        return $row;

"<p>I'm trying to create css buttons by using the following html markup:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href=""access.php"" class=""css_button_red""&gt;Forgot password&lt;/a&gt;

<p>But it ends up being not bigger than the text in the middle. Even though I've set the class's height and width. </p>

<p>You can preview the problem here btw, www.matkalenderen.no
Notice the first button, that's a form button and it's using it's own class. At first I tried to use the same class on the css button as well and the same problem appeared, so I tried to separate them into their own classes. In case there was some kind of crash. But it didn't matter anyway. </p>

<p>What am I missing here?</p>
","9021","","<p>As the others have said, by default <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> is an inline element, and inline elements can't specify a width or height. You can change it to be a block element like this:</p>

<pre><code>a {
    display: block;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Though it will then display (unsurprisingly) as a block, sitting on its own, outside the flow of the surrounding text. A better solution is to use <code>display: inline-block</code> which might be a best-of-both-worlds solution depending on your situation.</p>

<p>See <a href=""http://www.quirksmode.org/css/display.html#inlineblock"">PPK's writeup</a> about it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The real use of this value is when you want to give an inline element a width. In some circumstances some browsers don't allow a width on a real inline element, but if you switch to display: inline-block you are allowed to set a width.</p>

","9021","","<p>It's going to be a CSS issue. CSS can change the numbering/bullet style, and even turn it off altogether. Using Firebug, inspect the element and look at the CSS styles on the right to see what styles are being applied to it. Look for one called <code>list-style</code>.</p>

<pre><code>  $(document).ready(function() {
                $('#display').click(function(){
                    alert($('#a').val());
                });

","9021","","<p>You have to find all the selected options:</p>

<pre><code>jQuery(function($) {

        });                          // options have no value..?
    });
});

<hr>

<p>The manual, as Pim pointed out, is useful:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The .val() method is primarily used to get the values of form elements. In the case of <code>&lt;select multiple=""multiple""&gt;</code> elements, the <code>.val()</code> method returns an array containing each selected option.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, the above should work, but jQuery already does this behind the scenes for you, so this is much easier:</p>

<pre><code>alert($('#a').val().join("", ""));
</code></pre>

<p>If it's not working for you, it might be because of the fact that your options don't seem to have a value.</p>

When it reaches the bottom, the Gowalla page just stops - it actually loads up enough panels for about 4 minutes of sliding - though in your case, you might want to take panels off the bottom and push them back in the top to make it continuous.</p>

"<p>I designed my code to put all important functions in a single PHP file that's now 1800 lines long.</p>

<p>I call it in other PHP files--AJAX processors, for example--with a simple ""require_once(""codeBank.php"")"".</p>

<p>I'm discovering that it takes about 10 seconds to load up all those functions, even though I have nothing more than a few global arrays and a bunch of other functions involved.

<p>When I comment out the require_once, my AJAX response time speeds up from 10sec to 40ms, so it's pretty clear that PHP's trying to do something with those 1800 lines of functions.  That's even with APC installed, which is surprising.</p>

<p>What should I do to get my code speed back to the sub-100ms level?  Am I failing to get the cache's benefit somehow?  Do I need to cut that single function bank file into different pieces?  Are there other subtle things that I could be doing to screw up my response time?  </p>

<p>==========================</p>

<p>[EDIT]  Resolved.</p>

<p>==========================</p>

<p>As many of you kind people have noted, there's no logical reason why just having a 1800 line php function library should cause slowdowns.  What was actually happening is that I had a debug line that was invoking one of the longer, API-calling functions.  Whenever I was including the PHP file, I was constructing a whole data structure from remote, queried data.</p>

<p>Once I killed that line, everything went back to snappy 30ms responses.  What remains odd to me is that require_once() opens the php file every time the AJAX script was getting called.  But that's me being out of shape and forgetting that every time the AJAX script is finished it closes and is getting reopened and recompiled each time.</p>
","9021","","<p>It is very surprising that an include (even of 1800 lines) could slow it down that much. Firstly, perhaps you should look over the code to make sure it's not performing unnecessary processing. Actually parsing the file shouldn't be such a bottleneck.</p>

<p>That said, includes are one of the key bottlenecks in a lot of PHP programs. You could consider refactoring your code either into a number of smaller files (of which you would only include what you need), or (probably much easier), use PHP's <code>__autoload</code> function. It is a function which is automatically called whenever you refer to a class which doesn't exist, therefore you'd need to put your functions into a static class. eg:</p>

<pre><code>// include/ajaxlib.php
class AjaxLib {
    public static function renderResponse($data) {
        // whatever
    }
}

// a common include file:
function __autoload($class) {
    require 'include/' . strtolower($class) . '.php';
}

// your code:
AjaxLib::renderResponse($foo);

"<p>I know that Javascript is an incredibly unsecure way of programming a persistent game, where for instance you are doing battle calculations in an RPG and then award XP through linking to a PHP page when they win that adds XP to a database (since the player could make their own javascript to always win or just look at the PHP page that you get sent to when you win and just go there anyway).  </p>

"<p>I'm trying to stray away from using tables to form the layout of my content, and I can think of two alternatives that I'd like to better learn: (1) styling list items to be side-by-side, and (2) using div blocks that float onto the same line. Both of these would have their own uses for what I'm working on.</p>

<p>I'm already using div tags to form the entire layout of my three-column template, but what I need to do now is a bit different. In case it helps, my project can be found <a href=""http://www.joemajewski.com/fortress/"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.</p>

<p>In short, here's my question; how would I style a div so that the width of it is 50% of the width of the area it occupies, rather than 50% of the width of the page?</p>

<p>As for my other question, what would be the best approach to styling list items so that they are side-by-side? I'm working on a registration script now, and instead of using a table with ""Username"" on the left and the input text on the right, I can use two list items.</p>

<p>Thanks, friends. :)</p>
","9021","","<p>When you use percentage units for widths and heights, it is relative to the first ancestor element which has defined a width or height. Therefore, all you need to do is set up a div which is as wide as two columns:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""columnContainer""&gt;
    &lt;div class=""column""&gt;
        Column 1
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=""column""&gt;
        Column 2
    &lt;/div&gt;

.columnContainer {
    width: 800px;
}
.column {
    float: left;
    width: 50%;
}

<p>The server sends all available records to the client, and using Javascript, these results are split into pages and rendered client-side. Changing pages or item ordering is as good as instant, and requires no server interaction. This makes it much easier to cache the results on the server side.</p>

<p>Useful when:</p>

<ul>
<li>There's not many results (only a handful of pages)</li>
<li>Users will be using many pages (therefore sending the extra data isn't a waste)</li>
<li>Splitting up a form: because each page of inputs is merely being hidden and not removed, the entire form can be sent in one form submit.</li>
</ul>

<p>Not so great because:</p>

<ul>
<li>The initial page load is much larger</li>
<li>Might cause problems for users without JS on (though graceful degradation is quite possible)</li>
<li>You may need to duplicate your display logic into Javascript.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>A Blended approach</strong></p>

<p>Write your application to fully use server-side pagination. Once that is working, use javascript to intercept all links which change the page or the ordering, and send those requests via AJAX. Adapt your server-side script to return just the HTML necessary for any given page, and none of the page chrome around it when it is responding to an AJAX request.</p>

<p>Benefits: </p>

<ul>
<li>Minimal payload for each page-turn = faster response times.</li>
<li>Completely scalable.</li>
<li>Degrades perfectly.</li>
</ul>

"<p>We are writing a SaaS like solution that requires our customers to <code>SCRIPT SRC</code> some javascript code we are building (think Google Analytics scenario). We would like to use JQuery. However, since our customers might already have conflicting JQuery versions or other conflicting frameworks (prototype.js for one) we cannot tell them to source jquery.js.</p>

<p>We were thinking of coping the jquery source as to create a 'private' jquery instance and simple search/replace the <code>JQuery</code> and <code>$</code> functions with <code>myJQuery</code> and <code>$J</code></p>

<p>Is there any reason for this not to work? has anyone tried something like this? What can we do about plugins?</p>

ourJQ = jQuery.noConflict(true);

alert(""jQuery version: "" + jQuery().jquery); // 1.3.2 -- or whatever was included before
</code></pre>

<p>If you are including plugins or anything, just wrap it all in an anonymous function to create a closure:</p>

<pre><code>(function ($) {
    // in here, $ is your jQuery version

var spn=document.createElement(""span"");

"<p>I've heard many times that I should avoid flash for my website. Yet no one has told me a good reason for this.

"<p>I am writing a badword filter in PHP.</p>

<p>I have a list of badwords in an array and the method cleanse_text() is written like this:</p>

<pre><code>public static function cleanse_text($originalstring){
   if (!self::$is_sorted) self::doSort();
   return str_ireplace(self::$badwords, '****', $originalstring);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This works trivially, for exact matches, but I wanted to also censor words that have been disguised like 'ab*d' where 'abcd' is a bad word. This is proving to be a bit more difficult.</p>

<p>Here are my questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is a badword filter worth bothering with (it is a site for professionals so a certain minimum decorum is required - I would have thought)</p></li>
<li><p>Is it worth the hustle of trying to capture obvious work arounds like 'f*ck' - or should I not attempt to filter those out.</p></li>
<li><p>Is there a better way of writing the cleanse_text() method above?</p></li>
</ol>
","9021","","<p>I definitely wouldn't bother with it.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It's a site for professionals, so you can assume that they will act appropriately. Some moderation and enforcement of rules will put anyone in line. Look at Stack Overflow for example. Even without the community moderation tools, people can be pressured into behaving appropriately.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>It would fail.</strong> There would be too many false positives (""clbuttic""), and making a list which contained all possible swear words would be impossible to maintain. Replacing certain letters (eg: <code>f*ck</code>) makes it no less offensive. Removing the word altogether destroys meaning, which is a huge problem with false positives.</p></li>

<p>And how many other elements in XHTML which will not take font styling from <code>body {....}</code>?</p>
","9021","","<p>All browsers have built-in default stylesheets. That's why, when you make a page without any styles defined at all, <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tags are large and bold, and <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> makes text bold. Similarly, the font styles for <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code> elements are defined in the default styles.</p>

<p>To see this stylesheet in Firefox, put this into your address bar: <code>resource://gre/res/forms.css</code></p>

<p>Anyway, you have to override these styles as you would any other styles like you did in that last example.</p>

<p>In case you're wondering what other styles are defined, check out the CSS files in your resources. You can access them via the url above, or by looking in your <code>res</code> folder in the firefox directory (eg: <code>c:\program files\mozilla firefox\res</code>). These are the ones which may be affecting the styles of normal pages:</p>

<li>html.css</li>
<li>forms.css</li>
<li>quirk.css</li>
<li>ua.css</li>

<p>I've used the <code>+</code> modifier here so that it will match all adjacent numbers in one go, and hence require less replacing. The <code>g</code> at the end is a flag which means ""global"" and it means that it will replace ALL matches it finds, not just the first one.</p>

"<p>I'm building a library to access the Google Analytics Data Export API. All the data the library accesses is in Atom format and utilises numerous different namespaces throughout. My experiments with the API have used SimpleXML for parsing so far, especially as all I have been doing is accessing the data held within the feed.</p>

<p>Now I'm coming to write a library I am wondering whether forging ahead with SimpleXML will be adequate or whether the enhanced functionality of the DOM module in PHP would be of benefit in the future. I haven't written much code for this part of the library yet so the choice is still open.</p>

<p>I have read that the PHP DOM module can be a better choice if you need to build an XML DOM on the fly or modify an existing one, but I'm not entirely sure I would need that functionality anyway due to the nature of the API (no pushing data to the server, for instance). SimpleXML is certainly easier to use and I have seen people saying that for read-only situations it is all you need.</p>

<p>Essentially the question is, what would you use? Compatibility will not be an issue as the server configuration will match the application's requirements. Is it worth building the library with PHP DOM in mind or should I stick with SimpleXML for now?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Here are two examples of the kind of feeds I will be dealing with:</p>

","9021","","<p>My take on it:</p>

<p><strong>SimpleXML pros:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Simple</li>
<li>Semi-intuitive non-verbose code</li>
<li>Great for reading/parsing documents</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>SimpleXML cons:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Terrible for generating XML.</li>
<li>Lacking in flexibility and power</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>DOM pros:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Tremendously powerful</li>
<li>Great for generating documents</li>
<li>Will be familiar if you've done any other DOM scripting (eg: in Javascript)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>DOM cons:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Verbose</li>
<li>Sometimes needlessly complicated.</li>
</ul>

<p>I personally would stick to DOM all the way. It will get you anywhere you need to go. The documentation is more than adequate, and although your hands might get sore from all the typing, you'll never get frustrated thinking ""why can't it just do <em>this</em>??""</p>

<p>If all you need to do is read a document, or do some very basic editing, then probably go with SimpleXML. For me however, I'm used to the DOM libraries, so I just use that everywhere and it's great.</p>

<p>I first thought this is just for local scoping, i.e. creating local variables for the code block without polluting global namespace. But I've seen instances without any local variables at all too. </p>

<p>What am I missing here?</p>
","9021","","<p>As everyone else has said, it's pretty much entirely to do with creating local scope. Another benefit is that you can use it to (for want of a better word) ""rename"" variables. Take for instance, how several javascript frameworks use <code>$</code> as a shorthand for their main library function. If you create a closure like in your example, it doesn't matter what <code>$</code> is <em>outside</em>, you can use it as a parameter and inside it can be whatever you want:</p>

<pre><code>// out here $ might be Prototype, something else, or even undefined
(function($) {
    // in here, $ is jQuery
})(jQuery);
</code></pre>

<p>Another little tip for eking an extra couple of milliseconds of your script is to use this same technique to create an undefined variable. Most people think that <code>undefined</code> is a special keyword in javascript, but it's actually just treated as a normal variable, which you'd hope no one would define. The somewhat standard practice of checking for a undefined variable:</p>

<pre><code>if (x == undefined)
</code></pre>

<p>...is actually rather wasteful, since it checks the entire scope chain for a variable named ""undefined"". To shortcut this, you can use this method:</p>

<pre><code>(function($, undefined) {
    // code here
})(jQuery);  // note that there's just one parameter passed
</code></pre>

<p>Now that <code>undefined</code> is actually in a scope (with an undefined value), checking up the scope chain can stop at that point. Micro-optimisation, yes, but it doesn't hurt to know.</p>

    $j('#'+id).filter('#submit').attr('value', 'Edit');

    $j(""#addNewTruck"")[0].reset();

    createPickers();
}
</code></pre>

<p>the element is properly cloned and inserted into the div, but i cant find a way to access this element... the third line in the script never works.</p>

<p>Another problem i am having is that the 'values' in the cloned form revert back to the value in the source of the html rather than what the user inputs. </p>

","9021","","<p>I think you want to use <code>find</code> not <code>filter</code></p>

"<p>I am trying to develop a PHP class which would enable me to get the query string appended into a url and process it according to the variables passed. How can this be done?</p>

<p>Eg</p>

<pre><code>www.example.com?var1=a&amp;var2=b&amp;var3=c
</code></pre>

<p>now I want to get <code>?var1=a&amp;var2=b&amp;var3=c</code> section and process it based on the variables.</p>

<p>Thanks for your responses</p>

<p>but I want a means by which I can get the whole query string since I wont be sure of the variable names that will be sent into the URL thus the $_GET method wont work properly.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
","9021","","<p>If you want access to the URL parameters as a string you can use this:</p>

<pre><code>$_SERVER['QUERY_STRING']
</code></pre>

<p>But, I'm not sure how that would be any more useful than <code>$_GET</code>. You said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I wont be sure of the variable names </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can iterate through the <code>$_GET</code> array with a <code>foreach</code> loop:</p>

<pre><code>foreach ($_GET as $key =&gt; $val) {
    echo $key . "": "" . $val;
}
</code></pre>

<p>However... if you're talking about an <em>arbitrary</em> URL (not necessarily the one which was requested), then the above methods won't work since they obviously won't be in <code>$_GET</code>. Instead you can use <a href=""http://php.net/manual/en/function.parse-url.php"" rel=""nofollow""><code>parse_url</code></a></p>

<pre><code>$url = 'http://username:password@hostname/path?arg=value#anchor';

print_r(parse_url($url));

echo parse_url($url, PHP_URL_QUERY);
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code>Array
(
    [scheme] =&gt; http
    [host] =&gt; hostname
    [user] =&gt; username
    [pass] =&gt; password
    [path] =&gt; /path

"<p>Does it make a difference if you do <code>count(*)</code> vs <code>count(column-name)</code> as in these two examples?</p>

","9021","","<p>It's because of <a href=""http://www.htmldog.com/guides/cssadvanced/specificity/"" rel=""nofollow"">CSS Specificity</a>. The 'red' rule is more specific (elements which have this attribute AND this class) than the 'black' rule (elements which have this class).

            var $module = $(element).parents('.YourContainerClass');
            return $module.find('input:checked').length;
            });

            jQuery.validator.addClassRules(""ClassAppliedToCheckBoxes"", {
                    'ClassAppliedToCheckBoxes' : true
            });

            jQuery.validator.messages.required_group = 'Please check at least one of these fields.';

","9021","","<p>Try something like this:</p>

    var n = this.name;
    return $("":checkbox[name='"" + n ""']:checked"").length == 0;
});
</code></pre>

<p>From there, you could do a number of things. To halt form submission, check if the length is greater than zero (if so, there are some invalid ones). To highlight invalid ones:</p>

<pre><code>$invalid.parent().css({ color: '#f00' });
</code></pre>

<p>Note that this isn't a very efficient algorithm: it performs the check on the same group as many times as there are checkboxes. If this is a bottleneck then there's a place you can improve, but it'll be a good starting point anyway.</p>

","9021","","<p>Firstly, Marcel Korpel is right: using a server-side technology to include this snippet is the smarter way to go. If that isn't an option for you for whatever reason, you can do this:</p>

<p>To insert it using Javascript, you'd firstly need some way to identify where to put it. You could do this by having a div with a certain ID, or always put it in the same place (e.g.: at the end of the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>).</p>

<pre><code>var filename = '../pdf/sign-va.pdf',
    w = 720,
    h = 540
;
var obj = document.createElement('object');
    obj.setAttribute('width', w);
    obj.setAttribute('height', h);
    var param = document.createElement('param');
        param.setAttribute('name', 'Src');
        param.setAttribute('value', filename);
    obj.appendChild(param);
    var embed = document.createElement('embed');
        embed.setAttribute('width', w);

// at the end of the body
document.body.appendChild(obj);

// OR, into a particular div
document.getElementById('some_id').appendChild(obj);

"<p>Hey, everyone. I couldn't find anything Googling this problem, and I've found really good answers to some questions on SO before, so I'm taking this excuse to join the community.</p>

<p>I'm creating a hierarchy of classes for a PHP project I'm working on, and I'd like to have some variables in the classes initialized within the constructor function without explicitly writing the initialization code. Specifically I want to have the interpreter assume that some of the variables are actually pointers to a certain class. If I could do something like C structs, that would be pretty close to what I want.</p>

<p>So far, the only thing I came up with is to explicitly state the variable type within its own name and have the class call an initializing function on each, like;</p>

<pre><code>class A{
  ...
}

class B{
  var $x_A;

  function initVar($var){
    list($varname, $vartype) = split('_',$var);
    $this-&gt;$var = new $vartype();
  }

}
</code></pre>

<p>And B's constructor calls <code>initVar</code> on all of its <code>get_class_vars(get_class($this))</code>, so anything that inherits from it will do initialization in the same way; obviously including a check on the variable name, a check that the class exists, and a better separation scheme than a single underscore. I just cannot help but think that there is a better way to do this that isn't hardcoding the initialization into the construction function.</p>

<p>If anyone knows of a better way to do this, your help would be much appreciated.</p>
","9021","","<p>Your method there would probably work, however it could get very tiresome to actually use it. For example, imagine having to reference those variables all the time:</p>

<pre><code>$myObject-&gt;account_ServiceAccountType
</code></pre>

<p>If you really wanted to go with something like this, perhaps a mapping variable might be useful:</p>

<pre><code>class B {
    public $x, $account;

    private $map = array(
        'x' =&gt; 'A',
        'account' =&gt; 'ServiceAccountType'
    );

    public function __construct() {
        foreach ($this-&gt;map as $var =&gt; $class) {
            $this-&gt;$var = new $class;
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>You could also try this method out. It uses PHP's magic <code>__get</code> function.</p>

<pre><code>class B {
    private $map = array(
        'x' =&gt; 'A',
        'account' =&gt; 'ServiceAccountType'
    );
    private $vars;
    public function __construct() {
        $this-&gt;vars = array();
        foreach ($this-&gt;map as $var =&gt; $class) {
            $this-&gt;vars[$var] = new $class;
        }
    }

    public function __get($v) {
        return $this-&gt;vars[$v];

","9021","","<p>I don't really understand what you're asking for here, but I'll give it a shot. Firstly, remember that jQuery is just a series of functions written in Javascript. The <code>this</code> keyword is literally the same in ""both"" contexts.</p>

<p>Perhaps you want to get the actual DOM element instead of the jQuery object? You can use <code>.get()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>// let's say there's a single paragraph element
var obj = $('p');   // obj is a jQuery object 
var dom = obj.get(0);  // dom is a DOM element

"<p>I have a PHP form which enters data into my MySQL database. My primary key is one of the user-entered values. When the user enters a value that already exists in the table, the MySQL error ""Duplicate entry 'entered value' for key 1"" is returned.
Instead of that error, I would like to alert the user that they need to enter a different value. Just an echoed message or something.
I guess my question comes down to:
how to turn a specific MySQL error into a PHP message
Thanks</p>

<p>edit: nickf's answer below is nice, but is there any way to discern between specific errors?</p>
","9021","","<p>You can check the return value from <code>mysql_query</code> when you do the insert.</p>

","9021","","<p>Since jQuery 1.6, you can use <a href=""http://api.jquery.com/is/""><code>.is</code></a>. Below is the answer from over a year ago...</p>

<pre><code>var a = $('#foo');
var b = a;


if (a.is(b)) {
    // the same object!
}

<hr>

<p>If you want to see if two variables are actually the same object, eg:</p>

<pre><code>var a = $('#foo');
var b = a;
</code></pre>

<p>...then you can check their unique IDs. Every time you create a new jQuery object it gets an id.</p>

<pre><code>if ($.data(a) == $.data(b)) {
    // the same object!
}
</code></pre>

<p>Though, the same could be achieved with a simple <code>a === b</code>, the above might at least show the next developer exactly what you're testing for.</p>

<p>In any case, that's probably not what you're after. If you wanted to check if two different jQuery objects contain the same set of elements, the you could use this:</p>

<pre><code>$.fn.equals = function(compareTo) {
  if (!compareTo || this.length != compareTo.length) {
    return false;
  }
  for (var i = 0; i &lt; this.length; ++i) {

"<p>Let me explain.</p>

<p>Normally when hidden fields are passed from a form to the page specified in the action of the form, those hidden fields can be accessed on the processing page like so:</p>

<p>The Form:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form action=""process.php"" method=""POST""&gt;
   &lt;input type=""text"" name=""username"" /&gt;
   &lt;input type=""password"" name=""password"" /&gt;

   &lt;input type=""hidden"" name=""loginTime"" value=""1:23PM"" /&gt;
   &lt;input type=""hidden"" name=""userIp"" value=""173.23.22.5"" /&gt;

   &lt;input type=""submit"" name=""submit"" value=""Submit"" /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Processing Page (process.php):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

   if isset($_POST['submit']) {

      echo $_POST['username'];

      echo $_POST['loginTime'];
      echo $_POST['userIp'];
   }

?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You see how I had to call the two hidden fields by name and individually. Is there any way I can call all hidden fields that are passed to a page from a form all at once despite what the field names of those are or how many there are? </p>

<p>In other words how do I make PHP do this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>// echo the contents of all hidden
  fields here (if there were any)</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>EDIT</h2>

<p>Additional info:</p>

<p>The form is designed in such a way (not the one above of course) that field names will be of the following sort:</p>

<pre><code>product_name_1
product_quantity_1
product_price_1

product_name_2
product_quantity_2
product_price_2
</code></pre>

<p>and so incremented so on...</p>

<p>Depending on the user action there can be 3 hidden fields or thousands, there are no limits.</p>
","9021","","<p>there's no way to tell the type of the input built-in, so instead you'll need to come up with a way to identify the ones you want yourself. This can be done either by coming up with a special naming scheme, or by storing a list of the names of the hidden fields in another field. I'd recommend the former option, since you don't have the risk of losing data integrity somehow. Look at using <a href=""http://php.net/array_filter"" rel=""nofollow""><code>array_filter</code></a> to parse through the array to get the specially-named fields out.</p>

"<p>I am trying to validate a twitter url, so that at least it contains a username. I do not care if it exists or not, just that there is one.</p>

","9021","","<p>It's because of the way you're defining the regex by using a string literal. You need to escape the escape characters (double backslash):</p>

<p>In the above, I also changed the start so that it would match <code>http://www.twitter.com/test_user</code>.</p>

"<p>my company wants to set up a small intranet portal on LAN. We are about 100 users at max. I am thinking about Joomla on a windows server environment with XAMPP.</p>

","9021","","<p>XAMPP is just a handy single-click installer for Apache/MySQL/PHP which is all you need to run Joomla. This stack powers some of the largest websites on the net, so I don't think you'll run into any problems there. The specs of the server are what you should be most concerned about, but any low-range server should be able to handle that capacity without blinking.</p>

<p>Just be aware that the default settings used by XAMPP are specifically designed for developers working on their own local machines: there's no root password for MySQL, permissions are very relaxed, etc. Take some time to go through the config after you set it up.</p>

<p>I want to get string after <code>""width=""</code> and before <code>"" ""</code>, which is <code>600</code>.</p>

<p>How can I do this?</p>
","9021","","<p>I agree with lonesomeday, in that it feels like there's a nicer solution here if you could give us some more context, but that said, I'll give my two cents.</p>

<p>You could try something like this:</p>

<pre><code>var str = ""width=600 height=1200"";
$('&lt;div ' + str + '&gt;').attr('width');
</code></pre>

<p>This means that you're leveraging the HTML parser to get a sensible result out of your string.</p>

<hr>

<p>Update with the info you posted in the OP comments:</p>

<p>You want to check this string for the width attribute:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EMBED 
    height=311 type=application/x-shockwave-flash
    width=700 src=http://www.youtube.com/v/0O2Rq4HJBxw
    allowfullscreen=""true"" allowscriptaccess=""always""
    wmode=""transparent""&gt;
&lt;/EMBED&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, I'd actually strongly recommend using the above approach.</p>

<pre><code>var str = ""&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EMBED height ... etc"";
$(str).find('embed').attr('width');
</code></pre>

<p>I'll save you the obligatory link to the ""Don't use a regex to parse HTML"" rant/freakout answer, but it definitely applies here.</p>

"<p>I need to optimize the loading speed of several existing websites. One of the issues that I have is the amount of requests per page. The websites have 7 or more different types of pages which should load different set of css and javascripts because they contain different widgets or functionality. Currently each widget or functionality has its own javascript file. I am planning to <strong>combine and minify</strong> the files to have fewer requests.</p>

<ol>
<li>Would it be a good practice to combine and minify all javascripts necessary on each type of page into one file (and to do the same for css)? e.g.
<ul>
<li>home page has just one <code>homepage.js</code>,</li>
<li>list pages have just <code>listing.js</code>,</li>
<li>detail pages have just <code>detail.js</code>,</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Is it better to combine only those files which are always used together? e.g.
<ul>
<li><code>jquery.js</code> + <code>jquery.cookie.js</code> + <code>common.js</code>,</li>
<li><code>list.js</code> + <code>paging.js</code> + <code>favorite.js</code>,</li>
<li><code>detail.js</code> + <code>favorite.js</code>,</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What about having one file for all javascripts that should load in the head and one file for all javascripts that should load at the end of body, e.g.
<ul>
<li><code>init.js</code> goes to <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> and <code>do.js</code> goes to <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What about having one file for common functions and one for administrative functions which is loaded if the user has specific permissions? </li>
<li>Are there any strategies how to balance between 1., 2., 3., and 4.?</li>
<li>What is a recommended amount of javascript and css requests for a page?</li>
</ol>

<p>I am considering large-scale websites a.k.a. portals or social networks. </p>

<p>(BTW, there are some libraries which requests I can't control, e.g. TinyMCE or google maps).</p>
","9021","","<p>Like some others have said, put used-on-more-than-one-page scripts all together into a <code>main.js</code> and then if there are page specific ones: <code>home.js</code>, <code>another_page.js</code>, etc.</p>

<p>The only thing I really wanted to add was that for libraries like jQuery, you should use something like Google's <a href=""http://code.google.com/apis/libraries/devguide.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Libraries API</a>. </p>

<ul>
<li>If your user has visited a different site which also uses Google's servers for the libraries, then they'll arrive with a primed cache! Win!</li>
<li>I'm going to go out on a limb here and bet that Google's servers are faster than yours.</li>
<li>Because the requests are going to different servers, clients can simultaneously process two requests to the Google servers (eg: jQuery &amp; jQuery UI) as well as two requests to your servers (main.js &amp; main.css)</li>
</ul>

<p>ADDITIONAL INFO</p>

<p>The a tags that I'm trying to add the 'active' state / css class to are thumb images that when hovered have a mouseover event that display that thumb in that page, and the thumbs have no link.  </p>

<p>The mouseover event calls a JS function that displays the correct product image.</p>

<pre><code>function displayImage(index, parent){
var images = document.getElementById(parent).getElementsByTagName(""div"");

for(var i = 0; i &lt; images.length; i++) {
  var image = images[i];
  if (image.className != 'pimage')  { continue }
  if(i == index-1) {
    image.style.display=""block"";
  }
  else {
    image.style.display=""none"";
  }     
}

","9021","","<p>I'd try to be more clear in your code about what you're trying to do. If you're trying to only apply a class to a certain link, then only select that link:</p>

    .addClass('selectedThumb')
;

<p>If this was something you particularly needed to select often, it might be neat to extend jQuery:</p>

<pre><code>$.extend($.expr[':'], {
    currentPage: function(el) {

","9021","","<p>As roe said, there's no difference in the end, but it allows to you to use otherwise reserved keywords or invalid identifiers:</p>

<pre><code>var x = { 'a b c' : 1, 'a%#!6!#' : 1};
</code></pre>

<p>It probably isn't a bad idea to always use quotes. Different javascript engines consider different things to be reserved. For example, this works fine in a browser, but causes a syntax error in Rhino:</p>

<pre><code>var x = { native : true };
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Dot notation</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>some_object.property</code></p>
  
  <p><code>property</code> must be a valid JavaScript identifier, i.e. a sequence of alphanumerical characters, also including the underscore (""_"") and dollar sign (""$""), that cannot start with a number. For example, object.$1 is valid, while object.1 is not. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Bracket notation</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>some_object[property]</code></p>
  
  <p><code>property</code> is a string. The string does not have to be a valid identifier; it can have any value, e.g. ""1foo"", ""!bar!"", or even "" "" (a space).</p>

","9021","","<p>Yes, the value of the iterator is the name of the property. It's highly frowned upon to use it to loop over arrays, however. For example, consider this:</p>

<pre><code>x = ['a', 'b', 'c'];

x.foo = 'bar';

for (i in x) alert(i);  // 0, 1, 2, foo
</code></pre>

<p>It's intended for iterating over the members of an object:</p>

<pre><code>x = { a : 'apple', b : 'banana', c : 'carrot' };

for (i in x) {
    // and it's best to check that the property actually exists
    // on this object, not just on one of its prototypal ancestors:
    if (x.hasOwnProperty(i)) {
        alert(i);  // 'a', 'b', 'c'
    }

"<p>I was wondering the other day when typing you selectors in jQuery would it make a difference in performance if you specify your selectors very specific or very loosely.</p>

<p>E.g</p>

<pre><code>$('$myId .someElement')
</code></pre>

<p>Or  </p>

<pre><code>$('table#myId &gt; tbody &gt; tr &gt; td &gt; div.someElement');
</code></pre>

<p>Would the 2nd option be a lot quicker or would the difference be neglectable, say when doing <code>.each()</code> if you need to find the same element over and over.</p>
","9021","","<p>The second one will be faster, since it knows exactly what to look for at each step.</p>

<p>In this example:</p>

<pre><code>$('table#myId &gt; tbody &gt; tr &gt; td &gt; div.someElement');
</code></pre>

<p>If there were no tbody, or no tr, or no td (etc), it could shortcut out of the search straight away. Also, every subsequent step will narrow down the search (eg: not searching inside the <code>&lt;thead&gt;</code>). Compare to this example:</p>

<pre><code>$('#myId .someElement')
</code></pre>

<p>This would have to scan <em>every</em> sub-element of <code>#myId</code>.</p>

<hr>

<p><em>Edit</em>: As FelixKing pointed out, your first example <code>$('#myId .someElement')</code> is actually <strong>faster</strong>. Only marginally, but still, faster, so I thought I should respond. Using the child selector (<code>&gt;</code>), as opposed to the descendant selector (a space) is the fastest traversal method, since the possible set of elements is much less. However, modern browsers have highly optimised built-in methods which jQuery can sometimes make use of, actually reducing the execution time. So, as seen in this particular case, the 'worse' one is actually better, since the browsers are better optimised for executing that particular query. In general however, the original point still stands, particularly if you're using something which couldn't possibly be optimised by browsers (custom selectors, for example).</p>

<p>After using this syntax liberally in my js files, I ran one of the files through <a href=""http://www.jslint.com/"">jsLint</a>, and it freaked out:</p>

<p>After reading through <a href=""http://www.jslint.com/lint.html"">jsLint's explanation of its behavior</a>, it looks like jsLint doesn't really like the <code>new Array()</code> syntax, and instead prefers <code>[]</code> when declaring arrays.</p>

<p>So I have a couple questions.  First, why?  Am I running any risk by using the <code>new Array()</code> syntax instead?  Are there browser incompatibilities that I should be aware of?

"<p>Here is the contradictory output printed by jQuery in the Firebug console, when I was doing some debugging on a page that did not behave the way I had intended:</p>

","9021","","<p>I believe that Firebug adds its own <code>$</code> function as an alias for <code>document.getElementById()</code> which is why <code>$('rbtn_4')</code> found the element with that ID. <em>(Why you need an element with the same class name as its ID is another question though...)</em></p>

<p>This is untested, but you get the idea. Select the elements which you want to search through and then use <code>filter</code> to narrow it down. The initial selector will have a large influence on the speed of this, and you'll also get multiple matches if there are nested elements. Without knowing your circumstances it's hard to recommend anything though - just be aware of these things. Hopefully this is a start.</p>

  <p>For function use <code>nameOfFunction()</code> rather than <code>name_of_function()</code></p>

<p>or </p>

<p>or</p>

  <p>Classes should always start with a capital letter: <code>class Name</code></p>

","9021","","<p>The most common usage of <code>.hover</code> is to pass two functions to it: the first for mouse enter and the second for mouse leave. If you pass just one function, as you have there, then it is executed for both events, and your handler should interrogate the Event object to decide what to do.

"<p>I'm using Doctrine 2 for a project, it'll have a high traffic, and I'm concerned about performance.</p>

<p>Sometimes I'll have to load a lot entities for ""pagination"" purposes.</p>

<p>Example: loading 30,000 published articles and I'll need to paginate these results.</p>

<p>I'm wondering how bad is it to load so much rows from databases where I could use LIMIT OFFSET sql statements, however using Doctrine 2 &amp; Pagination, It'll be much more overhead to implement a Paginator adapter (complex repositories, etc.) where I could use a simple Iterator Adapter.</p>

<p>I guess with a good caching system, it shouldn't be a problem, but I'm not really sure.</p>

<p>By the way, do you have any tips about the cache?</p>
","9021","","<p>I've not used Doctrine before, but almost all the approaches I've seen to pagination <em>definitely</em> do not load the full table of data to do pagination. In the most basic way, you do two queries: one to calculate the number of records (<code>SELECT COUNT(*) ...</code>) and another to get the actual rows you need (<code>SELECT * ... LIMIT ...</code>). MySQL provides a nice simplification of this with <code>SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS</code> and <a href=""http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/information-functions.html#function_found-rows"" rel=""nofollow""><code>FOUND_ROWS</code></a>.</p>

<p>However, I worked on a project once where the data views I needed involved some rather complex joins of several tables with tens of millions of records. Performing the <code>COUNT(*)</code> was taking upwards of 8 seconds per hit. What I ended up doing for pagination was to take a slightly more realistic approach: People don't <em>really</em> use pagination. I mean, you don't go past page one 99% of the time, right? The amount of people who would go past page 10 is minuscule, so I changed my query to select the first <code>pageSize * 10 + 1</code> records (201, in my case). If the number of records found was 201, then I simply printed <code>""You are on page 1 of 'lots'""</code>.</p>

"<p>I'v got a page that list my contacts, every contact is wrapped in a div that onClick opens a modal dialog that shows more info about that contact.</p>

<p>NOW, on the page every contact is listed with name and email, and as said above clicking on a users ""box"" will result in a dialog being shown. But i want it so that when i click on the email (link of course) that the dialog does not show and default mailhandler opens instead. </p>

<p>The way it works now default mail handler (outlook) opens AND the user dialog opens too... I've tried to destroy and close the dialog when i click on the email but the dialog is probably opened after...</p>

<p>Any good fix?</p>

<p>EDIT: I think I have some good answers, but it need some adoption... what if the code on my page looked like this:</p>

    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

<p>So when i click the userMail the onClick on the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> is also run but I don' want that.</p>
","9021","","<p>You can select the mail links and in their handler, cancel the event propagation.</p>

<p>Assuming a HTML layout like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""popupOpener""&gt;
    &lt;a href=""mailto:me@example.com""&gt;mail me&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then try this code:</p>

<pre><code>$('div.popupOpener').click(function () {
    openPopup();
});

$('a[href^=""mailto:""]').click(function (e) {
    e.stopPropagation();
});
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Update in response to edit:</p>

<p>You should avoid attaching events to elements in that way. You are already using jQuery, and it excels at this exact task. Change your HTML to look like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ul id=""users""&gt;
    &lt;li data-userId=""usersId""&gt; &lt;!-- I assume this is coming from the server --&gt;
        blablala
        &lt;a href=""mailto:usersMail""&gt;usersMail&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And then this jQuery will work:</p>

<pre><code>$('#users')
    .children('li')
    .click(function () {
        openPopup($(this).data('userId'));  // not 100% sure on the syntax here
    })
    .children('a')
    .click(function (e) {
        e.stopPropagation(); // this stops the event from going any further (and 
                             // reaching the &lt;li&gt;, but doesn't stop the default
                             // browser behaviour (which is to open the link)

"<p>Hey, I'm making a Web Based anagram game for fun and practice. The game presents the player with a word and the player needs only to construct new words out of letters contained in the given word. Where I am running into trouble is spellchecking the submitted words for validation purposes.</p>

<p>I initially thought that this would be fairly trivial, and my first solution was to just copy the dictionary file that is located at usr/share/dict and compare the submitted answers to the words in that file. This however fails when dealing with different forms of a word. For instance, the dictionary has the word ""ask"", but if the user were to enter the word ""asks"", it would be considered wrong.</p>

<p>Knowing that I can't hope to write a functional spellchecking algorithm (nor do I want to spend the time trying to tackle that) I thought that I may be able to use the browsers built in spell checking capabilities. But my searching for an answer to this hasn't produced any useful results.</p>

","9021","","<p>If your table uses the MyISAM engine, running <code>COUNT(*)</code> is an O(1) operation as it keeps a cached value of the total number of rows.</p>

<p>Even if you weren't using that, or had a slightly different query, I doubt that doing a single <code>COUNT</code> would be a bottleneck in the system.</p>

<p>If it really were a huge issue <em>(and I would suggest testing on a table with an amount of fake data that you would expect first)</em>, one option is to take a slightly more pragmatic approach to it. It might be different for your users in your use case, however, accept that <strong>no one really uses pagination anyway</strong>. At most, you could expect someone to go through 2 or 3 pages before giving up. Use filtering and sorting to push the data the user wants up to the first page.</p>

<p>However, even with filtering and sorting, you'd still need to show <em>some</em> sort of pagination probably, so you could take this approach: Given a page size of 15 records, select the first 151 (15 per page * 10 pages + 1) records and count how many you get. If the number is less than that, then show ""Page 1 of 8"" or whatever. If the number is 151, then you have more than 10 pages, so show ""Page 1 of lots"". This is an approach I used on a table which had ~12 million records and it worked very well.</p>

<p>In applications using jQuery, I've noticed a tendency to, say, change the contents of a drop-down using <code>$(...).html()</code> to switch out the underlying nodes, rather than using <a href=""http://ln.hixie.ch/?start=1161042744&amp;order=-1&amp;count=1"" rel=""nofollow""><code>element.options[]</code></a>.

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I guess part of the question includes if the older features are reliable cross-browser. I remember that, once upon a time, IE would add <code>&lt;tbody&gt;</code> tags automatically to your table, while firefox would not. That made walking the dom tree painful cross-browser. Similarly, <code>element.options[]</code> had <a href=""http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/w3c_html.html#t20"" rel=""nofollow"">problems when changing the options in the collection</a>.

","9021","","<p><em>I'll start by saying that I don't know of any ""official"" statements like ""DOM Level 0 considered harmful"". This is just my own opinion.</em></p>

<p>I think it depends on the case.</p>

<p>The issue I have is that it is problematic, especially with dynamically generated/modified documents, to target specific elements using the collections like <code>documents.forms</code> or <code>documents.images</code>. Every time I see someone write <code>document.forms[0]</code>, I cringe.</p>

<p>Current, and even not-so-current browsers provide the ability via functions like <code>getElementsByTagName</code> to simulate the same behaviour, but in a more generic and reusable way. Of course, when you add jQuery into the mix, then there's <em>no reason at all</em> to use those collections.</p>

<p>The exceptions I have though, are when you are working in a non-jQuery environment and you're accessing things like <code>selectElement.options</code> or <code>tbodyElement.rows</code>. In those cases, it really is simpler when you're doing basic stuff like adding or removing items.</p>

"<p>I've just had a discussion with my teammate about the location of user uploaded images in an image gallery. I would like a broader insight on the methods we suggest.</p>

<p>My teammate wrote a controller + action that calls <code>file_get_contents</code> on an image file placed in a folder that's not available for public browsing (i.e., outside <code>public_html</code> on the server), and echoes it via a header. This is secure, but since we use Zend Framework, it's also crawling slow - each call to the image controller costs us approx 500ms of lag due to the bootstrap's queries being executed. It's annoying since the picture gallery view displays over 20 images at the same time.</p>

<p>In short, the relevant code would be:</p>

<pre><code>class ImageController extends Zend_Controller_Action {
    public function showAction () {
        $filename = addslashes($this-&gt;_getParam('filename'));
        if(!is_file($filename)) {
            $filename = APPLICATION_PATH.'/../public/img/nopicture.jpg';
        }
        $this-&gt;_helper-&gt;viewRenderer-&gt;setNoRender(true);
        $this-&gt;view-&gt;layout()-&gt;disableLayout();
        $img = file_get_contents($filename);
        header('Content-Type: image/jpeg');
        $modified = new Zend_Date(filemtime($filename));
        $this-&gt;getResponse()
             -&gt;setHeader('Last-Modified',$modified-&gt;toString(Zend_Date::RFC_1123))
             -&gt;setHeader('Content-Type', 'image/jpeg')
             -&gt;setHeader('Expires', '', true)
             -&gt;setHeader('Cache-Control', 'public', true)
             -&gt;setHeader('Cache-Control', 'max-age=3800')
             -&gt;setHeader('Pragma', '', true);
        echo $img;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then, in a view, we just call:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;img src=""&lt;?php echo $this-&gt;url(array('controller' =&gt; 'image', 'action' =&gt; 'show', 'filename' =&gt; PATH_TO_HIDDEN_LOCATION.'/filename.jpg')); ?&gt;"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I have a different approach: I prefer to keep the original images in a hidden location, but as soon as they are requested, copy them to a public location and provide a link to it (with an extra mechanism, run by cron, to wipe the public images directory every now and then in order not to waste space, and a <code>robots.txt</code> telling Google not to index the directory). The solution places files (a few at every given moment) in a publicly accessible directory (provided one knows the filename), but also requires only a view helper, thus not launching the bootstrap:</p>

<pre><code>class Zend_View_Helper_ShowImage extends Zend_View_Helper_Abstract {
    public function showImage ($filename) {
        if (!file_exists(PUBLIC_PATH.""/img/{$filename}"")) {
            if (!copy(PATH_TO_HIDDEN_FILES.""/{$filename}"",PUBLIC_PATH.""/img/{$filename}""))
                $url = PUBLIC_PATH.'/img/nopicture.jpg';
            else
                $url = PUBLIC_PATH.""/img/{$filename}"";
        } else {
            $url = PUBLIC_PATH.""/img/{$filename}""
        }
        return ""{$url}"";
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>With the aid of this helper, the call is very simple in the view:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;img src=""&lt;?php echo $this-&gt;showImage('filename.jpg'); ?&gt;"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Does my approach pose a security threat, as my coleague states? What are the potential risks of this? And, most importantly, do the security threats, if any, outweigh the 10 seconds gain on page load?</p>

","9021","","<p>Ok, how about another way (<em>this is a tad hacky, too, by the way</em>)</p>

<p>When you go to the gallery page, you will know which images will need to be sent to the user. I'll assume that they have an identifier (filename/id/whatever). Generate a list of all the files required for this request and store that somewhere easily accessible by your scripts, for example, in a text file on the server (not publicly accessible). Give that file an id.</p>

<p>Now, have another PHP file which doesn't load up the full Zend framework. It should get some parameters from the URL: the image file being requested, and the id of the list.</p>

<p>Write the URLs into the <code>img</code> tags like so:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;img src=""image.php?file=myFile.jpg&amp;list=12345"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>image.php</code> file should open the list with that id and check if <code>myFile.jpg</code> exists in it. If so, show it, if not issue a 404.</p>

<p>And don't forget to clean up your old lists regularly.</p>

  If set to yes, the new created window floats below, under its own parent when the parent window is not minimized. alwaysLowered windows are often referred as pop-under windows.

"<p>Continuing my journey into more advanced OO, I'm trying to come up with the best way of being able to create a class called <code>database</code> that can happily use the soon-to-be-deprecated <code>mysql_</code> commands, the <code>mysqli_</code> library, and perhaps further down the line, other flavours of database as well.</p>

<p>I'd like my calling code to look something like this, for simplicity:</p>

<pre><code>$db = new database(""MYSQL"", $host,$user,$password,$databaseName); 
$db-&gt;query(""SELECT myField FROM myTable"");

while ($ROW = $db-&gt;fetch_assoc($QRY)) {
  echo $ROW['myField'] . ""&lt;br/&gt;"";
}
</code></pre>

<p>When instantiating the database object, thats the part where i'd hope to specify MYSQL, MYSQLI, MSSQL, or whatever I feel like adding later.</p>

<p>I appreciate I could achieve exactly what I want by implementing <code>switch</code> blocks in every method of <code>database</code>:</p>

<pre><code>class database() {

  function __construct($type,$host,$user,$password,$databaseName) { 

    $this-&gt;dbType = $type; 

    switch ($type) {

      case ""mysql"":
        mysql_dao::connect($host,$user,$password,$databaseName);
        break;

      case ""mysqli"":
        mysqli_dao::connect($host,$user,$password,$databaseName);
        break;

      case ""mssql"":
        mssql_dao::connect($host,$user,$password,$databaseName);
        break;

      //other cases
    }

  }

  function query($SQL) {  
    switch ($this-&gt;dbType) { 
       case ""mysql"": mysql_dao::query($SQL); break;
       case ""mysqli"": mysqli_dao::query($SQL); break; 
       case ""mssql"": mssql_dao::query($SQL); break;
    }
  }

  function fetch_assoc($SQL) {  
    switch ($this-&gt;dbType) { 
       case ""mysql"": mysql_dao::fetch_assoc($SQL); break;
       case ""mysqli"": mysqli_dao::fetch_assoc($SQL); break; 
       case ""mssql"": mssql_dao::fetch_assoc($SQL); break;
    }
  }

  //other methods....

}
</code></pre>

<p>...But this seems incredibly messy.  Every time a method of <code>database</code> was called, the code is checking what type it is and calling the method from a different object.</p>

<p>So my next solution was simply to omit <code>database</code> at all, and just use calling code that looks like this: </p>

<pre><code>$db = new mysql_dao($host,$user,$password,$databaseName); 
$db-&gt;query(""SELECT myField FROM myTable"");

while ($ROW = $db-&gt;fetch_assoc($QRY)) {
  echo $ROW['myField'] . ""&lt;br/&gt;"";
}
</code></pre>

<p>...and so we just call the database access object for the type of database we're using, but I don't like that either, if I wanted to shift a whole project from mysql to mysqli, i'd have to seek out all of these object references and change them.  Although this is fairly trivial in a modern PHP editor, it still doesn't feel like it should be the best way (i'm starting to get theoretical instead of practical, now!)</p>

<p>So finally, i'd hoped that I could build the <code>database</code> class with a single switch statement:</p>

<pre><code>class database {

    function __construct($type,$host,$user,$pass,$db) {    

        switch ($type) {

            default:
            case ""MYSQL"":
                return new mysql_dao($host,$user,$pass,$db);
                break;

            case ""MYSQLI"":
                return new mysqli_dao($host,$user,$pass,$db);
                break;

            case ""MSSQL"":
                return new mssql_dao($host,$user,$pass,$db);
                break;    
        }    

    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>... and then just implement an interface with all of the other methods being in the classes for the individual database types.  Unfortunately this isn't working either because even though the constructor for <code>database</code> returns an instance of another object, I can't call <code>database-&gt;query</code> because the method doesn't exist in the database object.</p>

<p>As far as I could work out, extending <code>database</code> with <code>mysql_dao</code> / <code>mysqli_dao</code> etc. classes wasn't right either, since you have to call the extended class to use its methods, and I want to call the parent class but use the methods of the child class.  So this suggests that <code>database</code> should extend the <code>dao</code> classes, but you can't have one child class with multiple potential parents (can you?)</p>

<p>To conclude - I am almost sure I am missing something, and that what I want to do should be both possible and quite straightforward, and I just haven't thought of the right way - can anyone give me a pointer?</p>

"<p>So, in answering another question on this site, I wrote a class for someone to create a BitArray instance in JavaScript.  The code I posted looked like this:</p>

<pre><code>var foo = function(param1) {
    this._member = param1;
    this.getMember = function() { return this._member; };
    this.setMember = function(val) { this._member = val; };
    this.alertMember = function() { alert(this._member); };
    foo.STATIC_CONSTANT = ""some value"";
}
</code></pre>

<p>One of the comments I received was a rather stern ""You should absolutely add the methods to foo.prototype instead of this"".  If I take that criticism and apply it to the above, it turns the code into:</p>

<pre><code>var foo = function(param1) {
    this._member = param1;
}
foo.prototype.getMember = function(){ return this._member; };
foo.prototype.setMember = function(val) { this._member = val; };
foo.prototype.alertMember = function() { alert(this._member); };
foo.STATIC_CONSTANT = ""some value"";
</code></pre>

<p>My question is, what's the difference here between the two approaches assuming foo will never be subclassed?  </p>

<p>To be clear, I'm not advocating writing sloppy code - I credit the commentor with catching me being sloppy - but as I was conceeding to his correctness, it really did make me think - why should I prototype if I'm creating an effectively sealed class? </p>

<p>Is there some performance or functional consequence I'm missing here?  Or when a class won't be subclassed is using the prototype irrelevent?</p>
","9021","","<p>Yes, there is a difference.</p>

<p>In the first example, every single time you create a new instance of the class, its methods are redefined. This makes it very much less efficient in terms of speed and memory.</p>

<p>To illustrate:</p>

<pre><code>function C1 () {
    this.foo = function () { };
}

function C2 () {}
C2.prototype.foo = function () {};

c1a = new C1();
c1b = new C1();

c2a = new C2();
c2b = new C2();

c1a.foo === c1b.foo;  // false
c2a.foo === c2b.foo;  // true

This optional display width may be used by applications to display integer values having a width less than the width specified for the column by left-padding them with spaces. (That is, this width is present in the metadata returned with result sets. Whether it is used or not is up to the application.)</p>
  
  <p>The display width does not constrain the range of values that can be stored in the column. Nor does it prevent values wider than the column display width from being displayed correctly. For example, a column specified as SMALLINT(3) has the usual SMALLINT range of -32768 to 32767, and values outside the range permitted by three digits are displayed in full using more than three digits. </p>

","9021","","<p>It looks like you (or some other code you've included) have added extra properties onto the Array prototype. What you should be doing is checking to see whether the object you're iterating over actually has that property on <em>itself</em>, not on its prototype:</p>

","9021","","<p>If you want to find an item in an array, you'll have to iterate over it.

"<p>In jQuery, let's say we have 2 ways to navigate through the DOM elements;</p>

<ol>
<li>Is the return type same in both the cases?</li>
<li>What is the difference in navigating through the DOM in both the

<p>So, to answer your question generally, if you use the standard CSS selectors in a jQuery query, then it is possible that jQuery can hand off the searching to the browser if it is supported. If you use the jQuery functions, then these sort of shortcuts can't be done. My general rule of thumb is to use CSS selectors whenever possible, except when it hurts legibility.</p>

"<p>So I saw a function that was, quite frankly beautiful in its simplicity as it allowed you to find the global object ( which depending on environ at the time may NOT have been window ) while within an anonymous function; however when you throw javascripts' ""use strict""; mode it crumbles, due to the evaluation of the keyword 'this' changing. There were a few ways to accomplish this?</p>

    case 7 : return function (a,b,c,d,e,f,g) { return fn.apply(this, arguments); };
    case 8 : return function (a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h) { return fn.apply(this, arguments); };
    case 9 : return function (a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i) { return fn.apply(this, arguments); };
    default : return function (a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j) { return fn.apply(this, arguments); };

","9021","","<p>+1 to jfriend00's answer, but I thought I'd chime in to explain <em>why</em> yours wasn't working in the first place.</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/"" rel=""nofollow"">jQuery ""constructor""</a> has three method signatures (essentially):</p>

<ol>
<li><code>$(selector[, context])</code> for creating a jQuery object out of existing elements</li>
<li><code>$(html[, ownerDocument])</code> for creating new elements</li>
<li><code>$(callback)</code> as an alias for <code>$(document).ready(callback)</code></li>
</ol>

<p>You're using the first option, and <code>selector</code> is a pre-existing jQuery object (which is fine), however by adding the <code>bar</code> argument, that means that it is treating that element as the <strong>context</strong>. Essentially: ""give me a result set containing all the elements <code>foo</code> <em>which exist inside</em> the element <code>bar</code>"".</p>

<p>Also, if you <em>know</em> that you already have a jQuery object in a variable, it's just wasteful to wrap it another call to <code>$()</code>.</p>

<pre><code>bar = $('#bar');
$(bar).show();  // unnecessary!
bar.show();     // better!
</code></pre>

<p>To help me remember, I always prefix jQuery variables with $:</p>

<pre><code>$bar = $(""#bar"");
$bar.show(); // less ambiguous! woo!

"<p>I have something simple I'm trying to accomplish with less repetition.</p>

    if($y != 1) {

        echo $displayBlock;     
    }

} else {

    echo $displayBlock;

}

<p>But even still, I have a feeling that there is a way to do this whole if if else thing which I can't see right now.</p>

<p>How do you accomplish the above with less if statements? So: if $x != 1 (default), then show the displayBlock. if $x == 1, and $y != 1, then show the display block. If $x == 1 &amp;&amp; $y == 1, then do <em>not</em> show the displayBlock.</p>

"<pre><code>a = $('div:first');
b = $('div');

<p><code>b</code> may contain multiple DOM elements.</p>

<p>But <code>a</code> only contains 1 element.</p>

<p>How do I know if <code>a</code> is the last element of <code>b</code>?</p>

<p>I tried <code>a == $('div:last')</code>,but it's wrong after my test.</p>

<p>And if <code>a</code> is an element of <code>b</code>, how do I get the sibling of <code>a</code> within <code>b</code>?</p>

<p><strong>Clarify</strong></p>

<p>the problem is how I can write a <code>is_a_last_of_b(a, b)</code> to check whether <code>a</code> is the last child of <code>b</code>.</p>

<p>And if <code>a</code> is a direct child of <code>b</code>,how to write <code>next_sibling(a)</code> to return the next sibling of <code>a</code>(only one)?</p>
","9021","","<p>Ok, to compare jquery objects, you can look at some other questions on SO like this one: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3176962/jquery-object-equality"">jQuery object equality</a></p>

<p>Essentially, in your case where you only want to check for one item you could do this:</p>

<pre><code>var a = $(""div:first""),
    b = $(""div"");

if (b[b.length - 1] === a[0]) {}

// or

if (b.last()[0] = a[0]) {}
</code></pre>

<p>Then, to get the next sibling of an element:</p>

<pre><code>b = b.next();

","9021","","<p>As the others have said, you'll have to do this in Javascript, since it'll be on the client side. I'll assume that you're not using a library such as jQuery or Prototype on this page, and if this is all you're doing, it'd be massive overkill to use one of them.</p>

<p>First, add a HTML element which will contain your total:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;Total: &lt;span id=""total""&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The bit of information you really need to know however, is the weight which corresponds to each checkbox. The simplest method would be to store it on the checkbox element itself. Add an attribute called <code>data-weight</code>. eg:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type=""checkbox"" name=""check[]"" value=""12"" data-weight=""1234"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then, add some javascript:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;
    (function () {
        var totalEl = document.getElementById('total'),
            total = 0,
            checkboxes = document.form1['check[]'],
            handleClick = function () {
                total += parseInt(this['data-weight'], 10) * (this.checked ? 1 : -1);
                totalEl.innerHTML = total;
            },
            i, l
        ;
        for (i = 0, l = checkboxes.length; i &lt; l; ++i) {
            checkboxes[i].onclick = handleClick;
        }
    }());
&lt;/script&gt;

"<p>I have the following function to style list elements:</p>

<pre><code>function styleRows() {
    $("".pretty-list li"").removeClass(""even-row"").removeClass(""odd-row"");
    $("".pretty-list li:even"").addClass(""even-row"");
    $("".pretty-list li:odd"").addClass(""odd-row"");
}
</code></pre>

<p>I then give any <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> i want styled the 'pretty-list' class and all is fine. However I have various bits of JS that fadeout/remove rows and I then call this function to restyle the rows. The count though continues on through each different <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>, so if there's 2 lists and the first ends on an odd row then the second will start on an even - I want each styled element to start with an odd row.</p>

<p>Is it possible then to tell jQuery/JS to reset the count after it completes each element? Thanks for any help.</p>
","9021","","<p>You just need to split it up like so:</p>

<pre><code>$("".pretty-list"").each(function () {
    $(this).find(""li"").removeClass(""even-row odd-row"")
        .filter("":even"").addClass(""even-row"").end()
        .filter("":odd"").addClass(""odd-row"");
});
</code></pre>

<p>Using the <code>each</code> function there is the important bit. I've also added a few more touches which (if they work -- it's untested) should hopefully make it a bit more efficient.</p>

<p>It's also worth noting that <a href=""http://caniuse.com/#search=nth-child"" rel=""nofollow"">all modern browsers</a> support what you're doing with plain CSS which is much easier to maintain.</p>

    /* your 'even' styles */ 
}
.pretty-list li {
    /* your 'odd' styles */
}

Any help will be deeply appreciated thank you. </p>

<p>ok here is an example of the file's contents:</p>

<p>and im adding the total bandwidth consumed by the file requested over the month.</p>
","9021","","<p>it looks like your <code>$details</code> variable has less than 9 elements in it. Therefore, when you try to access <code>$details[8]</code> that doesn't exist, and there's your error.</p>

<p>To fix it, I'd debug your other variables, specifically the <code>$line</code> variable. It looks like there's (at least) one line in the file you're opening which isn't in the format you're expecting. Note that this may well be an empty line at the end or something.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>The next bit is where I am getting stuck.
Because they want a lease price as well I thought I would just check when the relevant checkboxes are checked and fill another variable for each and then add them up.
But for some reason it only works if I have any one of the check boxes check but not more than one, if I have more than one check it gives me NaN in the lease total.</p>

<p>The bottom part of the javascript just adds the totals up and then limits then to 2 decimal places.</p>

<p>I'm sure my javascript is a bit crude and maybe I'm doing something obviously wrong.</p>
","9021","","<p>As PointedEars pointed out, you're adding strings together here. The <code>+</code> operator works with both strings and numbers. If either side of the equation is a string, the two parts are <strong>concatenated</strong>, if both are numbers, only then are they <strong>added</strong>.</p>

<pre><code>var str  = ""3.3"";
var num1 = 1.1;
var num2 = 1.2;

str + str;   // String: ""3.33.3""
str + num1;  // String: ""3.31.1""
num1 + num2; // Number: 2.3
</code></pre>

<p>Then, when you multiply your string, the result is coerced to a number, however, in your case, because your string is something like ""3.33.3"", that is an invalid number and hence, the result is NaN</p>

<pre><code>""3.33.3"" * 2 // NaN
</code></pre>

<p>The answer is to make sure you're working with numbers in the first place. Change all the places you define a numeric string to an actual number:</p>

<pre><code>var lease_sorting_stapling255 = 25.88;
</code></pre>

<p>Or, if the values are coming from your form, you might have to parse them into a number. For this, you can use <code>parseInt</code> or <code>parseFloat</code> depending if you want decimal places or not.</p>

<pre><code>parseFloat(""25.88"");  // 25.88
parseInt(""25.88"", 10);  // 25
</code></pre>

<p>The second argument to parseInt is very important, since that defines the base for the number. Without it, the number could be parsed as octal or hexadecimal.</p>

<pre><code>parseInt(""007"");  // 7
parseInt(""008"");  // 8
parseInt(""009"");  // 9
parseInt(""010"");  // 8 !!
parseInt(""010"", 10); // 10

"<p>I would like to replace the Javascript confirm() function to allow custom buttons instead of Yes/Cancel. I tried searching but all the solutions are event driven such as jquery dialog(where the code does not wait for a response but it is event driven). Does anyone know of a non-event driven solution. It must work in Safari as well as IE (so no vbscript).</p>

<p>Here is sample code in many parts of my system. This is old code and was not designed with event driven windows in mind. I am trying to avoid a rewrite.</p>

<pre><code>**


// Wait for users response
if (result&gt;2000) {
    if (confirm(""Are you sure this is right?"")){

       ... do stuff

    } 
 }
 ... continue with other stuff
 ... lots of other code.

 if (confirm(""Did you double check your numbers?"")){

       ... do more stuff

 } else {
      ... do something
 }
</code></pre>

<p>** </p>
","9021","","<p>Like the others have said, this isn't possible. <code>confirm</code> is a blocking function - no more script is executed until the user has dismissed the dialog - and you can't simulate that with other methods of Javascript.</p>

<p>A better solution would be to structure your code for asynchronous execution. This is almost always a better idea -- firstly, it lets you decide how your dialogs should look, what buttons there are, etc; and secondly, it doesn't block the user. They might have the important information they need to double-check open in another tab, or elsewhere on the page. With <code>confirm</code> they'd have to answer your question before being able to get to either of these places.</p>

<p>Here's a snippet of what the code might look like. There's a lot of blank bits here, but it might put you on the right track:</p>

<pre><code>if (result&gt;2000) {
    displayConfirm(""Are you sure this is right?"", {
        ""Yes"": function () {
            // ... do stuff
        },
        ""No"": function () {
            // do.. nothing? up to you.
        }
    } 
}
</code></pre>

<p>You'll see here that there are two functions defined, but none actually get executed. The <code>displayConfirm</code> function would have to construct a dialog box (in whichever way) and then create buttons, using those functions as the click handlers (or at least, calling them from the click handler).</p>

"<p>One major barrier to creating immersive experiences in the browser (using WebGL and similar) is the set of limitations placed on mouse control. </p>

<p>For instance a first person shooter control scheme essentially requires the program to grab the mouse and re-center it so as to allow infinite movement in any direction for the cursor. This is a no-no because it would give the web programmer too much control. Hopefully one day we will see a plugin that allows a site to request permission to move the mouse to allow this behavior. </p>

<p>However I think there are some ways to improve things without going that far. I am wondering if it's possible to allow access to the mouse position once the mouse moves off of the window (focus is still on window)? </p>

<p>I was playing this game using Google Chrome: <a href=""http://www.chromeexperiments.com/detail/x-wing/?f="" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chromeexperiments.com/detail/x-wing/?f=</a></p>

<p>and my biggest issue was that to get to a corner, I have to carefully keep my mouse on the corner of the browser window. If I push it off the window my ship would stay where the mouse's last window position was, which is not exactly in the corner. And I would crash into the wall. </p>

<p>To make this better, the browser should be able to receive mouse updates when the mouse is outside of the window. In the context of this type of game if the mouse leaves the window it should continue to send updated positions to the browser. </p>

<p>Is there any provision for this? </p>
","9021","","<p>To answer your question, no, you can't get mouse events from outside the window (including its position).</p>

Are you using some plugin to do custom scrolling or is this a pure CSS thing? If you could post a <em>concise</em> example of code which demonstrates the problem, that would help too.</p>

<hr>

<p>Ok, it sounds like it's going to be a problem with the plugin you're using. I'd bet that when it's initialized, it gets the scroll height and stores it, never checking again to see if it changed. Look at the methods which that plugin provides: perhaps there will be a <code>reset</code> or <code>init</code> function which you can manually run to make it check the heights again.</p>

<p>Anyway, I don't know exactly <em>why</em> you'd want that, but Javascript is a flexible language and you could probably get close using a more sane method. It's hard to know exactly what you're trying to achieve, but perhaps this information might get you on the right track:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The arguments which are passed to a function at <em>call</em> time are referenced in a variable named <code>arguments</code>.</p>

  console.log(arguments);
}
f(); // []

<li><p>You can call a function with an arbitrary list of arguments using <code>.apply</code>, which is a method on the Function prototype. It takes 2 parameters. The first is the object which will be <code>this</code> inside the function call, and the second is an array of arguments.</p>

f.apply(null, [1, 2, 3]); [1, 2, 3]

<p>What I have is a users who are voting on products and I am trying to figure out how to put the tables together properly to support this. So I have my users table, my product table, and from that I want to create 2 new tables. One thats actually the votes per product which will have a unique ID per product vote ranking so I can then have a second table that would have comments along with the votes. I could create on large table for the combination of the 2, yes.. but I foresee issues with that down the road as the table grows. So I would rather keep the 2 seperate. Another thing I want to do is keep tabs on the 10 different rank choices. 1/2 being the lowest 5 being the highest with total over all votes. So whats the best way to construct a table for at the least the rating storage per product. </p>

<p>That aside whats the best way to put the numbers in? decimals? whole numbers? how would I calculate the 5 star concept. </p>
","9021","","<p>Three tables (two of which I assume you already have):</p>

products (id, etc...)

Unless you foresee users wanting to give something 3.1415 stars, that should be quite sufficient, plus more memory efficient than a <code>float</code> column.</p>

<p>Then, when you want to find the average score:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT AVERAGE(rating) FROM votes WHERE productId = xxx
</code></pre>

<p>I don't think that you should have any particular problems with a table structure like that. If you were being super-amazingly-paranoid, then yes, you could create a separate table for the comments, however, that would be the textbook definition of premature optimisation.</p>

  <li>Backbone.js for lightweight MV*</li>
  <li>Require.js + AMD + RequireJS text add-on (to assist with external template management)</li>
  <li>Backbone.js LayoutManager (if you require some more intelligent layout management)</li>
  <li>jQuery for DOM manip.</li>
  <li>Handlebars.js for templating, unless you're doing something simple, in which case, opt for Underscore's Micro-templating</li>
  <li>r.js for handling script optimization</li>
  <li>Jasmine + Jenkins for testing and CI</li>
  <li>Node.js + Express (speaking of Node, Miller Medeiros has an excellent write-up on how to use it as a build script)</li>
  <li>MongoDB as a noSQL data-store</li>

"<p>I have a link that loads dynamic content into a div... there need to be a ton of additional ajax actions within that newly loaded dynamic content. Do I have to create a new delegate function for each of those actions in my success handler? (Does the delegate function, ideally belong in the success handler?) How can I consolidate these functions?</p>

<p>For example, I click the ""view posts"" button on the main screen.  It loads in a bunch of posts into a modal window.  Within that window, for example, there may be a 'view comments' button for each post, which makes its own ajax call and loads the comments directly into the modal window.</p>

<p>The two things I would like clarification on are what is the best practice for organizing these delegate functions.  Secondly, when is delegate required/when is it not required?</p>

<p>Edit: Thanks guys. These were all great answers.  I'm going to choose Ohgodwhy's answer because he only has 245 rep.</p>
","9021","","<p>It's all about event bubbling. Consider the following HTML structure:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Here's a 
            &lt;a&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;
            and
            &lt;a&gt;another&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If you were to click on the 'another' link, you're actually clicking on the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>, the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tags too, since they're nested inside each other. This is what <code>.delegate</code> leverages to make events on dynamically added content simple. Let's say you attach a delegate event to the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element: </p>

<pre><code>$('div').delegate('a', 'click', doSomething);
</code></pre>

<p>This means that when a click event bubbles to the div, it will check whether that same click event 'bubbled through' an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element inside itself and if so, then run the handler. The benefit here obviously is that the content of this div can be dynamic and could be modified after the delegate is added, since the selector is only checked when the event is fired.</p>

","9021","","<p>Adding and removing CSS styles are synchronous functions -- there is no callback because the next statement will be executed once the style has been applied. <em>Rendering</em> of the updated style is slightly different, since that will happen during the next repaint, but unless you're doing some serious number-crunching in your UI code, the difference would be completely unnoticeable.

","9021","","<p>Well, it might help if you show us examples of the values in the <code>$robotsIP</code> array.</p>

<p>Anyway, it sounds like you don't have delimiters in your string though. <code>preg_*</code> regexes need delimiters which are defined by the first character. They can be any non-alphanumeric character (which doesn't have special meaning in the regex?), but most people use <code>/</code> or sometimes I've seen <code>@</code>, especially if the regex itself needs to contain <code>/</code>s. eg:</p>

<pre><code>preg_match(""/fo{2}ba+r/"", $str);
preg_match(""@fo{2}ba+r@"", $str);

"<p>Is it valid to have an HTML form inside of a 'section' tag?</p>

<p>My professor keeps using section tags out the wazoo and I don't think he's always using them appropriately.  Wanted to check on this specific instance.</p>
","9021","","<p>Yes it is valid.</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/sections.html#the-section-element"" rel=""nofollow"">HTML5 spec</a> says that it can contain any flow content, where <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/content-models.html#flow-content"" rel=""nofollow"">flow content is</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Most elements that are used in the body of documents and applications are categorized as flow content.</p>

<p>If was still irking you, you could point him to this note:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The section element is not a generic container element. When an element is needed for styling purposes or as a convenience for scripting, authors are encouraged to use the div element instead. A general rule is that the section element is appropriate only if the element's contents would be listed explicitly in the document's outline.</p>

","9021","","<p>Mustache is pretty solid, but I found it to be a little too hardline about the ""logicless template"" thing. For example, it doesn't offer a lot of small niceties you'd hope for in a templating system, like an ""else"" statement. You have to do dumb stuff like this all the time:</p>

<pre><code>{{#if foo}}
    &lt;span&gt;foo is set&lt;/span&gt;
{{/if}
{{^if foo}}
    &lt;span&gt;foo is not set&lt;/span&gt;
{{/if}}

"<p>Not a full-time jQuery nor Javascript dev so sorry if dumb question. I think I need something like the live function for a swapping of class's I do to handle which value is tied to a selector. </p>

I think this used to happen via the live method. How would I achieve this. I am currently doing it manually but the Javascript runtime doesn't update the event handling correctly.</p>

<p>What javascript would I use to ensure that this worked correctly?</p>

<p>Any help is apprecciated.</p>

<p>thx</p>
","9021","","<p>Firstly, perhaps ""disable"" might be a better word-choice here, but we're not here to nitpick grammar...</p>

<p>I'll assume that when you click the 'unenable' link, it should change to be an 'enable' link:</p>

<pre><code>$('.unenable-item').live('click', function () {
    $(this)
        .removeClass('unenable-item')
        .addClass('enable-item')
        .text('enable');
    doSomethingWith($(this).data('id'));
});
$('.enable-item').live('click', function () {
    // the inverse of the above
});

<p>Here, I used the <a href=""http://api.jquery.com/live"" rel=""nofollow""><code>live</code></a> function which kinda-sorta is like <code>.on</code> or its deprecated alias <code>.bind</code>, except that it doesn't actually attach the event handler to the objects selected by the selector. Instead it attaches a handler to the document and whenever there is a click on anything, it checks the selector then to see if it matches. You could also use <a href=""http://api.jquery.com/delegate/"" rel=""nofollow""><code>.delegate</code></a> for more-targetted matching.

<pre><code>x = {

<p>Even though you don't always need quotes, the left-hand side is treated as a string identifier. It then follows that variables are not evaluated:</p>

x = {
  foo: 'my value'
}
x.bar === undefined;
x.foo === 'my value';

x = {};  // an empty object

"<p>I am working on an application with a firm business requirement to display an html table with up to 60 rows and up to 50 columns.  </p>

<p>Ideally, users would be able to select individual table cells, or click and drag to select multiple cells.  </p>

<p>My problem is that I'm limited to using IE6 at the moment, and I have been having real trouble finding (or coding) a way to allow for this kind of selection on this many cells without severe performance degradation.</p>

<p>My current method looks basically like this:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function() {
    var selecting = false;
    var colStart, rowStart;

    var tableContainer = $(""#tableContainer"")

            var colEnd = theCell.index();
            var rowEnd = theCell.parents(""tr"").index();

            // Account for rowEnd being smaller than rowStart
            var rowSliceStart = Math.min(rowStart, rowEnd);
            var rowSliceEnd = Math.max(rowStart, rowEnd);

            tableContainer.find(""tr"").slice(rowSliceStart, rowSliceEnd + 1).each(function() {
                var colSliceStart = Math.min(colStart, colEnd);
                var colSliceEnd = Math.max(colStart, colEnd);

<p>Does anybody have any suggestions for a method to improve the performance of this function?  I believe the adding/removing of classes is taking up most of the performance overhead, so I'm especially hoping to find efficiencies there.</p>
","9021","","<p>It doesn't actually look too bad. The only thing I could think of off the top of my head would be to calculate just the deltas on mouseover. That is, store the previous start and end columns/rows and on the next mouseover event, update the classes of just the elements which have changed.</p>

<p>Other minor things:</p>

<ul>
<li>cache <code>$(this)</code> in the mousedown handler</li>
<li>I'm not 100% sure about this one for IE6, but you could try changing the selector from <code>.find('td.selected')</code> to just <code>.find('.selected')</code>. The first has two conditions to check, vs just one. In modern browsers, the second would <em>definitely</em> be faster, since jQuery can leverage <code>getElementsByClassName</code>, but that doesn't exist in IE6, so who knows?
<ul>
<li>You could also experiment with making a more targetted selector, especially if the contents of the cells contain further DOM elements. <code>.find('&gt; tr &gt; .selected')</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>throttle the mouseover handler.</li>

"<p>Regarding <a href=""http://cosystudios.com/thecosystudio.co.uk/thecosystudio.html"" rel=""nofollow"">THIS </a>site</p>

<h2>Brief Synopsis</h2>

<p>Clicking on the <em>Listen</em> tab on the left reveals a soundcloud player (several in fact, within a scrollable pane)
Click on play and inspect that closing the panel (using jQuery hide() method) also stops the audio.</p>

<p>From what I knew of the hide() method, the objects are only hidden and not destroyed. Using firefoxs inspector, this seems to be true since i can still view the instance of the soundcloud player after hiding. So why does audio pause?</p>

<h2>Used code</h2>

<p>The jquery that currently affects the 'drawer'</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function(){
            $("".sctrigger"").click(function(){
                $("".scdrawer"").toggle(""slow"");
                $(this).toggleClass(""active"");
                return false;
             });
            $(""#scMain"").scrollable({
                  vertical: true,
                 keyboard: 'static',
  }).navigator(""#scNavi"");
</code></pre>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>I'd like to not interupt playback open when closing the slideout panel.</p>

<p>Additional functionality, it would be nice however to call on the player and display the track name&amp;artist and a <em>stop</em> button within the <em>'listen'</em> tab that remains on the page when closed</p>

<h2>Potential solutions</h2>

<p>If the player is being destroyed ,is there a jquery method that could hide the player and not remove it entirely?</p>

<p>I have a feeling one solution would be to embed the player code within the page and use the soundcloud api to call on functions using my own icons etc, but this is a lot of build time especially considering my unfamiliarity and minimal experience..when I'm quite satisfied with the html5 widget.</p>

<p>Regarding the additional functionality; can one use any java based calls on the widget to get track info?</p>

<p>This is my first post so apologies if I'm not following standards &amp; a huge thanks ahead to the community out there on SO. Love this site.</p>
","9021","","<p>I can't recreate the error (Chrome 19, Firefox 13 on Ubuntu): playback continues fine even with rapid clicks on the 'Listen' tab.</p>

<p>jQuery.hide indeed does just hide whatever container element you specify and doesn't touch any of the child nodes, so they're definitely not being destroyed.</p>

<p>Is it pausing permanently, or does it just cause a momentary break in playback? If the latter, perhaps part of the issue might be the extra processing the browser has to do to perform the hiding animation is blocking the audio playback? This would be a bit surprising since I've never seen javascript/rendering affect media playback before. You could test this by removing the animation from the hide to see if that changes anything.</p>

<p>In terms of grabbing the track info, or controlling the playback via your own calls, you can use the <a href=""http://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/html5-widget#"" rel=""nofollow"">widget API</a>. To get track information (that is, the data as described in the <a href=""http://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/api/reference#tracks"" rel=""nofollow"">API docs</a>, like title, artwork url, user name, etc), you can use <code>SC.Widget(...).getCurrentSound()</code></p>

"<p>Trying to prepare good build environment for my js library. According to reviews on the web <a href=""https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS"" rel=""nofollow"">UglifyJS</a> seems to be one of the best compressing modules out there, working under NodeJS. So here is best recommended way of minifying the code:</p>

var final_code = pro.gen_code(ast); // compressed code here

<p>As seen here, <code>pro.ast_mangle(ast)</code> should mangle variable names, but it doesn't. All I get out of this pipe is javascript code, with no spaces.

<p>From the README:</p>

<pre><code>""jsdocs_notation_map"": [{
  ""regex"": ""tbl_?[Rr]ow"", // any arbitrary regex to test against the var name
  ""type"": ""TableRow""      // you can add your own types
}]
</code></pre>

<p>I want to catch variables that start with the <code>$</code> character</p>

<p><em>example:</em></p>

<pre><code>""jsdocs_notation_map"": [{
  ""regex"": ""^[$].+"",      // any word that starts with $
  ""type"": ""HTMLElement""   // That is its type
}]
</code></pre>

<p>So that the <code>$header</code> will be caught from the above regex.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the above does not work. The plugin won't recognize my <code>$header</code> variable 
as an ""HTMLElement"".</p>

<p>I have tried the following regex strings:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>$</code> - It matches everything, even varnames with no <code>$</code> inside them.</li>
<li><code>\\$</code> </li>
<li><code>\\\\$</code> </li>
<li><code>$$</code></li>
<li><code>\\$$</code></li>
<li><code>\\\\$$</code></li>
<li><code>[$]</code></li>
<li><code>[\\$]</code></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Sidenote: The editor won't let me insert odd numbers of <code>\</code>.</em></p>

<p>All of them match nothing, except for the first that matches everything.</p>

<p>This is not a RegEx question. The RegExs that should work, <em>(ex: <code>^[$].+</code>)</em> simply do not work because of the $ character. I think it has to do with the plugin settings mechanism and how the $ is used by the python parsing mechanism.</p>

<p><em>Sidenote: The <code>""^[.].+""</code> RegEx works as expected.</em></p>

<p>Any help is most welcome</p>

<p>PS: If anyone can be of help, i would like the ""^"" in the start of the regex string. I don't think that it won't work out of the box, but if not, please share the knowledge on that as well.</p>
","9021","","<p>Oh hey... so what the plugin does is strip any leading <code>$</code> or <code>_</code> from the variable/function name and then apply the regex. This was added so that <code>_foo</code> <code>$foo</code> and <code>foo</code> could all be recognised with the same regex, since at the time, I didn't think about those characters having special meaning. Looks like it's actually a complete misfeature in the end. Looks like you've spent a bit of time hacking on it, sorry 'bout that.</p>

<p>I've <a href=""https://github.com/spadgos/sublime-jsdocs/issues/66"" rel=""nofollow"">added it to the issue tracker</a> now. In the future, that would be a good way to get my attention, too :)</p>

"<p>Is there a way to use email (i.e., the SoundCloud user's registered email) to upload an audio file?  FriendFeed uses this method, which bypasses the need to integrate their APIs and solves the problem of queuing if the mobile device is not on the network when the upload request is made.  They use the subject line for title and the message content for description.  It makes it easy for any app that can email a sound to load into FriendFeed.</p>

"<p>I am trying to implement my version of the ""Instance Store"" in Backbone.js as described by Soundcloud in their recent blog post:</p>

<p><a href=""http://backstage.soundcloud.com/2012/06/building-the-next-soundcloud/"">http://backstage.soundcloud.com/2012/06/building-the-next-soundcloud/</a></p>

<p>Relevant Excerpt:</p>

<p>To solve this, we use a construct we call the instance store. This store is an object which is implicitly accessed and modified each time a constructor for a model is called. When a model is constructed for the first time, it injects itself into the store, using its id as a unique key. If the same model constructor is called with the same id, then the original instance is returned.</p>

<pre><code>var s1 = new Sound({id: 123}),
    s2 = new Sound({id: 123});

s1 === s2; // true, these are the exact same object.
</code></pre>

<p>This works because of a surprisingly little-known feature of Javascript. If a constructor returns an object, then that is the value assigned. Therefore, if we return a reference to the instance created earlier, we get the desired behaviour. Behind the scenes, the constructor is basically doing this:</p>

<pre><code>var store = {};

function Sound(attributes) {
    var id = attributes.id;

    // check if this model has already been created
    if (store[id]) {
        // if yes, return that
        return store[id];
    }
    // otherwise, store this instance
    store[id] = this;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I implemented my version of this by overriding the Backbone.Model class to create my own constructor.</p>

<pre><code>var MyModel = Backbone.Model.extend({
    constructor: function (attributes, options) {
        var id = attributes ? attributes.id : undefined;

        if (this.store[id]) {
            return this.store[id];
        }

        Backbone.Model.prototype.constructor.apply(this, arguments);

        if (id) {
            this.store[id] = this;
        }
    }
});

var MyOtherModel = MyModel.extend({
    store: {},

    //other model stuff
});
</code></pre>

<p>This was working just fine, but something must have changed and now it's stopped working, and I'm unsure why. Newly created instances are stored in the store object with no issue - each class that extends the MyModel class has its own empty store to avoid collisions of instances of a different type with the same id. The correct instance is also retrieved with no issue when the constructor is called with an existing id, however when they are returned from the constructor the return value is ignored. My understanding from the spec is that constructors can return an object - but not a primitive - and the returned object will be assigned to the lefthand side of the assignment statement when the constructor is called with the new operator. This isn't happening, even though the constructor returns an object, the empty object created by the new operator is used.</p>

<p>Some debugging info. Not sure how helpful this info will be. This is ""this"" in the MyModel constructor for an object being instantiated for the first time.</p>

<pre><code>child
    _callbacks: Object
    _escapedAttributes: Object
    _previousAttributes: Object
    _setting: false
    attributes: Object
        id: ""4fd6140032a6e522f10009ac""
        manufacturer_id: ""4f4135ae32a6e52a53000001""
        name: ""Tide""
        uniqueName: ""tide""
    __proto__: Object
    cid: ""c50""
    collection: child
    id: ""4fd6140032a6e522f10009ac""
    __proto__: ctor
        constructor: function (){ parent.apply(this, arguments); }
        defaults: Object
        store: Object
        url: function () {
        urlRoot: function () {
        __proto__: ctor
</code></pre>

<p>And this is ""this"" in the MyModel constructor when it's an object being returned from the instance store:</p>

<pre><code>child
    _callbacks: Object
    _escapedAttributes: Object
    _previousAttributes: Object
    _setting: false

        change: function (options) {

        manufacturer_id: 0

        on: function (events, callback, context) {
        parse: function (resp, xhr) {
        previous: function (attr) {
        previousAttributes: function () {
        save: function (key, value, options) {
        set: function (key, value, options) {

        url: function () {
        urlRoot: function () {
        __proto__: Object
        cid: ""c141""
     __proto__: ctor
        constructor: function (){ parent.apply(this, arguments); }
        defaults: Object
        store: Object
        url: function () {
        urlRoot: function () {
        __proto__: ctor
</code></pre>

<p>What I note is that the attributes object in the second one has all the methods of a backbone object included in there, which they shouldn't be. It also has no id, again I'm not sure why. Hopefully this provides some insight. Thanks.</p>
","9021","","<p>@wizard's approach seems pretty nice and clean. +1 to that.</p>

<p>The way it's implemented in SoundCloud is by overriding the <code>Backbone.Model.extend</code> method to create a class with our modified constructor and the store in a closure. The store was originally created in a closure to keep the class's interface clean, but after a while it was found to be useful for debugging to have a reference to each class's store, so it was also attached there.</p>

<p>We do have a reference count so that memory usage doesn't explode, and also give classes the ability to define a custom function which gives the unique value to identify it. Most of the time <code>id</code> is sufficient, but there are some corner cases where it doesn't quite work out.</p>

  <p>I'd welcome someone to come up with an in model solution keeping the ""store"" in the model instances's prototype</p>

","9021","","<p>If you are getting a 401 response, then you should include your <code>client_id</code> in the request. It might also be that it's a private sound, in which case, you'd also have to include the oauth credentials.</p>

<p>The actual success response is a redirect, since the stream files are accessible from a different server, but only with special time-limited access tokens (included in the redirect response). Basically, just follow the redirect and you'll have your stream.</p>

","9021","","<p>I'd say that it's actually a rather strange way to do it. Javascript provides function level scope, and you can use that to your advantage by using an immediately-invoked-function-expression (IIFE):</p>

<pre><code>myObject = {
    count: (function () {  // this function is invoked immediately
        var staticCounter = 0;
        return function () { // this is the actual 'count' function
            return ++staticCounter;
        };
    }())
};

myObject.count(); // 1
myObject.count(); // 2
</code></pre>

<p>One reason that this could be considered a better approach is that it completely hides the static variable. If you were to do <code>myObject.count.staticCounter</code>, some other code <em>might</em> be reading or writing to that variable. Obviously you wouldn't want that to happen, but if you do this, you are completely guaranteed of that variable's scope, which leads to easier debugging and refactoring in the future.</p>

<p>I had a reply on a Microsoft forum that seems to imply that SoundCloud might not be possible to stream to Windows 8 Metro devices without consuming the whole stream before playback starts - which is quite worrying and would seem to imply that to make authentication possible, it would have to be done entirely in the url querystring insterad of using the header:</p>

<p><em>(The following reply is the answer to the following question: 'I am able to access an audio stream by http using the MediaElement, however I need to access it via https in which I need to add the oAuth info to the header of the initial request.
How is this done when using a MediaElement, and if it cannot be done, what is the workaround for consuming an audio feed in Metro 8 that requires header authentication to stream?')</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Direct access to the underlying network stream is not currently permitted by the     MediaElement. Because of this there is currently no way to modify the header of the HTTP request to include any additional authentication information. That said, you do have control over the URL. You could theoretically setup an HTTP proxy service that translated the HTTP GET request parameters into the necessary oAuth credentials. Keep in mind that this is just a theoretical workaround. You may find different behavior in practice. Another theoretical workaround would be to handle the oAuth yourself via a raw stream socket and pass the retuned media data to the MediaElement via ""Set Source"" and a ""Random Access Stream"". Please keep in mind that this method has major limitations. in order to use a ""Random Access Stream"" with the ME you need to make sure all of the data is available before passing it to the ME.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The proxy service is not scalable for an application that is merely distributed for free as every stream would need to come via the proxy. And the raw stream socket, although getting around this, would mean that playback could not start until the whole file had downloaded - and this goes against all current UX (User Experience) guidelines.</p>

<p>In Chrome 21, feeding <code>[,]</code> to the console outputs</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[undefined x 1]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and feeding <code>[undefined]</code> outputs</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[undefined]</p>

<p>What is the difference between <code>[undefined]</code> and <code>[undefined x 1]</code>?</p>

<p>What is the notation <code>[undefined x 1]</code>?</p>
","9021","","<p>It looks like it's just a shorthand way to display the repeated 'undefined' values. eg:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; [,,,]
  [ undefined x 3 ]
</code></pre>

<p>But <code>[]</code> is not the same as <code>[undefined]</code> at all. I'd double check that if I were you.</p>

"<p>Now, everyone knows the cute little trick where you punch this Javascript code into your browser's URL bar:</p>

<pre><code>document.body.contentEditable = 'true'; document.designMode = 'on'; void 0
</code></pre>

<p>And El Presto! You can start freely editing a website just how you want it.</p>

<p>The only problem is - you can't save it!</p>

<p>After doing some quick research, I found that most likely, the best way to save this was by the method <a href=""http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090909082655AAHP56T"" rel=""nofollow"">suggested here</a>, which consists of somehow turning the page into a giant form and posting it to a MySQL database.</p>

<p>Sure, while doing this is great, it's going to end up saving my whole page - and not just the section or container that I want to edit - and that's a major problem because us developers need to preserve lines of code such as...</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php include('header.php'); ?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>...that aren't outputted in the HTML. In other words: it's going to save my page as it appears in outputted HTML, overwriting what is in my original PHP file.</p>

<p>What I'm asking how to do, is how would I go about saving a website edited like this, but just to save or update one or two editable containers on the website (not the whole thing so my PHP code doesn't get overwritten)?</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;This Won't get updated when the page is ""saved""&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=""update-this-contianer""&gt;
   This area will be passed on to the MySql database, and then updated into the same section of the original file.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- End Area To Update --&gt;
</code></pre>
","9021","","<p>Instead of setting <code>contentEditable</code> on the entire body, just put it on the element you want to edit. Then, send the contents of that element to the server. When you want to get the data back again, you just include that section in the appropriate place.</p>

"<p>I'm using the <a href=""http://www.schillmania.com/projects/soundmanager2/doc/"" rel=""nofollow"">SoundManager2 JavaScript SDK</a> on a site that streams synchronized audio from <a href=""http://soundcloud.com"" rel=""nofollow"">SoundCloud</a> to multiple clients simultaneously. When a new user loads the page, the audio is loaded, and a position parameter is set to specify where playback should begin.</p>

<p>The problem arises when the track is really long (say 60 minutes), and the current track position is substantially far into the track (e.g. 30 minutes). When this is the case, it takes a really long time before playback begins because the track has to download/buffer up to the current position. Is there a way to avoid downloading the 30 minutes of audio that I don't need?</p>
","9021","","<p>Sadly, no. We are looking into some alternatives for the current progressive download system, and hopefully could have something publicly available in a few months.</p>

"<p>In a backbone-enabled app, I have seen code that continues to use <code>&lt;a href=""#foo""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</code>, while the anchor click is handled by a backbone event handler. </p>

<p>Alternatively, the navigation to #foo can be handled by:</p>

<pre><code>Router.history.navigate(""foo"");
</code></pre>

<p>I believe the latter is the superior approach because it allows easy migration to and from HTML5's pushState functionality. And if we do use pushState, Backbone would be able to gracefully degrade to #foo for browsers that do not support pushState.</p>

<p>As I am still new to Backbone, can someone more experienced and knowledgable confirm that this is the case?</p>
","9021","","<p>You should write your links as their ""proper"" addresses, that is, not with the hash which is just a hack to get around some deficiencies of a particular browser. To then make it all work, attach a click handler to catch clicks on these items and pass the urls to Backbone.history, which can then use pushState or convert to a hashbang'd url if needed. For example:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).on('click', 'a[href^=""/""]', function (event) {
    // here, ensure that it was a left-mouse-button click. middle click should be
    // allowed to pass through
    event.preventDefault();
    Backbone.history.navigate(this.href);

<p>It seems to me like you'd need to know this api code to embed the track, and so you'd have to look this up each time.  </p>
","9021","","<p>The 'api code' is just <code>tracks/</code> followed by the track id (or <code>groups/</code> with a group id, etc), not too different from YouTube, it's just not as easily accessible as YouTube's, since the id isn't in the URL. You can get the id from looking at the share code on a track, but even easier is to use the <a href=""http://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/api/reference#oembed"" rel=""nofollow"">oembed service</a> to get the full embedding HTML needed (it also calculates the proper height of the iframe to include), and it only requires the 'permalink' url which you see on a track page.</p>

"<p>I'm working on a <code>Backbone.View</code> which should render a collection as a scrollable list.</p>

<p>Part of the initial rendering, I need access to some layout properties (e.g. <code>clientWidth</code>) which are only available after the view has been rendered.</p>

<p>My problem is, <em>how do I know when a view has been added to the DOM?</em></p>

<p>Using a <code>Backbone.View</code> there are typically 2 ways to attach a view to the DOM:</p>

<li><p>create the view > render it > attach it:</p>

<pre><code>view = new MyList().render()
$('#dummy').append(view.$el)

<li><p>create the view and render it in-place:</p>

<pre><code>new MyList({el: '#dummy'}).render()
</code></pre></li>

<p><em>Note: I know (1) and (2) are not completely equivalent, that's not the point.</em></p>

<hr>

","9021","","<p>Some users allow for their tracks to be downloaded, others don't. On one of the downloadable tracks, the track information will have a <code>download_url</code>, and you can download and process that however you like. As for accessing the stream during recording, at that point in time, the file doesn't exist on SoundCloud yet (it's only uploaded once the recording is complete). You could write your own Flash recorder or use the Web Audio API to get audio information during recording.</p>

"<p>I'm attempting to use some 3rd party libraries in my iOS app, as recommended by the SoundCloud API. I followed their <a href=""http://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/api/ios-quickstart"" rel=""nofollow"">tutorial</a>, running <code>git submodule add</code> on each of the required dependencies.</p>

<p>However, when compiling, I had to make some tiny tweaks to the dependency projects in order to get them to link correctly - purely in the project settings.</p>

<p>I have never used submodules before, but from what I've heard, the parent repo tracks a particular commit of the submodule, right? If I want to include the little tweaks to the project files of the 3rd party libraries, so that a team member can pull it from origin, does that mean I will have to fork each of the dependencies first and commit each of the little project settings, just so that they can be included in the main repo? Or can I make ""local"" changes to the 3rd party libraries, and then push the main repo to origin?</p>

<p>This is quite frustrating, since I'm not actually <em>changing</em> the 3rd party libraries per se, it's purely a setting I've had to change so that they work correctly with my specific project. Is there a way I can include tweaks in the main repo without forking each library in their entirety?!</p>

<p>Users will have to go to the popup screen. This is quite common for logging into third party services (think about how it works for Facebook Connect, or even for logging into Stack Overflow).

<p>This depends on what you mean by ""those tracks"": if you want all their tracks, then you can just use the API to fetch <a href=""http://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/api/reference#users"" rel=""nofollow"">all tracks by a given user</a> (<code>/users/:user_id/tracks</code>). If it's just the tracks they've uploaded using your app, you have a couple of different options depending on what you want to do.</p>

<p>You can get <a href=""http://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/api/reference#apps"" rel=""nofollow"">all public tracks uploaded with your application</a> (<code>/apps/:app_id/tracks</code>), but that would include tracks by everyone, and only public tracks. You could get all tracks by the current user (which would include private tracks) and then filter them inside your application by finding ones created with your app. This information is stored in the <code>""created_with""</code> property. eg:</p>

<pre><code>     ""created_with"": {
        ""id"": 124,
        ""name"": ""SoundCloud iPhone"",
        ""uri"": ""http://api.soundcloud.com/apps/124"",
        ""permalink_url"": ""http://soundcloud.com/apps/iphone""

"<p>I'm currently implementing an Oauth consumer service which is going to use Soundcloud as an Oauth service provider as well. But I'm having the following issue with it: Taking Facebook or Twitter example, you go there, you sign in, you fill up the permission form, and you are redirected back to your app. If you go there a second time, and given you are already sign in, you basically skip all steps and are redirected back instantly. That means, Facebook recognized that you already gave permission to that 3rd party service, so it doesn't ask your permission constantly. </p>

<p>And that's what's happening when I use Soundcloud. Basically everytime I redirected the user to the Soundcloud Oauth connect endpoint, the permission form always shows up, even though I already gave permission to that 3rd party service previously. I'm forced to press ""connect"" every single time, which is a drag from the user perspective (how many times can you give permission to the same entity). My question is: is there a parameter I can use to make soundcloud recognize/validate the previous permission from the user account to that specific 3rd party service? Or is this Soundcloud Oauth design implementation and we have to live with it? </p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>Maybe this wasn't clear, but each time I press ""connect"" in soundcloud, a new access token is being generated and delivered. Since my app uses this access token to identify its users, it doesn't work very well for me that the access token is getting updated everytime I want to log in, making me effectively ""sign up"" everytime. To sum it up, I want to get the previously attributed token to my account, so I can look up in my database, identify it and log him in. </p>

<p>I'm also looking for a solution which doesn't involve storing state in the client that might get cleaned up. </p>
","9021","","<p>What you can do is store the user's oauth token in local storage and reuse it in future sessions. That's what happens on soundcloud.com.</p>

<p><em>A longer explanation:</em></p>

<p>When you use the Connect flow, the user is authenticated by SoundCloud (either by using username/password, Facebook Connect, or an already-existing session on soundcloud.com), and then when it is successful, your app is given an oauth token for that user. This is passed to the callback page which is registered for your app.</p>

<p>That token is the only piece of information needed to have the user be ""logged in"". Unless the token expires (by time, or by the user manually revoking it), then you can reuse that in future sessions.</p>

<p>I think I'm a bit confused about your application's design: where and how is the oauth token being used? I think that instead of using the token as an identifier, perhaps the user's permalink might be better? If you have the oauth token, you can find out the permalink by querying <code>api.soundcloud.com/me</code>.</p>

","9021","","<p>The waveforms on soundcloud.com are drawn with canvas -- whereas in your sample image, it appears as though it's a larger image which is scaled down to the desired size. When you do this scaling in the browser, it will anti-alias the 'half' pixels. When drawing to the canvas, we draw exactly the pixels needed at the exact resolution needed. This means there's no image scaling and no blurriness.</p>

"<p><strong>Soundcloud</strong> is incredible. Compared to all other music-oriented sites, as a computer science major and a die-hard music fan, I can assuredly say Soundcloud is a beautiful creation, in terms of both purpose and design. Onto my (rudimentary and somewhat secondary) idea:</p>

<p>I feel it would be beneficial for Soundcloud to have a feature which allows for reverse playback - not in terms of playing song files themselves in reverse, but in reverse chronological order. Including this option would simply be a matter of a toggleable (probably not a real word) <code>i--</code> vs. <code>i++</code> and an additional conditional. </p>

<p>Doing so would allow for users to listen through their favorites in order of oldest to newest, to understand the development of artists over time, etc. While this isn't necessarily IMPORTANT, I think it extremely utilitarian, especially when programs like iTunes offer the option to sort by date added/modified.</p>

<p>true is on.
Share is public.
Stream is accepted.</p>

<p>But you can't actually access the stream in our player as the stream returns a 401 error instead.</p>

<p>Can anyone offer any insight into why or what may be happening here so I can pass that info back to my developer?</p>

","9021","","<p>The callback file is used to send the authentication token back to your application.

"<p>I've seen a lot of code written like this;</p>

<pre><code>conditional_value = if thing_is_true
                      true_value

                    end
</code></pre>

<p>I feel conflicted about this. On one hand it's nice to use the return value of the conditional (or any other syntactic chunk like switches, begin/ends, loops, or even function definitions) to reduce redundancy and make it clear what the code is doing. On the other hand, the indentation is often jarring and confusing. </p>

<p>As a second possibility, if one decides to have all lines indented to the level of the beginning of the first line, that destroys the visual cue of the whole structure.</p>

<pre><code>conditional_value = if thing_is_true
  true_value
else
  other_value
end
</code></pre>

<p>Here's a third alternative (at least in Ruby) relying on line breaks;</p>

<pre><code>conditional_value =
  if thing_is_true
    true_value
  else
    other_value
  end
</code></pre>

<p>A fourth alternative is to bite the bullet and put the assignment statement in every branch.</p>

<pre><code>if thing_is_true
  conditional_value = true_value
else
  conditional_value = other_value
end
</code></pre>

<p>I'm wary of this becoming an 'opinions' question, but I think there are <em>facts</em> I don't know;</p>

<ul>
<li>How often are these styles seen in professional code?</li>
<li>How easy is it for people to read?</li>
<li>Do any of these styles commonly cause bugs?</li>
<li>In what ways do these styles maintain or break the integrity of the visual presentation of the code?</li>
</ul>
","9021","","<p>I think it definitely makes it clearer to the reader what the intention of the code is when it starts with the assignment. That is, if I'm debugging that code and I already know that the variable assigned from the conditional is behaving itself (ie: not the source of the bug), then I can completely skip over that entire block, without spending brain cycles figuring out if there's side effects inside there.</p>

<p>In languages without a terse <code>if else</code> format, it can definitely become cumbersome, however in languages which have the ternary operator (<code>? :</code>) and a sensible order of operations (read: not PHP), I quite like this style also for arbitrarily nested conditionals:</p>

<pre><code>var x = someCondition ? a

Though the pixels on the canvas are out of date, if I were able to keep a reference to the path, then updating would be as simple as re-stroking the previously constructed path.</p>

<p><strong>My question is: how on earth do you get a Path object?</strong></p>

<p>The fill and stroke methods appear to <a href=""http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/2dcontext/html5_canvas/#drawing-paths-to-the-canvas"">accept a path object</a>, and the spec defines the <a href=""http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/2dcontext/html5_canvas/#path-objects"">methods for Path</a>, but I can't seem to find the actual <code>Path</code> class anywhere...</p>

<p>So, just to recap:</p>

<p>I have something like this:</p>

<pre><code>function update() {
  context.beginPath();
  // lots of lines added to the default path...
  context.moveTo(x1, y1); context.lineTo(somewhere, else);
  context.moveTo(x2, y2); context.lineTo(somewhere, else);

  context.stroke();
}
</code></pre>

<p>What I'd like is something like this:</p>

<pre><code>function update() {
  if (!this.path) {
    this.path = new Path(); // &lt;-- here's the magic
    this.path.moveTo(x1, y2); this.path.lineTo(somewhere, else); // etc
  }
  this.path.stroke();
}
</code></pre>
","9021","","<p>Turns out, it's just that no browser supports it yet, according to this blog (dated 24th January 2013) <a href=""http://www.rgraph.net/blog/2013/january/html5-canvas-path-objects.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rgraph.net/blog/2013/january/html5-canvas-path-objects.html</a></p>

"<p>I am trying to adjust the soundcloud embed widget but am having some difficulty. I would like to do two things:</p>

<p>1) Override the CSS for the div.sc-truncate ( overflow: hidden; white-space: nowrap ) which contains the text ""Wanderlust Basement Tapes"" but will currently not display the entire text due to the aforementioned text. I have added my own style to the site stylesheet with !important but they seem to have no effect which I think has to do with the widget being an iframe.</p>

<p>2) Force the widget layout proportions to show full song list by default. Normally this requires scrolling to the bottom of the list. Ex:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/zpBUT.png"" alt=""Widget 1""></p>

<p>vs</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/CC2eM.png"" alt=""Widget 2""></p>

<p>I'm guessing that the proportions change after scrolling via some javascript but all the javascript being used by the widget is minified as far as I can tell and is thus difficult to analyze and/or modify. For this reason I am hoping that a developer of the widget will be able to recommend a possible method.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","9021","","<p>It's not possible to modify the styles of any page in an iframe from the containing document (including the SoundCloud widget).</p>

<p>Having it spread over two lines does look pretty fine in this case, but obviously title lengths of all sizes also need to be considered. I will pass on the request to investigate removing the truncation.</p>

"<p>I'm looking for a third party embedded sound player to embed WMA files onto a page.</p>

<p>I'm looking for the type of player that is bold, has play and pause.</p>

<p>Similar to what is on offer on soundcloud.</p>

<p>I've had a search but they all seem to be mp3 specific, has anyone used one for wma files that you can recommend.</p>

<p>Many thanks!</p>
","9021","","<p>You can upload WMA files to SoundCloud. </p>

"<p>I am trying to use the hosted SoundCloud JS SDK in a node-webkit desktop app.</p>

<p>It seems like a lot of links in the API use //... instead of http://... and node-webkit gets confused because of this. It tries to find the resource at file://... I want to be able to stream music into a custom player using the SDK's streaming features.</p>

<p>How can I do one of these:</p>

<ol>
<li>Trick node-webkit into looking at http:// instead of file://</li>
<li>Use JavaScript to stream music without the SDK into my own player with JavaScript</li>
</ol>

<p>Should I just download and edit the SDK and include it in the app?</p>

<p>I would really love to use the SDK because it makes my life simpler.</p>
","9021","","<p>Hmm, yeah I guess this was never thought of at the time. Personally, I'd go with 'forking' and specifying the urls (I'd also choose 'https').</p>

"<p>As of today, when I try to embed a sound with SoundCloud oEmbed I get the following Javascript error: </p>

<pre><code>Cross-Origin Request Blocked

<p>Is this something I can fix on my server side or is this an issue which came up on SoundCloud's side?</p>
","9021","","<p>Indeed it was a bad routing change. Apologies for the interruption! Fix is now live.</p>

"<p>I'm very happy to know Sound Cloud provided API to upload music. Also they made a <a href=""https://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/api/guide#uploading-files"" rel=""nofollow"">pretty good doc</a> on how to do that. But as they right mentioned - there is a problem</p>

<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Javascript SDK hasn't access to file system. So</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> <em>How to download music to Sound Cloud from JS stream?</em></p>
","9021","","<p>You can get access to files by using a form with <code>&lt;input type=""file""&gt;</code> or the drag-and-drop api.</p>
