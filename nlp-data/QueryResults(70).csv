QUESTION,USERID,USERNAME,ANSWER
"<p>How can I replace spaces in URL with a underline(_)?</p>

<pre><code>$query = mysql_query(""SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$_GET[user]'"");
</code></pre>

<p>But if a user has a space in her/his username I wanna replace the space with an underline.
So the URL for profile.php?user=John Johnson would be profile.php?user=John_Johnson.</p>

<p>How can I do this?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","70393","","<p>Biff,</p>

<p>Try this:</p>

<pre><code>$user = urldecode($_GET['user']);
</code></pre>

<p><code>$user</code> now contains 'John Smith' instead of 'John%20Smith', which I assume is why the query was failing.</p>

<pre><code>$user = mysql_escape_string($user);
$query = mysql_query(""SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = $user"");
</code></pre>

<p>Your problem seems to be with URL Encoded characters preventing a match. Hope that helps.</p>

"<p>There are similar questions at SO, but none that seem to address this.</p>

<p>Below is a very simplified variant of my situation. Drupal/PHP site -- I have a form w/ submit button that I am using jquery.form plugin to ajax-ly submit. It works fine if I use the submit (#submit) button. </p>

"<p>I'm not exactly sure how to word this but  I'll try.  </p>

<p>Suppose you have some settings in some piece of your program where your 80% sure you won't ever have to modify again.  How do you know where to draw the line on changeable code?  You know that taking the settings all the way to a user defined XML file is overkill.  However, you also know that there is a slight 20% chance that these settings may need to be changed later on so coding it at the place where the rubber meets the road isn't optimal either.  </p>

<p>I guess what I'm trying to ask is, how far up the abstraction tree should you allow your program to be easily changeable?  </p>

<p>One of many examples is writing the HTML code for a website manually vs having the program automatically generating it.  Writing the HTML code directly doesn't take too much time.  Writing the a program to automatically generate the HTML code takes much longer.  </p>
","70393","karim79","<p>I'll give this a shot, my philosophy is as follows:</p>

<p>1 - Keep a config file &amp; parser class/function that are extremely dumbed down and simple as possible to give you the peace of mind that whenever you need something from it, you can get it without having to instantiate a ridiculously overbloated XML crunching configuration file parser. My config file looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>DBHostname -&gt; XX.XX.XXX.XX
DBUsername -&gt; foomonger
DBName -&gt; fooDb
DBPassword -&gt; xxxxx
ImageUploadsDir -&gt; /uploads/images/
...
</code></pre>

<p>I extract what I need from it using either a static helper method (small apps) or a singleton instance (large MVC driven apps) generated by my idiot friend ConfigHelper, who is so dumb, he doesn't know how to generate overhead.</p>

<p>I have this dilemma several times in my average working day: should I put this in config.txt or should I make it a class constant? My answer is I just don't know - until much later on. If it turns out that it needed to be put into the config file, nothing beats a decent IDE with a stable 'Find &amp; Replace In Projects' implementation for changing references.</p>

<p>3 - Config files take the nightmare out of application deployment when development involves a testing server followed by deployment to production - there is no real practical alternative. Different database instances on different machines have different IPs in the world I understand.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>This is so true. While we as developers enjoy building machines, we tend to waste a lot of time building machines to build the machine we initially intended to build. While this can be extremely gratifying, from experience I can venture to say that in <em>most</em> situations the more machines you have, the more systems you have to support, the more points of failure, the more hand smacks you get from the business owners - and that is not fun. Furthermore, you will tend to run into situations where the intermediate HTML generator thingie cannot produce the desired output. So what do you do, waste time fixing the bug in the generator thingie, waste time devising a voodoo workaround, or simply hand-write the HTML? It really depends on the particular circumstance, but I prefer the latter.</p>

"<p>The IT department I work in as a programmer revolves around a 30+ year old code base (Fortran and C). The code is in a poor condition partially as a result of 30+ years of ad-hoc poorly thought out changes but I also suspect a lot of it has to do with the capabilities of the programmers who made the changes (and who incidentally are still around).</p>

<p>The business that depends on the software operates 363 days a year and 20 hours a day. Unfortunately there are numerous outages. This is the first place I have worked where there are developers on call to apply operational code fixes to production systems. When I was first, there was actually a copy of the source code and development tools on the production servers so that on the fly changes could be applied; thankfully that practice has now been stopped.</p>

<p>I have hinted a couple of times to management that the costs of the downtime, having developers on call, extra operational staff, unsatisifed customers etc. are costing the business a lot more in the medium, and possibly even short term, than it would to launch a whole hearted effort to re-write/refactor/replace the whole thing (the code base is about 300k lines).</p>

<p>Ideally they'd be some external consultancy that could come in and run the rule over the quality of the code and the costs involved to keep it running vs rewrite/refactor/replace it. The question I have is how should a business go about doing that kind of cost analysis on software AND be able to have confidence in that analysis? The first IT consultants down the street may claim to be able to do the analysis but how could management be made to feel comfortable with it over what they are being told by internal staff?</p>
","70393","karim79","<p>The code has been around for 30 years?</p>

<p>Development paradigms have shifted substantially in the last three decades in many ways, and most relevant to your predicament, I feel, is in terms of the amount of time (in man days) required to create something to input->process->output something.</p>

<p>300,000 lines of code 30 years ago, could probably fit into 100,000 lines or less today, and expending fewer man hours(?) This could seem optimistic/ridiculous to some, but on the other hand <em>is</em> achievable, depending on the type of application in question. You have given no indication as to the classification of system - is it a real-time manufacturing process control system of sorts with sensors and actuators tied to it? An airline booking system ? Does it post-process some backlog of data? In other words could it be rebuilt in something like Java and quickly with an agressive, smallish team? Have the requirements been documented, and if so do they need updating or redeveloping from scratch? Is human safety a factor?</p>

<p>Just a quick sanity check, I think whether or not you should rebuild depends on (any order means the same thing):</p>

<ol>
<li>Number of code dudes required.</li>
<li>Level of expertise of said dudes.</li>
<li>Which languages do not fit.</li>
<li>Which languages do fit.</li>
<li>How much it costs to use chosen language(s) them in terms of hardware and software.</li>
<li>How much does the business depend on this to stay alive.</li>
<li>Is it really too much downtime, or are you just nitpicking? (maybe they really don't care, but pretend to).</li>

"<p>I've had this problem for a while, and I've isolated it to being caused the mysql_connect or mysql_select_db function. For some reason, when I use jquery's .load(), the response text will have a line break at the top when displayed in the page (in a <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code>, for instance, but in any element). Looking at the response in Firebug, there is no line break. And if I just put plain text in the script that I'm calling, the line break doesn't show up. It has something to do with the connection to the database that the script I'm calling is making. The line break will even show up if I write it to console.log().

","70393","karim79","<p>For a quick &amp; dirty solution, you could store user credentials in an array, e.g:</p>

<pre><code>$creds = array( 
               array( 'username' =&gt; 'john123',
                      'password' =&gt; 'hello'),

                   //more sub arrays like above here
         );
</code></pre>

<p>You can then match the user's input, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>$username = $_POST['username'];
$password = $_POST['password'];

$match = false;
for($i=0;$i&lt;count($creds);$i++) {
    if(strcmp($username,$creds[$i]['username']) == 0) {
        if(strcmp($password,$creds[$i]['password']) == 0) {

        }
    }
}

if($match) echo 'Login successful: welcome ' . $creds[$i]['username'];
    else echo 'Invalid credentials';

<p>EDIT: On subsequent page call, you can check if the user is still logged in by reading the $_SESSION</p>

<pre><code>session_start();
if($_SESSION['authenticated'] === true) {
     echo 'User ' . $_SESSION['username'] . ' is logged in.';
}
</code></pre>

<p>To log out the user, you can execute this code:</p>

<pre><code>	$_SESSION = array();
	// If it's desired to kill the session, also delete the session cookie.
	// Note: This will destroy the session, and not just the session data!
	if (isset($_COOKIE[session_name()])) {
		setcookie(session_name(), '', time()-42000, '/');
	}
	// Finally, destroy the session.

"<p>A preamble:
I've been using PHP for over 8 year every now and then, but never used a framework, only wrote scripts and addons.
Mostly I used code generators like CodeCharge Studio or custom code for intranet apps.
Since I am ok with design patterns, <strong>Zend framework</strong> doesn't look too hard for me to learn.</p>

<p>Starting with ZF: I've a read the QuickStart manual and wonder what can advance me to being fast with basic Zend web app development. As I understand there are <strong>repetitious tasks</strong> that take a lot of time.</p>

<p>Questions:
For instance, for almost every site I develop there must be User Registration process and I don't want to reinvent the wheel and spend a week for Login/Profile forms. </p>

<p>1) Do you, Zend developers, use some kind of prototypes you've written to roll out a basic site quickly? </p>

<p>2) Or are there some site source codes to be built upon already available?</p>

<p>3) Is there some app generator or minor tool for pages with grids, records etc?</p>

<p>P.S. I stopped learning EJB over 6 years ago because I didn't have anyone to ask similar questions. TIA!</p>
","70393","karim79","<blockquote>
  <p>As I understand there are repetitious
  tasks that take a lot of time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is true, and as you stated, just about every website has a registration process and the like. While I agree that implementing such features over and over again can be repetitive, to some extent, each application will have its own unique set of requirements - meaning there will be at least a little customization work involved, even if you're reusing code from an older ZF-based project. I will now have a bash at answering your numbered questions</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do you, Zend developers, use some kind
  of prototypes you've written to roll
  out a basic site quickly?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not really. I would not choose the ZF for a 'basic' site, nor would I use any MVC framework. My current assumption is that a basic site consists of about 8 to 12 separate parts, with no really special functionality, and finite requirements. Remember that once we say 'framework', there is almost always a noticeable performance hit, in addition to whatever bugs and issues which might be inherent within that framework.
The 'prototypes' you speak of would be in the classes available within the Zend Framework, for example, <a href=""http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.auth.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Zend_Auth</a> for creating a fully featured authentication system in about 15 minutes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>2) Or are there some site source codes
  to be built upon already available?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Probably, though I have to say, my worst nightmare would be having to support an application built on some kind of framework that wraps another framework. Image how much fun debugging it would be. Imagine how much fun teaching someone to support it would be. You're already using a framework, let's not get greedy now.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>3) Is there some app generator or
  minor tool for pages with grids,
  records etc?</p>

"<p>The effect of issuing an inner join is the same as stating a cross join with the join condition in the WHERE-clause.

I've seen so many solutions that constantly ping whatever element they are wanting to monitor, but for any sort of resource heavy application (or for any case depending on the standards of the developer) that becomes bloated and too hackish to be a viable method. Which brings me to my question, ""What are the limitations of javascript's onchange event?"". Specifically, right now I'm trying to monitor the size of the window. Is there a way to utilize the .onchange event for things like this? How would you solve this?</p>

<p>Thanks! I'm very interested to hear what everyone has to say.</p>

<p>One logical approach, which may not be the correct MySQL approach, is to get the most recent record for each for each <code>user_id</code>, and then, if the result set is less than 25, begin adding a second record for each <code>user_id</code> until the 25 record limit is met (maybe a third, fourth, etc. record for each <code>user_id</code> would be needed).</p>

<p>Can this be accomplished with a MySQL query, or will I need to take a large result set and trim it down to 25 with code?</p>
","70393","karim79","<p>My opinion is to use application logic, as this is very much application layer logic you are trying to implement at the DB level, i.e. filtering down the results to make the search more useful to the end user.</p>

"<p>Recently I've faced such problem.
I'm working on the application, in which logging is very important.</p>

<p>By logs in that application I mean the messages, like </p>

<ul>
<li>User A(id=x) has created invoice(invoice # is XXX) (1)</li>
<li>User B(id=y) has purchased the book (2)</li>
<li>User A(id=x) has approved invoice XXX (3)</li>
</ul>

<p>(1) and (3) are messages of one particular request/command - so when I want to see the logs, I need to get all the information about this request log thread.</p>

<p>Because of the application is highly loaded and uses AJAX a lot, log message of different users/operations/requests can be mixed. </p>

<p>Temporary, I've fixed this problem like this:</p>

<p>I've created at the beginning of the request some unique <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UUID"" rel=""nofollow"">UUID</a> code, and prepend any log messages with this unique code. So, I can find all the messages of particular thread by simple grep UNIX command.</p>

<p>That solves the problem, but I'm not sure it is the best solution for the task. Looks more like reinventing the wheel.
What solutions would you reccomend for this problem?</p>
","70393","karim79","<p>Off the top of my head, a couple of suggestions (if you haven't already implemented them)</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Log each different type of event into a separate log file, e.g. BookPurchases.log, InvoiceApprovals.log. That said keep a raw output log of everything in case it's the sequence of events that matters as opposed to the classification.</p></li>
<li><p>Use a logging package if you don't already have one, examples are <a href=""http://www.indelible.org/php/Log/guide.html"" rel=""nofollow"">The Log Package</a>, or <a href=""http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.log.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Zend_Log</a> where you can have different logging priorities.</p></li>

"<p>I'm looking for a simple-to-learn php framework for an application that is being migrated from Access to PHP. The application has lots of forms (sometimes 50+ fields per page), and lots of the fields are inter-dependent (ie, you change one field, it updates some other fields or options).</p>

<p>Is there any good php framework for this? I would prefer it really simple since:</p>

<ul>
<li>The devs are not so experienced</li>
<li>The DB is being migrated from Access and was not designed with OOP in mind, it's basically a collection of tables divided by functionality, so I probably don't need any ORM (at least for now).</li>
</ul>

<p>The most important thing is really the ease of form design and fields correlation (ex: two list boxes where the values of the second depends of the selected value of the first) - I know most ajax libs have some support for this but I would like it out of the box.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>edit: As a clarification, the most important is not the ajax nifty stuff, although it is important. The important is a <strong>straightforward</strong> way to create db-based forms. The db is not designed with an ORM in mind, so I don't need fancy table associations on the ORM layer whith cascade deletes etc. If an ORM layer doesn't get in the way and simplifies the implementation so that's ok but i doubt this will ever be true.</p>

"<p>So recently I learned how to properly add a username and password to a database.
My database is usersys, and the table storing user information is called userdb. The table has two columns - username (primary), password.</p>

<p>The registration form works great, enters the users input into the database correctly and also checks to see whether the user's username is already in the database or not.</p>

<p>With that said, I am asking if anyone could help me create a login script. So far, this is what I have:</p>

<pre><code>$username = $_POST['username'];
$password = $_POST['password'];
$displayname = $_POST['username'];
$displayname = strtolower($displayname);
$displayname = ucfirst($displayname);           
echo ""Your username: "" . $displayname . ""&lt;br /&gt;"";

mysql_connect(""localhost"", ""root"", ""******"") or die(mysql_error());
echo ""Connected to MySQL&lt;br /&gt;"";

mysql_select_db(""usersys"") or die(mysql_error());
echo ""Connected to Database &lt;br /&gt;"";

$lcusername = strtolower($username);
$esclcusername = mysql_real_escape_string($lcusername);
$escpassword = mysql_real_escape_string($password);

$result = mysql_query(""SELECT * FROM userdb WHERE username='$esclcusername' AND     password='$escpassword'"") or die(mysql_error());
$row = mysql_fetch_array( $result );
$validateUser = $row['username'];
$validatePass = $row['password'];
</code></pre>

<p>The POST data is from the previous log in page. I want this script to check the table (userdb) and find the row for the username that the user entered from the previous form and verify that the password entered matches the username's password set in that row, in userdb table.</p>

<p>I also want some type of way to check whether or not if the username entered exists, to tell the user that the username entered does not exists if it can not be found in the table.</p>
","70393","karim79","<p>One way to do it (DISCLAIMER: not necessarily best-practice):</p>

<p>1) Those column names in the DB have different case, e.g. <strong>userId</strong> could be just <strong>userid</strong></p>

"<p>I have an HTML file with a couple of external JavaScript files.  Here's an example, somewhat simplified from the real HTML and JavaScript files:</p>

"<p>I'm going to make a small site which requires advanced search capabilities. Since reinventing the wheel isn't such a worthwhile activity, I've done a little googling and found there are some PHP based search frameworks, one of which is integrated into Zend framework.</p>

<p>What I would like to have in the framework:</p>

<ol>
<li>Both full-text and catalogue search capabilities</li>
<li>Display results sorted by relevance</li>
<li>Ability to filter results by category</li>
<li>Sorting results by various criteria</li>
<li>Fast search</li>
<li>Fast insertion not required</li>
</ol>

<p>Since the site will feature pretty much static content (some text and a product catalogue), I might go with some pre-generated index.</p>

<p>Are there any (free) frameworks that could meet the above requirements? Suggestions, tips and ideas are more than welcome. It'd be great if you could share your experiences implementing a search system.</p>
","70393","karim79","<p>I recently developed a suggestive fulltext search to use with my Zend Framework based web application - I couldn't find any ready-made solution that fit my requirements, so I went all out and developed a simple(fulltext) keyword search mechanism from scratch.

<p>What I have now is a system that matches items based on a 'text summary' that is generated at the time the item is saved (or updated) in the database. I have a table called kw_search_summary that contains the text summary of each item (script generated), its id and its category id. The 'summary' column is a mysql fulltext index, so I simply MATCH() the summary column AGAINST() a given expression, and display the results by relevancy. The code that builds this query looks a bit like this:</p>

<pre><code>    $select = $this-&gt;db-&gt;select()
                 -&gt;from(array('kwi' =&gt; 'kw_search_index'),
                        array('id','prodcatid','itemid','useradid','summary','relevance' =&gt; ""match(summary) against($safeExp in boolean mode)""))
                 -&gt;where(""match(summary) against($safeExp in boolean mode)"")

<p>Thanks for your help!</p>
","70393","karim79","<p>I've had too much coffee today, so I figure I will give this a go.</p>

<p>One possibility is the <strong>load</strong> function in <strong>scriptaculous.js</strong> does not correctly do the processing to include the libraries passed to it as parameters <strong>(scriptaculous.js?load=builder,effects)</strong>.</p>

<p>Try putting in an alert to see if the load function in scriptaculous.js is being entered into, if it is, then the process probably doesn't do what it's supposed to on FF2:</p>

<pre><code>load: function() {
    alert('In the load function!');
    ...rest of code here...
</code></pre>

<p>If it isn't, then (maybe) firefox 2 does not want to execute load.</p>

<p>The last part of load seems to do the work for including other libs:</p>

<pre><code>$A(document.getElementsByTagName(""script"")).findAll( function(s) {
      return (s.src &amp;&amp; s.src.match(/scriptaculous\.js(\?.*)?$/))
    }).each( function(s) {
      var path = s.src.replace(/scriptaculous\.js(\?.*)?$/,'');
      var includes = s.src.match(/\?.*load=([a-z,]*)/);
      (includes ? includes[1] : 'builder,effects,dragdrop,controls,slider,sound').split(',').each(
       function(include) { Scriptaculous.require(path+include+'.js') });
    });
</code></pre>

<p>From the above code, I can see that the <strong>includes</strong> variable should parse out the library names, see if that's being assigned anything, replace it with something like:</p>

<pre><code>var includes = s.src.match(/\?.*load=([a-z,]*)/);
alert(includes[0] + ' ' + includes[1]);
</code></pre>

<p>That should give you a better idea of what's going on. While this is an interesting little problem, I would definitely go with the solution you proposed:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""/javascripts/scriptaculous.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

"<p>I'm a junior developer and have been working since I graduated last summer so coming up to a year now. I have this issue that is starting to get to me. Every night I think back to what I did that day, feel bad that I didn't get as much done as I would have liked and then tick off in my head all the things I'll get done the following day. Come the end of the following day I end haven't gotten through half of what I wanted to.</p>

<p>This over optimism that I'm suffering from. Might it be just because I'm relatively new to the profession and aren't aware of how long things will actually take me. The work might be quick to think through in my head but all sorts of time sync's involved can bleed away the hours. If not that then perhaps it's the technology stack that I'm working on. SharePoint isn't the easiest thing to develop for and it's certainly something I came into not knowing a whole lot about.</p>

<p>If it's because I'm not yet skilled enough to predict how long things will take me, is this trait of over optimistic predictions universal to the profession? I'd appreciate any input from those experienced with working with younger developers and those that might have suffered from this themselves.</p>

"<p>How to detect that the Internet connection is offline in JavaScript?</p>
","70393","","<p>You can use <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Ajax/jQuery.ajax#options"" rel=""nofollow"">$.ajax()</a>'s <code>error</code> callback, which fires if the request fails. If <code>textStatus</code> equals the string ""timeout"" it probably means connection is broken:</p>

<pre><code>function (XMLHttpRequest, textStatus, errorThrown) {
  // typically only one of textStatus or errorThrown 
  // will have info
  this; // the options for this ajax request
}
</code></pre>

<p>From the <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Ajax/jQuery.ajax#options"" rel=""nofollow"">doc</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Error</strong>: A function to be called if the request
  fails. The function is passed three
  arguments: The XMLHttpRequest object,
  a string describing the type of error
  that occurred and an optional
  exception object, if one occurred.
  Possible values for the second
  argument (besides null) are ""timeout"",
  ""error"", ""notmodified"" and
  ""parsererror"". This is an Ajax Event</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So for example:</p>

<pre><code> $.ajax({
   type: ""GET"",
   url: ""keepalive.php"",

"<p>I'm not entirely sure how to post this question, but here goes...</p>

<p>I have a web app that has a list of sortable items.  I sort them ajax style using Sortable.  That works like a charm.  I can drag and drop the items till my heart is content.</p>

<p>At the same time, there is a button that allows for the creation of new items on my list.  This is also ajaxified and works for the most part.  The new item appears on my list anyway, and firebug shows that the code being rendered is exactly the same as the other list items.  Oh and it is contained in the correct list.  </p>

<p>The problem is that the new item is not draggable/sortable/whatever.  I can't do anything with it unless I refresh the page.  Any ideas why this is the case or how I can get around it?  I'd really like to solve this.</p>

<p>I tried to paste code in here, but couldn't quite make it work, so I went with pastie.  Anyway, here is the code for a page with 2 sortable items.  This is a fresh load and everything works as expected.

You need to send some parameters to the php script, and put the response into some element(s) on the page, once every x seconds. This should get you started:</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;script src=""/js/Prototype.js""&gt;
    //calls renderResponse on completion of the AJAX post to the specified URL
    function sendRequest(parameters,URLEndpoint){
    	var myAjax = new Ajax.Request
    				 (
    					 URLEndpoint,
    					 {
    						 method: 'post', 
    						 postBody: parameters, 
    						 onSuccess: renderResponse
    					 }
    				 );
    }

    //replace contents of 'character' div or whatever with output from PHP script
    function renderResponse(response){
       var el = $(characterTable); 
       elementId.innerHTML = resp.responseText;
    }

    //execute sendRequest every 2 seconds
    function periodicalUpdate() {
        new PeriodicalExecuter(sendRequest('monkeys=2&amp;carrots=7','http://mywebsite.com/game.php'), 2);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>There's a jQuery plugin function that does the same job as PeriodicUpdate. I haven't tried it but it looks compelling:</p>

"<p>I've go an absolute URL in my JavaScript that I have hard coded for window.location.</p>

<p>I don't want to have to change this every time I am testing my app. In PHP I would have handled this by testing the $_SERVER[""HTTP_HOST""] variable to find out what server I am on, and adjust accordingly. However, I'm not as familiar with Java and am wondering if it has a similar method? Or if maybe even JavaScript had a similar method?</p>

<p>The code is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>var url = ""http://172.17.1.107/store/results/index.jsp"";
window.location = url;
</code></pre>

<p>What I would like to do is:</p>

<pre><code>var server = [something that returns just 172.17.1.107 (with or without the http:// is fine)]
var url = ""http://"" + server + ""/store/results/index.jsp"";
window.location = url;

<p>In PHP I would have just done this:</p>

<pre><code>var server = &lt;?= $_SERVER[""HTTP_HOST""] ?&gt;
var url = ""http://"" + server + ""/store/results/index.php"";
window.location = url;
</code></pre>

<p>Any ideas? I suppose I'm operating under the assumption that you have to do an absolute URL to change the location of the current window in JavaScript. If there is another way to change the window location in JavaScript without an absolute URL, please feel free to offer that as well.</p>

"<h3>PHP as a Blunt Instrument</h3>

<p>I hear PHP getting bashed around a lot lately. In quite a few projects, I have seen insane php code bases - so bad you really wonder if the person was on hallucinogenic drugs when they wrote the code. Sometimes, I wonder what the code would have been like if the initial developers had a bit more guidance as to what <em>not</em> to do.</p>

<p>However, I have also seen some very well organized PHP projects that were done in 100% OOP and were a pleasure to maintain, but they were not written by ""php programmers.""</p>

<p>I give all of our junior devs a link to <a href=""http://www.odi.ch/prog/design/newbies.php"">Java Anti-Patterns</a>. One of the nice things about that page is the Java-specific examples because there are many features of Java that lend themselves to common mistakes. I was hoping to find a similar list for php, but a google search did not reveal anything meaningful.</p>

<p>There are a few questions already out there for <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/306497/what-should-every-php-programmer-know"">what a developer should know when programming PHP</a>, but I wanted to focus on the negative.</p>

<p>What are the common things you have seen in PHP that should be avoided and what is a common solution to doing the same thing in a better way?</p>

<p>Some of the obvious examples to me that I think will be mentioned but aren't PHP specific:</p>

<ul>
<li>Don't concatenate SQL. Use prepare statements or proper escaping.</li>
<li>Don't blindly embed PHP into HTML - use templating/MVC.</li>
<li>Don't blindly post raw unfiltered user input - scrub it for XSS attacks.</li>
<li>Don't manually try to parse all of your POSTs and GETs - use a web framework.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here would be some examples that I would consider PHP specific:</p>

<ul>
<li>Don't have too many layers of file include/require linking and try to avoid conditional linking. Rather, have a sane naming convention and be consistent with your organization.</li>
<li>Don't use PHPs raw database API unless you can help it, instead use a database framework like <a href=""http://adodb.sourceforge.net/"">ADODB</a> instead.</li>
<li>Don't overuse PHP's dynamic typing by setting the variable to a string in one place and a boolean somewhere else, then expecting the boolean tests to make sense.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, what are your favorite PHP <em>don'ts</em> and how do you do it right?</p>
","70393","","<p>One of my favourite DON'Ts would have to be:</p>

<pre><code>$query = 'select * from users where username = ' . $_POST['username'];

","70393","","<p>It's generally considered 'better' practice to keep <strong>application-level</strong> configuration directives in a separate configuration text or XML file. You can create a class that's loaded as a singleton instance that parses the file and gives you what you want, e.g:</p>

<pre><code>function fnCreateTestXML($testid)
{
	$objQuery = new clsQuery();
	$objTest = new clsTest();
	$setnames = $objQuery-&gt;fnSelectRecords(""tbl_testsets"", ""setnumber"", """");

				//Creating Root node test and set its attribute 
				$doc = new DomDocument('1.0','utf-8');
				$root = $doc-&gt;createElement('test');
				$root = $doc-&gt;appendChild($root);
				//and so on

//Saving XML on the disk
				$xml_create = $doc-&gt;saveXML();
				$testname = ""testsxml.xml"";
				$xml_string = $doc-&gt;save($testname);

","70393","","<p>Using Smarty as a templating engine will probably not be as performant as not using it, as it is an extra layer of software, i.e., a templating language on top of a, erm, another templating language. On the other hand, if you use the caching feature properly you could realise overall performance gains.</p>

<p>I would build the form in plain-old HTML, you could use the jQuery <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Tabs"" rel=""nofollow"">tabs</a> plugin to divide the form up into pages in a sleeker way, and the jQuery <a href=""http://malsup.com/jquery/form/"" rel=""nofollow"">form</a> plugin to assist with serialization of the form and ajax submission.</p>

<p>There's also the jQuery <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation"" rel=""nofollow"">validation</a> plugin, but I've never tried it out.</p>

<p>Good luck with that.</p>

"<p>I have a form split apart throughout 4 tabs. One of the tabs contains photos if the user has uploaded some. Under each photo is a button to delete the photo. It performs an AJAX call to delete the photo and load in a new input[file] field that the user can use to upload another photo.</p>

<p>This works fine. The problem is after the user uploads the new photo, it appears as if the old photo is still there. If the user refreshes the browser, it doesn't go away. The user literally has to hold shift and then refresh (bypass cache). </p>

<p>The problem most likely stems from the fact that the new image gets named the same as the old one... and the browser is simply pulling from it's cache.</p>

<p>What do I need to do to prevent that from occurring? I've already set {cache : false} on the jQueryUI tabs. I believe it has to do with the image being cached by the browser. Is there a way to tell the browser to not cache a few images?</p>
","70393","","<p>Try adding a parameter to the image tag source filename, such as the current timestamp to break the browser's cache? Something like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;img src=""something.jpg?234343234""/&gt;

"<p>I currently have a website which contains on the main page a list of articles that each one of them has an image next to it.

<p>Is there a way to ensure that they are loaded (even with js)?</p>

<p>The URLs are definitely fine, I suspect the sites which the images are from are not responding too well, but still, when I try myself it's working.</p>
","70393","","<p>It could be that the sites you are linking to have image hotlinking protection mechanisms in place or such, to reduce the load on their servers. </p>

"<p>There are many conflicting statements around, what is the best way to row count using PDO in PHP? Before using PDO I just simply used <code>mysql_num_rows</code>.</p>

<p><code>fetchAll</code> is something I won't want as I may sometimes be dealing with large datasets, so not good for my use.</p>

<p>Any suggestions?</p>

$result = $con-&gt;prepare($sql); 
$result-&gt;execute(); 
$number_of_rows = $result-&gt;fetchColumn(); 
</code></pre>

<p>Not the most elegant way to do it, plus it involves an extra query.</p>

<p>PDO has <code>PDOStatement::rowCount()</code>, which apparently does <strong>not</strong> work in MySql. What a pain.</p>

<p>From the PDO Doc:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For most databases,
  PDOStatement::rowCount() does not
  return the number of rows affected by
  a SELECT statement. Instead, use
  PDO::query() to issue a SELECT
  COUNT(*) statement with the same
  predicates as your intended SELECT
  statement, then use
  PDOStatement::fetchColumn() to
  retrieve the number of rows that will
  be returned. Your application can then
  perform the correct action.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>EDIT: The above code example uses a prepared statement, which is in many cases is probably unnecessary for the purpose of counting rows, so:</p>

<pre><code>$nRows = $pdo-&gt;query('select count(*) from blah')-&gt;fetchColumn(); 
echo $nRows;

","70393","","<p>It is not bad practice to have multiple <code>$().ready</code>'s, unless you've needlessly broken it up into multiple ones.

</blockquote>



<p>I'm programming a community website.</p>

<p>I want to build a ""forgot my password"" feature.</p>

<p>Looking around at different sites, I've found they employ one of <strong>three options</strong>:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>send the user an <strong>email with a link to a unique, hidden URL</strong> that allows him to change his password (Gmail and Amazon)</p></li>
<li><p>send the user an email with a <strong>new, randomly generated password</strong> (Wordpress)</p></li>
<li><p>send the user <strong>his current password</strong> (www.teach12.com)</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Option #3</strong> seems the most convenient to the user but since I save passwords as an MD5 hash, I don't see how option #3 would be available to me since <strong>MD5 is irreversible</strong>. This also seems to be <strong>insecure</strong> option since it means that the website must be saving the password in clear text somewhere, and at the least the clear-text password is being sent over insecure e-mail to the user. Or am I missing something here?</p>

<p>So if I can't do option #1, <strong>option #2</strong> seems to be the <strong>simplest to program</strong> since I just have to change the user's password and send it to him. Although this is <strong>somewhat insecure</strong> since you have to have a live password being communicated via insecure e-mail. However, this could also be misused by trouble-makers to <strong>pester users</strong> by typing in random e-mails and constantly changing passwords of various users.</p>

<p><strong>Option #1</strong> seems to be the <strong>most secure</strong> but requires a little extra programming to deal with a hidden URL that expires etc., but it seems to be what the big sites use.</p>

<p><strong>What experience have you had using/programming these various options? Are there any options I've missed?</strong></p>

"<p>I have a project that is currently all over the place and i'm thinking of making it MVC.</p>

<p>The problem is that the system is currently being used and I can not change the interface (It's in frames :s) Also there are certain things that I will need to handle myself such as password generation, login and user levels.</p>

<p>I already have the model side down of the MVC so I am wondering is it worth using a framework like Zend Framework or CakePHP or just to code my own View and Controllers to work around this problem?</p>

<p>I am going to have to work this in slowly and I'm not sure if i will be able to do that if I use one of the ready made frameworks.</p>
","70393","","<p>Wheel reinvention is bad. Use a tried and tested framework like Zend Framework unless you have a really, really special reason not to.</p>

<p>What exactly is coding by convention?</p>
","70393","","<p>It means if you stick to certain coding conventions as defined by whatever convention-based framework you are using, you get a lot of functionality for free. In other words, if you structure your application in accordance to what the framework expects, a lot of work can be saved.</p>

","70393","","<p>I have faced a similar problem. Try two things:</p>

<p>1) Give the table an absolute width in pixels, e.g. 500px</p>

"<p>This is a javascript security question:  suppose a page finds out the screen resolution of the computer, such as 1024 x 768, and want to use an AJAX call to log this data into the DB.</p>

<p>Is there a way to actually prevent fake data from being entered into the DB?  I think whatever the HTML or Javascript does, the user can reverse engineer the code so that some fake numbers get entered into the DB, or is there a way prevent it from happening totally? (100% secure).</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: or in a similar situation... if i write a simple javascript game... is there a way for the user to send back the score by AJAX and lie about their score?</p>
","70393","","<p>To attempt an answer by elaborating on comments made by Dok, and yourself, there is a clear distinction between manipulating an application to 'cheat' it out of something, whether it be an online business to get something cheaper or a MMPORG to get more experience, than manipulating it in such a way that it renders the interface incorrectly and diminishes the overall user experience for that particular (hacker?) user.</p>

<p>Your time would be better spent focusing on other aspects of your site. I don't recommend the users of my site manipulate the HTML to make it look funny on their machines, but I'm not going to go all out and obfuscate my server output to stop them from hurting themselves. In your case, range checking against pre-defined safe values, making use of the DB, to ensure the user is viewing with an 'allowed' resolution puts unnecessary burden on your application, and takes time to do.</p>

"<p>can anyone advise on what the best PHP function is for displaying an image stored on the filesystem - <code>file_get_contents</code> or <code>readfile</code>.

"<p>With the help of this community, I've been able to pass a static chunk of text from javascript (clientside) to ASP 3.5 (server side)! This piece of code works beautifully:</p>

<pre><code>$('.drop').droppable({
    tolerance: ""touch"", // Here should be a string
    drop: function() {

    $('[id$=""myHidden""]').val('Testy test test');
    __doPostBack('&lt;%= HiddenButton.UniqueID  %&gt;', '');
    alert($('[id$=""myHidden""]').val());

    }


});
</code></pre>

<p>What the above does, is when an element with the class of .drop is dropped, it will assign the string ""Testy test test"" to my hidden field on my aspx page. Then it does a postback to an invisible button I have that is within an updatepanel. The hidden button's click event fires, which throws up a msgbox displaying the contents of the hidden element, which invariably are ""Testy test test"".</p>

<p>Now here is where I'm having some problems. Of whatever I drop into the dropzone, instead of setting the hidden field's value to a static string, I want to set it to the ID of whatever it was I dropped into the dropzone. This is what I changed:</p>

<pre><code> $('[id$=""myHidden""]').val($(ui.draggable).attr(""id""));
    __doPostBack('&lt;%= HiddenButton.UniqueID  %&gt;', '');
    alert($('[id$=""myHidden""]').val());
</code></pre>

<p>Now all of a sudden, when I drop something it stays glued to the dropzone, and no drop event fires. Did I break something? Or am I trying to get the ID of the dropped element the wrong way?</p>

<p>In case it matters, here is the relevant aspx page stuff:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;asp:Button ID=""HiddenButton"" runat=""server"" Text=""Button"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>That button is typically hidden via css, I just left it unhidden for now for testing purposes.</p>

"<p>How do I make it so that the browser calls up a php page and posts the results in a div every 10 seconds or so?</p>

<p>jQuery's <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Ajax"" rel=""nofollow"">$.ajax</a> function gets the output of the resource specified by <strong>url</strong>, and the success callback allows you to do some processing with the results, in the example above:</p>

","70393","","<p>You could cache the output of the external site, and let it renew itself say every 5-10 seconds. That would kill the impact of a lot of 'pings' from your site. It really depends on how important timing accuracy is to your customer/client.</p>

<p>In a high traffic situation I would have a separate script that runs a a daemon or cron job and fetches the weather every specified interval, and overwrites the public website page when done. That way, you've not to worry about caching as it's done by a background task, your visitors are merely accessing a static page from the web server. That also avoids or at least minimises the need to incorporate a database into the equation, and is fairly light-weight.</p>

Will <code>$_FILES['myflie']['size'] &lt;=0</code> work?</p>
","70393","","<p>You can use <a href=""http://www.php.net/is_uploaded_file""><code>is_uploaded_file()</code></a>:</p>

<pre><code>if(!file_exists($_FILES['myfile']['tmp_name']) || !is_uploaded_file($_FILES['myfile']['tmp_name'])) {
    echo 'No upload';
}
</code></pre>

<p>From the docs:
Returns TRUE if the file named by:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>filename was uploaded via HTTP POST.
  This is useful to help ensure that a
  malicious user hasn't tried to trick
  the script into working on files upon
  which it should not be working--for
  instance, /etc/passwd.</p>
  
  <p>This sort of check is especially
  important if there is any chance that
  anything done with uploaded files
  could reveal their contents to the
  user, or even to other users on the
  same system.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>EDIT: I'm using this in my FileUpload class, in case it helps:</p>

<pre><code>public function fileUploaded()
{
    if(empty($_FILES)) {
        return false;       
    } 
    $this-&gt;file = $_FILES[$this-&gt;formField];
    if(!file_exists($this-&gt;file['tmp_name']) || !is_uploaded_file($this-&gt;file['tmp_name'])){

"<p>I have a page that uses jQuery to create a number of <strong><code>&lt;input&gt;</code></strong> DOM elements dynamically based on what user picks from a <strong><code>&lt;select&gt;</code></strong> box.</p>

<p>Let's say the user picks 4 from the select box, my script dynamically shows 4 input boxes. </p>

<p>The problem is when the user refreshes or goes back to this page (with the browser back button). The elements that are created dynamically are not repopulated to their last values, while all the other 'static' elements are.</p>

<p>I was thinking I could create a <strong>hidden input</strong> that would be serialized through javascript with the contents of the dynamic boxes, then read from it on <strong>$document.ready</strong> and then repopulate my boxes.</p>

<p>Is there a better way?</p>
","70393","","<p>legenden - there are a number of possible solutions to this, I would check out these history plugins for one:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://stilbuero.de/jquery/history/"" rel=""nofollow"">History Remote</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://www.mikage.to/jquery/jquery_history.html"" rel=""nofollow"">jQuery History plugin</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://www.asual.com/jquery/address/"" rel=""nofollow"">Deep Linking plugin</a></li>
</ul>

<p>They are a little fidgety, but you should be able to hack up something positive. I will also add, that this can probably be done by storing the dynamically elements in a cookie(s) and somehow repopulating. Check out the <a href=""http://plugins.jquery.com/project/Cookie"" rel=""nofollow"">jQuery Cookie plugin</a>. Hope that helped you get started.</p>

"<p>I'm starting to write quite a few ajax heavy website, but I've never really read up on best practices and now that I want too I can't find an article that address what I want to know.  What I really want to learn about is dealing with AJAX calls server side, things such as, should all data be passed back using JSON/XML,.. or is pure HTML fine, should you try not to mix the two for a single function call depending on the result.  Also, as I mostly program using CodeIgniter (an MVC framework) how best do you go about dividing normal page load requests from AJAX results.</p>

<p>I can make AJAX websites, but want I really want to know is how best to make an AJAX website, if people can shed some light or point me in the right direction I would very much appreciated it.</p>

<p>Thanks
Tom</p>
","70393","","<p>It depends on what you're trying to achieve with AJAX. There's normally a footprint/complexity tradeoff. </p>

<p>For instance, you can have an AJAX call retrieve an entire generated HTML list from the server, including markup, and just inject that into a container such as a div. That's simple to implement, but the down-side would be having to send more bytes to the browser.</p>

<p>On the other hand, you could have the server send out a JSON string in response to an AJAX call and have the client wrap each bit in appropriate markup and place it in the page. That's more complex, but might be better suited to certain situations.</p>

<p>It really depends on what you're trying to achieve, there is no single general rule governing a 'best way to implement AJAX'.</p>

"<p>I am working on optimizing my site, and I have had the MySQL slow queries log on for a few days now, but after going through >260M queries, it only logged 6 slow queries, and those were special ones executed by me on phpMyAdmin.  I am wondering if there is something to log slow PHP page execution time so that I can find certain pages that are hogging resources, rather than specific queries.</p>
","70393","","<p>You could wrap your scripts in a simple timer, like this:</p>

<pre><code>/*in your header or at the top of the page*/
$time_start = microtime(true); 

/* your script goes here */

/*in your footer, or at the bottom of the page*/
$time_end = microtime(true);
$time = $time_end - $time_start;   
echo ""It took $time seconds\n"";

"<p>We were set an algorithm problem in class today, as a ""if you figure out a solution you don't have to do this subject"". SO of course, we all thought we will give it a go.</p>

<p>Basically, we were provided a DB of 100 words and 10 categories. There is no match between either the words or the categories. So its basically a list of 100 words, and 10 categories.</p>

<p>We have to ""place"" the words into the correct category - that is, we have to ""figure out"" how to put the words into the correct category. Thus, we must ""understand"" the word, and then put it in the most appropriate category algorthmically. </p>

<p>i.e. one of the words is ""fishing"" the category ""sport"" --> so this would go into this category. There is some overlap between words and categories such that some words could go into more than one category.</p>

<p>If we figure it out, we have to increase the sample size and the person with the ""best"" matching % wins.</p>

<p>Does anyone have ANY idea how to start something like this? Or any resources ? Preferably in C#? </p>

<p>Even a keyword DB or something might be helpful ? Anyone know of any free ones?</p>
","70393","","<p>You could do a custom algorithm to work specifically on that data, for instance words ending in 'ing' are verbs (present participle) and could be sports.</p>

<p>Create a set of categorization rules like the one above and see how high an accuracy you get.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Steal the wikipedia database (it's free anyway) and get the list of articles under each of your ten categories. Count the occurrences of each of your 100 words in all the articles under each category, and the category with the highest 'keyword density' of that word (e.g. fishing) wins.</p>

<p>Ive been studying over this and trying different things for a while. Could someone point me in the right direction? Id love to learn what im missing here.</p>
","70393","","<p>I've isolated the problem to at least two methods in domain.class.php, which are broken. Here is a quick fix. </p>

<p>Take away the domain validation:</p>

<pre><code>function is_valid(){ //because this always returns false
    return true;
</code></pre>

<p>also, <code>get_whois_server()</code> always returns nothing. So we return a literal string from <code>get_whois_server()</code>, i.e:</p>

<pre><code>function get_whois_server(){
    return ""whois.geektools.com""; //the whois server declared in the class does work
</code></pre>

<p>Lastly, whois.geektools.com changed their No Match string to ""no information"" and that's how we know when a domain <strong>is</strong> available. Change the array at the beginning of the class to:</p>

<pre><code>array(""com"",""whois.geektools.com"",""no information""), //No match to ""no information""
        array(""net"",""whois.geektools.com"",""No match""),
                array(""org"",""whois.geektools.com"",""No match""),
);
</code></pre>

<p>Then as expected:</p>

<pre><code> $domain = new domain(""google.com""); //make sure to leave out http:// and www
 if(....
    ....
 //Returns ""is unavailable"";
</code></pre>

<p>And</p>

<pre><code> $domain = new domain(""jsdhfsdfkljsadhjds.com""); //make sure to leave out http:// and www
 if(....
    ....
 //Returns ""is available"";

"<p>I have a requirement in my project to provide an autocomplete feature for a textBox like the one recently applied on Google. I need to fetch data on each keystroke so I am calling a jQuery function on keypress. The problem is the Autocomplete feature gets triggered on mouse click in the textBox and not on keypress. I will attach the code snippet for a better understanding of the problem which goes like this </p>

<pre><code>$(document).keypress(function(){ 
    lastKey = String.fromCharCode(window.event.keyCode); 
    alert('lastKey :: ' + lastKey);
    var txtVal = document.frm.selectedTechParamName.value + lastKey; 
    alert('txtVal :: ' + txtVal); 
    $(""#suggestTechParamName"").autocomplete('/AEA-Authoring/TechnicianParameterAutocomplete?userAction=getTechParamsForSvcLvlDataID&amp;txtVal=' + txtVal, { 
        matchContains: true, 
        minChars: 0, 
        cacheLength:0, 
        maxItemsToShow:10
    }); 
}); 
</code></pre>

<p>Now what's going on is when any key is pressed the alerts are working properly, but the second half of the function i.e. </p>

<pre><code>$(""#suggestTechParamName"").autocomplete('/AEA-Authoring/TechnicianParameterAutocomplete?userAction=getTechParamsForSvcLvlDataID&amp;txtVal=' + txtVal, { 
    matchContains: true, 
    minChars: 0, 
    cacheLength:0, 
    maxItemsToShow:10
}); 
</code></pre>

<p>gets called when we click on the textBox. Also as you can see the attribute ""cacheLength:0"" which I have written is because I do not want Autocomplete to cache any data, but this also does not seem working. Any quick response would be appreciated. </p>
","70393","","<p>Try unbinding the click event from the textbox you have attached your autocompleter to:</p>

"<p>I'm playing around with MySQLi at the moment, trying to figure out how it all works. In my current projects I always like to echo out a query string while coding, just to make sure that everything is correct, and to quickly debug my code. But... how can I do this with a prepared MySQLi statement?</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>$id = 1;
$baz = 'something';

if ($stmt = $mysqli->prepare(""SELECT foo FROM bar WHERE id=? AND baz=?"")) {
  $stmt->bind_param('is',$id,$baz);
  // how to preview this prepared query before acutally executing it?
  // $stmt->execute();
}</code></pre>

<p><br /><b>EDIT</b></p>

<p>Well, if it's not possible from within MySQLi, maybe I'll stick with something like this:</p>

<pre><code>function preparedQuery($sql,$params) {
  for ($i=0; $i&lt;count($params); $i++) {
    $sql = preg_replace('/\?/',$params[$i],$sql,1);
  }
  return $sql;
}

$id = 1;
$baz = 'something';

$sql = ""SELECT foo FROM bar WHERE id=? AND baz=?"";

echo preparedQuery($sql,array($id,$baz));

// outputs: SELECT foo FROM bar WHERE id=1 AND baz=something

<p>Far from perfect obviously, since it's still pretty redundant &mdash; something I wanted to prevent &mdash; and it also doesn't give me an idea as to what's being done with the data by MySQLi. But I guess this way I can quickly see if all the data is present and in the right place, and it'll save me <em>some</em> time compared to fitting in the variables manually into the query &mdash; that can be a pain with many vars.</p>
","70393","","<p>I don't think you can - at least not in the way that you were hoping for.

"<p>Anyone know how to disable a link in jquery WITHOUT using <code>return false;</code>?</p>

<p>Specifically, what I'm trying to do is disable the link of an item, performing a click on it using jquery which triggers some stuff, then re-enabling that link so that if it's clicked again it works as default.</p>

<p>Thanks.
Dave</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>
Here's the code. What it needs to do after the <code>.expanded</code> class has been applied is to re-enable the disabled link.</p>

<pre><code>$('ul li').click(function(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    $('ul').addClass('expanded');
    $('ul.expanded').fadeIn(300);

    e.preventDefault();
    //do other stuff when a click happens

<p>That will prevent the default behaviour of a hyperlink, which is to visit the specified href.</p>

<p>From the jQuery <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:How%5FjQuery%5FWorks"">tutorial</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For click and most other events, you
  can prevent the default behaviour -
  here, following the link to jquery.com
  - by calling event.preventDefault() in the event handler</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you want to <code>preventDefault()</code> only if a certain condition is fulfilled (something is hidden for instance), you could test the visibility of your ul with the class <strong>expanded</strong>. If it is visible (i.e. not hidden) the link should fire as normal, as the if statement will not be entered, and thus the default behaviour will not be prevented:</p>

<pre><code>$('ul li').click(function(e) {
    if($('ul.expanded').is(':hidden')) {
        e.preventDefault();
        $('ul').addClass('expanded');
        $('ul.expanded').fadeIn(300);

"<p>I've been using yuicompressor.jar on my test server for on-the-fly minimisation of changed JavaScript files. Now that I have deployed the website to the public server, I noticed that the server's policies forbid the use of exec() or its equivalents, so no more java execution for me.</p>

<p>Is there a decent on-the-fly JS compressor implemented in PHP? The only thing resembling this that I was able to find was Minify, but it's more of a full-blown compression solution with cache and everything. I want to keep the files separate and have the minimised files follow my own naming conventions, so Minify is a bit too complex for this purpose.</p>

<p>The tool, like yuicompressor, should be able to take either a filename or JavaScript as input and should either write to a file or output the compressed JavaScript.</p>

<p>EDIT: To clarify, I'm looking for something that does not have to be used as a standalone (i.e. it can be called from a function, rather than sniffing my GET variables). If I just wanted a compressor, Minify would obviously be a good choice.</p>

<p>EDIT2: A lot has changed in the five years since I asked this question. Today I would strongly recommend separating the front-end workflow from the server code. There are plenty of good tools for JS development around and except for the most trivial jQuery enhancements it's a better idea to have a full workflow with automated bundling, testing and linting in place and just deploy the minified bundles rather than the raw files.</p>

"<p>Ok, I'm a bit new when it comes to jQuery and json.  If I'm using json as my return type, can I still retrieve responseText from an XMLHttpRequest object?</p>

$.ajax({
        type: ""POST"",

<p>how can i still use the above code with XMLHttpRequest to get the status, responseText, etc.</p>

<p>thanks, all!</p>
","70393","","<p>As far as I know, the call to $.ajax returns a XHR object, and from that the responseText can be extracted, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>var xhr = $.ajax( {
                        url:' someInfo.php',
                        data: 'which=squirrels',

                } );

var resp = xhr.responseText;
</code></pre>

<p>The response text will contain a json string, which would need to be converted to an object to be of any use.</p>

<p>If you want to use the response as a json object directly within your <code>success</code>: function, do as @cloudhead suggested, and use <strong>msg</strong>. The dataType : ""json"" in your <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Ajax/jQuery.ajax#options"">options</a> takes care of the conversion for you.</p>

"<p>I seem to have a bizarre error I just can't quite figure out. My website was working on one server, but when I transferred it to a new one it stopped working. I believe I've narrowed the error down to this line of code:</p>

<pre><code>$ret = move_uploaded_file($tmp_name, $orig_path);
</code></pre>

<p>This is executed through an AJAX call so it's a little bit tricky to debug, but the script can send back an error code and then my JavaScript will <code>alert</code> it. So, I've wrapped it in two of these debug statements:</p>

<pre><code>echo json_encode(array(

    'success' =&gt; false,

    'errno' =&gt; $tmp_name.' -&gt; '.$orig_path,

));

<p>Perhaps I'm a bit of a linux noob, but I can't actually find <code>/tmp/phpk3RICU</code> on my system (is it deleted as soon as the script exits or what?). More on that in a sec though.</p>

<p>If I delete the first debug check and let <code>move_uploaded_file</code> run, the 2nd debug check never seems to get executed, which leads me to believe move_uploaded_file is hanging.</p>

<p>If instead of using <code>$tmp_name</code> I use a file I <em>know</em> doesn't exist, then the 2nd check DOES get executed. So... it seems like it just doesn't want to move that tmp file, but it's not reporting an error.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: <code>move_uploaded_file()</code> is both
  safe mode and <code>open_basedir</code> aware.
  However, restrictions are placed only
  on the destination path as to allow
  the moving of uploaded files in which
  filename may conflict with such
  restrictions. <code>move_uploaded_file()</code>
  ensures the safety of this operation
  by allowing only those files uploaded

<p>That selects the parent of the textbox, which is your <code>&lt;div class=""formfield""&gt;</code>, then finds the element with class <strong>hint</strong> inside it, thus eliminating the need for an ID and a more complex way to get the contained hint div.</p>

"<p>I'm curious to know people's preferences...</p>

<p>I've recently gone head-first into jQuery and I am loving it. However, I'm finding that I'm replacing a lot of (somewhat trivial) backend (tech: ASP.NET) functions with tiny jQuery functions. For instance, rather than assign a navigation button as a back-end control and change its class when its page is landed on (ie, highlight the ""about"" button when on the about us page), I simply parsed the URL and added a class to the button:</p>

<pre><code>var pathname = window.location.pathname;
if (pathname == ""/about/"") {
    $(""#nav-about"").addClass(""selected"");
}
</code></pre>

<p>Solutions like these seem rather simple (maybe too simple), but I am always wary to rely too heavily on JavaScript. Does anyone else do similar things to this, and if so, how do you maintain code like this? How do you know where to strike the balance between good ol' trusty server code that works every time and fast, fancy, shiny jQuery that works pretty much every time, except when the user may have JavaScript turned off?</p>

<h2>EDIT</h2>

<p>I'm not really speaking of this particular instance... I'm talking about little enhancements like this. What is the line you draw when it comes to jQuery enhancements or just do it on the server? Thanks :)</p>
","70393","","<p>I tend to go for graceful degradation in terms of behaviour, I'm not so bothered with what stuff looks like on the client side, as long as the system works and can deliver in terms of its business requirements. Styles and colours and all those pretty things belong only in the text that is served to the browser, and not in the the back-end code, unless the goal of a stylistic element is to provide functionality that is <strong>required</strong> (such emboldening a link to show that we are on that page). </p>

<p>That said, I realise that at the same time I love using jQuery and the fact that it gives me license to perform all manner of cool client-side antics in a very short space of time. So what I tend to aim to build is a system that is solid (like in the good old days before all of this scripting nonsense :) and that does what it is supposed to. Having achieved that, and for extra pats on the shoulder (and real rep), I will use jQuery to jazz up the whole user experience, in a non-compromising way. To provide a simple example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a class=""pageNo"" href=""/?p={$pageNo}""&gt;{$pageNo}&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>is a page link, clicking on it will load some results into to a div, the implementation is something like:</p>

<pre><code>jQuery('.pageNumber').click(function(e) {

            //stop the link from firing
            e.preventDefault();

            //steal the page number from the tag
            var pageNo = jQuery(this).text();

            //assign it to a hidden field
            jQuery('#pageNo').val(pageNo);

            //use $.load to fill up a div with the results
            loadPage(pageNo);


        });
</code></pre>

<p>The link points to a resource on the server that looks like <code>www.random.com/things/?p=2</code>. jQuery's <code>$.load</code> function fetches this page and inserts it into a div, ajaxily. If Javascript fails, or is not available, it's no big deal because the link fires as normal and the page is visited, just like in the good old days. Furthermore, the server is set up to differentiate between an XHTTP Request and a normal one, and respond accordingly. jQuery, in this case, made for a really neat enhancement that did not at all compromise on the service delivery aspect of the project.</p>

<p>These days I frequently find myself designing things in terms of how I might use jQuery to do this, that and the other, and that's where I have to take a step backwards and remember that the important stuff <strong>has</strong> to be got right before the experimental and controversial 'enhancements' can start to be rolled out.<code>&lt;sigh&gt;</code></p>

"<p>I have the following pretty standard process:</p>

<ol>
<li>I initialise my page in <code>$(document).ready</code>. This includes binding events to elements in a table.</li>
<li>The content of the table is then refreshed dynamically through an ajax call</li>
</ol>

<p>I now need to rebind events to the table content. Is there a standard way of doing this? i.e. is there an equivalent of <code>$(document).ready</code> that fires after a <strong>partial</strong> page DOM update?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
","70393","","<p>Have a look at event delegation using <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Events/live"" rel=""nofollow"">live</a>. From the docs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When you bind a ""live"" event it will
  bind to all current and future
  elements on the page (using event
  delegation). For example if you bound
  a live click to all ""li"" elements on
  the page then added another li at a
  later time - that click event would
  continue to work for the new element
  (this is not the case with bind which
  must be re-bound on all new elements).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An example:</p>

<pre><code>$('#myTable td').live(""click"", function() {
    alert('hello!');
});
</code></pre>

<p>That will preserve the event(s) bound to the cells on the table even after it has been replaced. The <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Events/live"" rel=""nofollow"">live</a> manual says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Binds a handler to an event (like
  click) for all current - and future -
  matched element.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Alternatively, you can wrap your bindings into a function, and have that execute as a callback to the method that updates your table data, for instance:</p>

<pre><code>function bindStuffToTable()
{
    $('#myTable td').click(function() {
       alert('Hello!');
    });
}

$('#myTable').load('/some/link', bindStuffToTable);
</code></pre>

<p>Or if the entire table gets replaced dynamically, which is more likely:</p>

<pre><code>$('#someButton').click(function() {
    //replaces the contents of someDiv with the table generated by foo.php
    $('#someDiv').load('foo.php', bindStuffToTable);
});

<p>Is there any difference between <code>print</code> and <code>echo</code> in PHP? If so, which should I use and when? If not, why are there two keywords?</p>

<p>UPDATE : </p>

<p>At the downvoters : please read the SO faq. SO was setup also to capture googleable questions. so you shouldn't downvote for that, this question is a valid question, answered on a lot of places and now on SO too. </p>

<p>Of course you can downvote for another reason, but please leave a comment in the lines of

","70393","","<p>From <a href=""http://www.faqts.com/knowledge%5Fbase/view.phtml/aid/1/fid/40"">this link</a>, suggested by the <a href=""http://www.php.net/echo"">PHP manual entry for the <code>echo()</code> function</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li><p>Speed.  There is a difference between the two, but speed-wise it
  should be irrelevant which one you
  use.  echo is marginally faster  since
  it doesn't set a return value if you
  really want to get down to the nitty
  gritty.  </p></li>
  <li><p>Expression.  print() behaves like a function in that you can do:  $ret =
  print ""Hello World""; And $ret will be</p></li>
  <li><p>That means that print can be used as part of a more complex expression
  where echo cannot.  An example from
  the PHP Manual:</p>
  
  <p>$b ? print ""true"" : print ""false"";</p></li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>print is also part of the precedence
  table which it needs to be if it  is
  to be used within a complex
  expression. It is just about at the
  bottom of the precedence list though. 
  Only "","" AND, OR and XOR are lower.</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>Parameter(s).  The grammar is: echo expression [, expression[, expression]
  ... ] But echo ( expression,
  expression ) is not valid.  This would
  be valid: echo (""howdy""),(""partner"");
  the same as: echo ""howdy"",""partner"";<br />
  (Putting the brackets in that simple
  example  serves no purpose since there
  is no operator precedence issue with a
  single term like that.)</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>So, echo without parentheses can take
  multiple parameters, which get
  concatenated:</p>
  
  <p>echo  ""and a "", 1, 2, 3;   //
  comma-separated without parentheses<br />
  echo (""and a 123"");        // just one
  parameter with parentheses</p>
  
  <p>print() can only take one parameter:</p>
  
  <p>print (""and a 123"");    print  ""and
  a 123"";</p>

","70393","","<p>What you can do is to set the base font size (the font-size property on the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element) to around 62.8% (some say 62.5%):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;body style=""font-size:62.5%;""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This makes the base font, or 1.0em, approximately equal to 10px. It's not exact, and changes from font to font, but generally speaking it's accurate enough. Having done that, you can use EMs and their pixel equivalents:</p>

<p>1.0em = 10px, 1.1em = 11px, 1.2em = 12px etc.</p>

<p>So you can easily convert from pixels to EMs, by dividing by 10:</p>

","70393","","<p>Just to add, some would say that storing the UNIX time as a plain-old int field in the database is the more flexible and portable solution. Furthermore, inserts and updates happen faster because they only involve storing simple integers. It really depends on how much date manipulation you <em>need</em> to do at the database level.

<p>or </p>

<p>The problem with the class is that there was a method named ""Test"" (the same as the class name)... I changed it and it worked.</p>
","70393","","<p>Following your particular example and use case, the only way to achieve this exactly:</p>

<pre><code>$testObj = new Test();

<p>would be to use <a href=""http://www.php.net/eval"" rel=""nofollow"">eval()</a>:</p>

<pre><code>class Test
{

    public function test($methodName) {
        eval($methodName);

$testObj = new Test();

<p>Others pointed out a solution using <a href=""http://nz.php.net/manual/en/function.call-user-func.php"" rel=""nofollow""><code>call_user_func()</code></a> and rightly so. Also evidently, is faster than using eval() for function calls. Read this:</p>

"<p>In order to choose categories, I want to use dropdown lists. Each list contains one level of categories. So it's: top level, sub, subsub, subsubsub etc. Every level is dynamically retrieved through my script <code>getcat.php</code>, which shows a <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> object.</p>

<p>The retrieval so far works with the following code. However, since it's a form, I want to get the last selected value so I can have the category id. This is not working for me. I tried <code>$(""select:last option:selected"")</code>, but that's not working with newly inserted elements.</p>

<p>After selecting the category, an input field must show up where the user can make his own subcategory (inside the category selected). This, too, is not working with the new elements.</p>

<p>Now, I tried to play with .live but that doesn't support change events. Do you guys have any tips on how to improve it?</p>

<p>Currently I've got the following code:</p>

<pre><code>$(""select"").bind(""change"", function(){
    $(this).nextAll().remove();
    var value = $(this).val();
    $(""#currentcat"").val(value);
    if($(""select:last option:selected"").hasClass('makenew')) {
        $(""#newcat"").show();
    }
    else if($(""select:last option:selected"").hasClass('disabled')) { }
    else {
    $.get(""getcat.php"", { c: value },
        function(data){
            $(""#getcats"").append(data);
        });
    $(""#newcat"").hide();
    }    
});

<p>However, as you can see, it's not a beauty.</p>
","70393","","<p>If you want new <code>&lt;option&gt;</code>s to be bound to the DOM and work across different browsers, I would suggest appending them to your select using document.createElement and document.createTextNode like so:</p>

<pre><code>var opt = document.createElement('option');
opt.value = ""someValue"";
opt.appendChild(document.createTextNode(""someText""));
$('#currentcat').append(opt);
</code></pre>

<p>So instead of using $.get you should probably use <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Ajax/jQuery.getJSON"" rel=""nofollow"">$.getJSON</a> to fetch a JSON object containing the values and text attributes of the options you will be appending to your select. The JSON object retrieved from the server should look like this:</p>

<pre><code>                { ""options"" : [   
                                    { ""text"" : ""Fishing"",  // First element
                                      ""value""  : ""5"" },
                                    
                                    { ""text"" : ""Skiing"",  // Second Element
                                      ""value""  : ""70"" }
                               ]
                }
</code></pre>

<p>Iterating over the object would look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>$.getJSON(""getcat.php"", { c: value }, function(json) {
    var $select = $('&lt;select&gt;&lt;/select&gt;).attr('id','currentcat').attr('name','currentcat').hide(); 
    $.each(json.options, function(i, item) {
        var opt = document.createElement('option');
        opt.value = item.value;
        opt.appendChild(document.createTextNode(item.text));
        $('#currentcat').append(opt);        
    });
    $(""#newcat"").hide();
    $('#someDiv').append($select).show();
});

$('ul').append($lis);
$lis.show(""slow"");
</code></pre>

<p>and it works, so it is conceivable that you could do something like the following, and not have to bother with the headache of iterating over element IDs:</p>

<pre><code>$.load('/items/?p=2',function(data) {
    var $lis = $(data).hide();
    $('ul').append($lis);
    $lis.show(""slow"");
});
</code></pre>

I need do retrieve the value of about 20 strings of about 100 characters each. Which of the following methods would be the quickest, in order to retrieve the variables?</p>

<p>1) reading from a separate include file, where the variables values are assigned (e.g. $var1 = ""blablablah....""; etc)
2) reading from a text file
3) reading from a (small) database - e.g. doing a simple mysql query </p>

<p>And what about a slightly larger case, e.g. about 50 strings up to 300 characters each?</p>

"<p>I am using the <a href=""http://valums.com/ajax-upload/"" rel=""nofollow"">ajax uploader</a>

<p>The Problem is when I am using the json response for the onSubmit.
With <code>$this-&gt;getHelper('Json')-&gt;sendJson($data);</code>
I only get a saveas dialog.</p>

<p>The problem is that the uploader expects every responste to be ""text/html"" but the json helper sends ""application/json"" as mimetype.</p>

"<p>jQuery 1.3.2 minified is 55.9K, and jQuery UI core itself has more than 110K and top of that each component adds more to this core.</p>

<p>I am wondering good reasons to use jQuery UI over plugins. </p>

<p>For example <a href=""http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-accordion/"">jQuery accordion plugin</a> has only 3.8K, <a href=""http://flowplayer.org/tools/download.html"">jQuery Tools</a> which does accordion, tooltips, tabs, scrollable, overlay and expose has only 5.8K, <a href=""http://blog.threedubmedia.com/2009/01/dragdrop-updates.html"">jQuery drag and drop plugin</a> has total 4.8K etc etc.</p>

<p>What is the benefits of using UI instead of using these plugins?
Is it worth to add more than 110k+ for what you are using for?</p>

"<p>I'm developing an application which relies heavily on jQuery for user interaction.<br />
(and if you're browser doesn't support jQuery, then upgrade or don't use my application :)</p>

<p>As normal, one have functions to GET, SET and DELETE data from a table.</p>

<p>In my application, I'm GET'ing and SET'ing a lot of information without page reload. To do this, I mostly use jQuery.post.</p>

<p>A typical code in my JS file looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>jQuery.post(""mypath/jquery_getset_data.php"", { instance: 'getItems_A', itemID: itemID_value},
  function(data) {
    populateItemList(data);
  });
</code></pre>

<p>The <strong>jquery_getset_data.php</strong> contains of many <strong>if</strong> statements:</p>

<pre><code>if($_POST['instance'] == 'getItems_A'){
  // PHP code to get and process data from MySQL DB
}

if($_POST['instance'] == 'setItems_A'){
  // PHP code to process and insert data to MySQL DB
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here's my question: <br /></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is tehre a better way for interaction between JS file and jquery_getset_data.php?</p></li>
<li><p>How can I dynamically call different ""remove item"" functions inside createStoreList? See update 1.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Update 1:</strong>
This is the code that I use to create many different lists.</p>

<pre><code>  function createStoreList(data)
  {
    var ul = jQuery(""&lt;ul/&gt;"");

    // We need to build the html structure in order for this to be registered in DOM.
    // If we don't, jQuery events like .click, .change etc. will not work.      
    for (var i = 0; i &lt; data.length; i++)  
    {
      ul.append(
         jQuery(""&lt;li/&gt;"")
         .attr(""id"", ""listItem_""+data[i].id)
         .append(jQuery(""&lt;span/&gt;"")
            .addClass(""btnRemoveItem"")
            .attr(""title"", ""Remove store from list"")
            .attr(""id"", data[i].id)
            .click(function() { removeItemA(this); })  
          )
         .append(data[i].name + ', ' + data[i].street)
        );              
    }
    return ul;  
  }
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Update 2</strong>
I figured I just could use switch statements. I've tested it and it works.</p>

<pre><code>    .click(function() {
        switch(instance)
        {
          case 'removeListItemA': removeListItemA(this); break; 
          case 'removeListItemA': removeListItemB(this); break;
          case 'removeListItemA': removeListItemC(this); break;
        }
    })
</code></pre>
","70393","","<p>The only thing I would change is in <strong><code>jquery_getset_data.php</code></strong> I would use a switch statement instead of many if statements. jQuery's $.post method is fine for what you're doing, talking to a script that affects the database (deletes/updates/etc) using one of the GET ajax methods ($.load or $.get) breaks the HTTP specification.</p>

"<p>I've been using the Zend Framework rather intensively to develop my website, and I'm now designing the upload interface.
I need to allow the user to upload 1-5 images.
I need to send these images to the database as a BLOB object.

<pre><code>$upload = new Zend_File_Transfer_Adapter_Http();
$upload-&gt;addValidator('Extension', true, 'jpg,png,gif');
$upload-&gt;addValidator('ImageSize', true, array(
        'minwidth' =&gt; 4)); //i preform this check to make sure that it's a real
                           //image, since IsImage only checks MIME. Good Idea?

$upload-&gt;addValidator('Size', true, array(
        'min' =&gt; '5kB' ,

    $messages = $upload-&gt;getMessages();
    echo implode(""\n"", $messages);

<p>First, what is a good, fast and secure way to confirm that the upload file is actually an image? MIME types and extentions can be easily faked. What I did adove seems foolish. Any other ideas?</p>

"<p>So I've set up a pagination system similar to Twitter's where where 20 results are shown and the user can click a link to show the next twenty or all results.

","70393","","<p>From what I can gather you are failing to understand that PHP runs on the server while Javascript runs on the client. Follow @Peter's advice, also read and learn more before diving head first into it and coming up with weirdness like that. A rudimentary fix would be something like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
function deleteRecord(id) {
    if(window.confirm(""Are you sure you want to delete that record?"")) { 
        window.location.href = 'myScript.php?id=' + id;
    }
}
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In your myScript.php:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
$id = $_GET['id'];
mysql_query(""delete from tbl_payments where id = '$id'"") or die(mysql_error());
header(""Location: dashboard.php"");

<p>All three of them are submit buttons. A reset is an input of type=""reset"". Get that sorted. Second of all, I've successfully implemented something like that, and it works on IE6. Try this:</p>

    {
        if(e.which == 13) {

"<p>My understanding is that asking for a work sample is a good way to determine if someone has the skillset you are looking for, as some people just interview well. So I want to ask potential developers to write some sample code for me.</p>

<p>I'm looking for ideas on what kind of small project would be something they could do in an hour or two, and would show that they have a good grasp of OOP, good coding practices, etc. And what to look for once they finish - how to evaluate it fairly and usefully.</p>

<p>For context, I'm a small business owner, interviewing prospective developers, for PHP development on internal projects. I can code PHP but am not an expert (some of the work is refactoring code I've written to be better structured and consistent), and so I'm also looking for what to look for when evaluating the samples, given that I'm not a trained or super experienced programmer.</p>

<p>Especially for people who have done hiring of this type before and used this method.</p>

<p>I was also thinking I could give them some code to refactor, and see how they do on it. Has anyone ever given a refactoring test as part of the hiring process?</p>

<p>Clarification: 
I'm not talking about coding during an interview. I'm talking about coding <em>instead</em> of an interview. For context the inspiration for this question came from this article in FastCompany about how work samples are better predictors of job success than interviews:</p>

"<p>I have a login setup on a site that stores login information in PHP's $_SESSION, and additionally sets a two-week cookie with login information if a checkbox is checked. The user is considered logged in if valid login information is either submitted by POST or either cookie is true.</p>

<p>The behavior on FF3/Chrome is as intended, at least with the ""Remember me"" checkbox checked: log in anywhere and everywhere on the site you are treated as being logged in.</p>

<p>However, someone working with IE6 said that she logged on one place, clicked around on links to other sections of the site, and was asked to log in again. I ran into some trouble with my (Multiple IE) IE6, but I reproduced similar behavior on IE8, including setting Advanced Privacy Settings->Always allow session cookies, and otherwise set cookie permissions to be as tolerant as I could. The behavior was identical: log in one place in a way that should set both _SESSION and the two-week cookie, click on links to another pages, and the page presents you with a login screen because it doesn't recognize you as logged in. PHP is 5.2.8 on a Gentoo server.</p>

<p>Any suggestions or resources to getting recognized cookies?</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>[Added after checking on traffic with Fiddler:]</p>

<p>Thank you; I have downloaded Fiddler 2.</p>

<p>Fiddler is reporting Set-Cookie: [name]=deleted... on the logouts in question. I'm presently puzzled as to why. The included file that checks and displays a login screen only has one area where it can delete the relevant cookies, inside a conditional if $_GET['logout'] is set. I didn't see that happening, and when I put an error_log() statement inside the conditional before the statements to delete cookies, no additional messages appear to be being logged.</p>
","70393","","<p>You'll need to be more specific. Find out exactly how you can replicate this behaviour on both browsers, and you've found your bug. For instance, there might be one or two pages where you're failing to call <code>session_start()</code>.</p>

<p>It's important to remember that, if your particular $_SESSION variable is not being seen, and causing a redirect to your login, it's most probably part of your system that is broken.</p>

"<p>Hey Guys, i m from Germany so please don't judge me for my bad englsh skills. 
I posted this question in some other communitys but nobody could help. So i'll just hope for the best here.
I not a jscript pro or anything. Im just putting stuff together and hope it works. 
So here is what i did. I took the tutorial from nettuts+ about the <a href=""http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/creating-a-filterable-portfolio-with-jquery/"" rel=""nofollow"">""filterable portfolio""</a> stuff and added the jquery-plugin ""jQuery.gridLayout"" (phase-change.org/jquery.gridlayout/) Everything is working fine. The Divs get sorted on the grid and when i click a category-link osme of them disappear. But they should be resorting, after they disappear. Right now the boxes are staying at their position, leaving huge whitespaces all over the place. </p>

<p>My javascript call looks like this</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function(){

	$('ul#navigation a').click(function() {
	$(this).css('outline','none');
	$('ul#navigation .current').removeClass('current');
	$(this).parent().addClass('current');

	var filterVal = $(this).text().toLowerCase().replace(' ','-');

	if(filterVal == 'all') {
		$('#grid li.hidden').fadeIn('slow').removeClass('hidden');
	} else {

		$('#grid .box').each(function() {
			if(!$(this).hasClass(filterVal)) {
				$(this).fadeOut('slow').addClass('hidden');
			} else { 

				$(this).fadeIn('slow').removeClass('hidden');
			}
		});

	}

	return false;	

});
$('#grid').gridLayout('.box', {col_width: 370, min_cols: 2});
	// options - (values above are the defaults)
	// col_width: the width of each grid block
	// min_cols: the minimum number of cols on the page (reducing browser width below this will not decrease number of columns). Set to your largest block (3 = block spans 3 columns)


	// gridchange event fires when window resize forces a grid refresh
	$('#grid').bind( ""gridchange"", function(e){
		console.log('gridchange event fired');
	});

	// returns heights of each column
	console.log( 'gridLayout.info():', $('#grid').gridLayout.info() );

// this forces a redraw of grid

  $('body').gridLayout.refresh();


});

"<p>First, let me start off by saying that I know absolutely nothing about JavaScript or client-side scripting.  All of the programming I've ever done has been server-side, mostly PHP, with some Java thrown in too for good measure.</p>

<p>So, I have absolutely no clue where to start with this problem.  I have an application with very strict password rules.  Users receive a default password when they first are given an account, and must change it immediately.  However, no one ever reads the password requirements the first time, and as such, it always takes multiple tries to create a new password.</p>

<p>So, I've created a table like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=""right""&gt;&amp;bull; Not be the same as your old password&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Not Met&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=""right""&gt;&amp;bull; Not be fewer than eight characters in length&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Not Met&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=""right""&gt;&amp;bull; Contain at least one number&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Not Met&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=""right""&gt;&amp;bull; Contain at least one uppercase letter&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Not Met&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=""right""&gt;&amp;bull; Contain at least one lowercase letter&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Not Met&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

//Later on, inside some &lt;form&gt; tags

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=""right""&gt;Old password:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;input type=""password"" id=""oldpass"" name=""oldpass"" tabindex=""1"" /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=""right""&gt;New password:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;input type=""password"" id=""newpass1"" name=""newpass1"" tabindex=""2"" /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

<p>What I want to have happen is while the user enters text in the fields, JavaScript (I guess) runs in the background and changes the ""Not Met"" text to ""Met"" and makes it green or something if the password validates.  What is the best way to do this?</p>

<p>TIA.</p>
","70393","","<p>Off the top of my head, you could create a function that contains all the validation rules you need, e.g:</p>

<pre><code>function validatePass()
{
    var error = false;
    var oldPass = document.getElementById(""oldPass"").value;
    var newPass = document.getElementById(""newPass"").value;
    if(oldPass != newPass) {
        error = true;
    }
    if(error) {
        document.getElementById(""someCellId"").innerText = 'Not Met';
    } else {
        document.getElementById(""someCellId"").innerText = 'Met';
    }
    //set error to false for the next rule
    error = false;
    //more rules
    //possibly using
    //regular expressions
    //and referencing appropriate
    //not met and met table cells
}

"<p>I'm using Zend_Search_Lucene, the PHP port of Java Lucene. I currently have some code that will build a search query based on an array of strings, finding results for which at least one index field matches each of the strings submitted. Simplified, it looks like this:</p>

<p>(Note: $words is an array constructed from user input.)</p>

<pre><code>$query = new Zend_Search_Lucene_Search_Query_Boolean();
foreach ($words as $word) {
  $term1 = new Zend_Search_Lucene_Index_Term($word, $fieldname1);
  $term2 = new Zend_Search_Lucene_Index_term($word, $fieldname2);
  $multiq = new Zend_Search_Lucene_Search_Query_MultiTerm();

  $multiq-&gt;addTerm($term2);
  $query-&gt;addSubquery($multiq, true);
}
$hits = $index-&gt;find($query);
</code></pre>

<p>What I would <em>like</em> to do is replace <strong>$word</strong> with <strong>($word . '*')</strong> — appending an asterisk to the end of each word, turning it into a wildcard term.</p>

<p>But then, $multiq would have to be a <strong>Zend_Search_Lucene_Search_Query_Wildcard</strong> instead of a <strong>Zend_Search_Lucene_Search_Query_MultiTerm</strong>, and I don't think I would still be able to add multiple Index_Terms to each <strong>$multiq</strong>.</p>

<p>Is there a way to construct a query that's both a Wildcard and a MultiTerm?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","70393","","<p>Not in the way you're hoping to achieve it, unfortunately:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lucene supports single and multiple
  character wildcard searches within
  single terms (but not within phrase
  queries).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and even if it were possible, would probably not be a good idea:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wildcard, range and fuzzy search
  queries may match too many terms. It
  may cause incredible search
  performance downgrade.</p>

<p>I imagine the way to go if you insist on multiple wildcard terms, would be two execute two separate searches, one for each wildcarded term, and bundle the results together.</p>

"<p>the text input only allows three words separated by spaces, and if it exceeds 3, the user can't input anymore, is this possible using jQuery?
I can use keyup event to listen, but how do I stop user from typing in more tokens without using disabled.
This is sort of similar to the native maxlength property for the text input in html except that the maxLength in this case is the number of tokens.</p>

<p>If the user attempts to type in more than three words, the contents will be overwritten with only the first three words. This solution will show characters being removed as they are typed if three words are exceeded, thus providing a bit of feedback. </p>

<p>From the presentation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>PHP supports multi byte in two

"<p>I have a form with (at least) the following two fields:</p>

<ul>
<li>country</li>
<li>club</li>
</ul>

<p>The club is a field that is generated via the <strong>ZendX_JQuery_Form_Element_AutoComplete</strong> Element, that also generates the following javascript code:</p>

<pre><code>$(""#club"").autocomplete({""url"":""\/mywebsite\/\/mycontroller\/autocomplete""});
</code></pre>

<p>I have a database of clubs per country. What I want is that <em>only the clubs are returned for the (user) given country</em>. This list should be retrieved via a remote (ajax) call. The code for that is:</p>

<pre><code> public function autocompleteAction()
    {
        $request = $this-&gt;getRequest();

        $filter = $request-&gt;getParam('q');
        $country = $request-&gt;getParam('country');

        $clublist = getClubListBySubstring($country, $filter);

        $this-&gt;_helper-&gt;autoComplete($clublist);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>I can probably change the above javascript-code, by-passing the generation done by ZendX_JQuery_Form_Element_AutoComplete and add an extra element to the URL that gets interpreted as parameter <strong>country</strong> .</p>

<p>But is there a more elegant solution? I've read something about ExtraParams, would that work, and how?</p>
","70393","","<p>This is one of those 'gray areas' where using the server to generate the Javascript could work against you. Writing the client-side script yourself would benefit you in a number of ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>You'll learn more about jQuery Autocomplete and what you can do with it.</li>
<li>You'll have greater control over the behaviour of the autocompleter.</li>
<li>Your solution will be less dependant on the Zend Framework, and will thus be more portable.</li>
</ul>

<p>I would familiarise myself with the <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Autocomplete/autocomplete#options"" rel=""nofollow"">addition parameters on the jQuery side of things</a>, before looking at <code>ZendX_JQuery_Form_Element_AutoComplete</code> as the end-to-end solution.

<p><a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/LeakyAbstractions.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/LeakyAbstractions.html</a></p>

<p>I've implemented an autocompleter (tied to a ZF controller action) and was fully aware of the existence of ZF's autocomplete helper, but chose not to use it, as I did not want to be in one of those situations where applying a minor tweak would necessitate scrapping the entire solution because the code generation tool on the server doesn't want to play.</p>

<p>I am thinking about to extend it (helper) so it could return all JavaScript resources (from ""ClientSideResources"" subfolder in <code>App_LocalResources</code>) for the specified controller by its name. Then - call it in <code>BaseController</code>, add it to <code>ViewData</code> and render it in <code>Layout</code>.</p>

<p>Would that be a good idea?</p>
","70393","","<p>If you insist on keeping it separate, you could do something like:</p>

<pre><code>//keep all of your localised vars somewhere
var title = '{title_from_server}';
document.getElementById('someImage').title = title;
</code></pre>

<p>Remember, if you use JavaScript code to initialize any text of elements, your site will degrade horribly where JavaScript isn't available.</p>

"<p>Hi out there in Stackland!  Here's my problem:</p>

<p>I want to use my Zend controller to load an array from a database, and then pass it to javascript.  I've decided the best way to do this is to use ajax to ask the controller for it's array, encode it in json, and then pass it down.  However, I don't know how to pass the variable I loaded in my first action to the action that will pass it down when it gets called via ajax.</p>

<p>The original action which produces the view</p>

<pre><code>public function indexAction()
    {
            $storeid = $this-&gt;getStoreId();

            if(!$storeid)
            {
                 $this-&gt;_forward('notfound');
                 return;
            }

            $store = $this-&gt;_helper-&gt;loadModel('stores');
            $store-&gt;getByPrimary($storeid);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>The action that will be called via ajax</p>

<pre><code>public function getdataAction()
        {
            $this-&gt;_helper-&gt;Layout-&gt;disableLayout(); // Will not load the layout
            $this-&gt;_helper-&gt;viewRenderer-&gt;setNoRender(); //Will not render view

            $jsonResponse = json_encode($store);
            $this-&gt;getResponse()-&gt;setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json')
                                -&gt;setBody($jsonResponse);

        }
</code></pre>

<p>What I want is to pass $store in indexAction to getdataAction so it can send store as the jsonResponse.  Note, these are called at two different times.  </p>

<p>Things I have tried that haven't worked:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>setting $this->getRequest()->setParam('store', $store) in indexAction, and then using $this->getRequest()->getParam('store'), in getdataAction.  I presume this hasn't worked because they're different http requests, so attaching a new param is useless.</p></li>
<li><p>using protected $_store in the controller itself, and then saving to it with indexAction, and using it in getdataAction.  I'm not really sure why this isn't working.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Is there a good way to pass a variable in this manner?  Is there a way to pass a variable between different controllers?(I assume the answer to one is the answer to the other).  Could I store it in a controller helper?  Do I have to use a session, which I know would work but seems unnecessary?  Is there a better way to pass variables to javascript?  Am I asking too many questions?  Any help would be outstanding.  Thanks.  </p>
","70393","","<p>It would be better architecture to simply add a method to your IndexController, a helper, or somewhere, that returns an instance of Store. Use that method within your indexAction, and your getdataAction (would be more meaningful to call it ajaxAction).

        {
             $this-&gt;_forward('notfound');
             return;

        $store = $this-&gt;_helper-&gt;loadModel('stores');

        return $store;
    }

    {
        $this-&gt;_helper-&gt;Layout-&gt;disableLayout(); // Will not load the layout
        $this-&gt;_helper-&gt;viewRenderer-&gt;setNoRender(); //Will not render view

        $jsonResponse = json_encode($this-&gt;getStore());
        $this-&gt;getResponse()-&gt;setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json')
                            -&gt;setBody($jsonResponse)

"<p>Scriptaculous's Effect.Morph can take a CSS class and apply it over a period of time.  I have a div which expands when a button is clicked, so it uses Effect.Morph to apply an <code>.expanded</code> class.</p>

<p>So you would need to call it again, specifying the initial CSS properties so your div can revert back to its initial state, for example (again, from the docs):</p>

&lt;/ul&gt;

<p>Alternatively, you could use Prototype to <a href=""http://www.prototypejs.org/api/element/removeClassName"" rel=""nofollow"">remove the class altogether</a>:</p>

"<p>We recently built a web app using Prototype, making a fair amount of use of its Class.Create() functionality. Right now, we're considering migrating to jQuery as it seems to be considered a 'better' library. I've been doing some reading on the topic and found out that jQuery does not have straightforward built-in support for class-creation like Prototype does. Of course, there's still the .prototype and the jQuery.extend (as mentioned in <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/79477/how-to-create-an-object-oriented-class-in-jquery"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/79477/how-to-create-an-object-oriented-class-in-jquery</a>), but after some more searching, I got the feeling that jQuery doesn't really 'want' you to script this way...</p>

<p>The same page has a post mentioning John Resig's Classy plugin, which looked great to me. However, the page states that it was actually an April Fools Day joke, and that Resig actually advises not to use the code. I'm happy to oblige, but I'd like to understand what the reason for all this is, and, of course, what it is they DO want you to do instead. Can someone enlighten me?</p>

<p>-edit-</p>

<p>Thanks for the interesting answers. For the sake of clarity: does this mean it is fine to rewrite the classes I made in Prototype to the jQuery way of 'shaping' a class, and still use them in the same 'manner' as before? Or is this still considered bad practice, and should I use a different approach?</p>

<p>Also, if the page is rendered incrementally your function call might execute as it has been ouput, and before the DOM has been fully loaded by the browser and thus behave unpredictably (or just not work at all - I've had this happen).</p>

  <p>Domain means data domain here. That is
  a <code>DomainException</code> shall be through
  whenever a value does not adhere to a

  <ul>
  <li>0 is not a in the domain for division.</li>
  <li>Foo is not in the domain for weekdays.</li>

  <code>InvalidParameter</code> in case it is
  actually a parameter to the function

"<p>I am working on a database program using PHP to keep track of the products we manage at my workplace.</p>

<p>For this project, I need to be able to select an .XLS file which contains new product data.
New data consists of the following fields:</p>

<p>Type CHAR(3), 
  Line CHAR(2), 
  Number INT, 
  Measure INT, 
  Comments VARCHAR(255), 
  Variation CHAR(1) i.e.('Y' || 'N')</p>

<p>These files are created in Excel, or Google Docs; I have found a <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/php-excel-reader/"" rel=""nofollow"">wonderful excel_reader</a> which allows me to extract the values from this file.</p>

<p>As this is an action which will happen routinely, as new products are created, so I do not want the file to be stored in my server directory (after a while there would be dozens!). 
I would rather that the file simply be read, because the import script I'm writing transfers the file's data into an array.</p>

<p>What I really want to happen is to have the user select the file's location (on their local computer) through an HTML form, and then have the script save that file's contents to a MySQL database without ever sending the file to the Server. </p>

<p>As a last point, I would be a little worried about <em>immediate</em> deletion of uploaded files.

In short, the page contains a search text box at the top right, on <code>document.ready</code> I simply call an inputHint() function that adds the phrase ""search products"" to my textbox. When the user clicks this textbox, I call another function (hideHint() in this case) to hide the default ""search products"" phrase. Finally if the user leaves the text without typing and clicks anywhere else on the page, I reshow the hint again. Here's a piece of the javascript userd: <br /></p>

<pre><code>$.fn.inputHint = function(options) {
	options = $.extend({hintClass: 'hint'}, options || {});

	function showHint() {			
		if ($(this).val() == '') {

"<p>I have a quick, beginners-type-question. If I were to use jQuery and some other framework, would the following statement be problematic:</p>

        $(""input[value='login']"").attr(""checked"", ""checked"");

","70393","","<p>Yes, if you're using another library that uses $, you could use the full form jQuery or set up jQuery in <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Using%5FjQuery%5Fwith%5FOther%5FLibraries"" rel=""nofollow"">no-conflict mode</a>. E.g.:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;

       jQuery(""div"").hide();
     });

     // Use Prototype with $(...), etc.
     $('someid').hide();
   &lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Another way to benefit from a short name while preventing conflicts with other libraries would be to do somthing like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;
     var $j = jQuery.noConflict();

     // Use jQuery via $j(...)
     $j(document).ready(function(){

","70393","","<p>Your form loses its binding to the DOM after it is reloaded via ajax, so event handlers previously bound to the elements that get injected into the page are lost. </p>

"<p>I just graduated with an M.S. in computer science.  I did not have a background in CS before I started the program.  Unfortunately, halfway through my degree, I decided I did not want to be a developer and skimped on all software-engineering and development courses in order to take more math classes that would help me out with my new career goals.</p>

<p>Good news: I got a job in the new field I wanted my career in.</p>

<p>Bad news: After 3 happy months, they decided to stick me on this huge software development project with one other developer.  Neither of us have any experience developing and distributing software on a large-scale.    </p>

<p>We have ""succeeded"" in getting a prototype working, but in reality, we are the only two people who actually know how to run the program.  The amount of ""special"" knowledge required to get the program to run as expected is enormous.  Every time we are asked to test a new scenario (this is a microsimulation model), we have to make major programming changes because the model was not designed to handle that scenario.  When we finally get that scenario working, the requirements change again.</p>

<p>I really really want this project to succeed, but I am getting really really nervous, as both of my bosses (who also don't really have experience leading software projects or managing software development on this scale) expect this program to be distributed for company wide use very soon.</p>

<p>Problem is, I've made a few suggestions for how to improve the development process (slow things down and test), but they never seem to go anywhere.  The response is always that we are on tight deadline and we just need to keep going going going.  My nightmare is the day when we decide the model is working and that we need to distribute it.  Things are going to go wrong when users input a set of assumptions that model can't handle or use a starting dataset with characteristices different than we expect.  Then, I think, it will be my ass on the line.</p>

<p>Any advice?  I'm scared to make suggestions or suggest that the project is failing under the current conditions, but I'm also scared about what will happen if I don't speak up.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

I have general ideas for how we need to go about changing our ways, but I don't think I'm experienced enough myself to implement them.</p>
","70393","","<p>You need to speak up now! Tell your boss the solution is not a 'general' enough one to ship (explaining why), and that you need more time (and possibly more resources) to make it happen.</p>

<p>As irritable as he gets, he is responsible for the project, and if failure is not an option he will <em>have</em> to intervene in a helpful way, throwing you out of the company is highly unlikely.</p>

"<p>We all know that refactoring is good and I love it as much as the next guy, but do you have real cases where is better <em>not</em> to refactor ? </p>

<p>Something like time critical stuff or synchronization? Technical or human reasons are equally welcome. Real cases scenarios and experiences a plus.</p>

<p><em>Edit</em> : from the answers thus far, it looks like the only reason not to refactor is money.

"<p>I'm running into a bit of an issue when I try to return a link to pull up a thickbox on my page from a simple php echo. Basically what I have is:</p>

<p>A page with a few include statements like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php 
    include (""display_header.php"");
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Each one of the include statements just points to a php file that pulls a short query and echos out a link with an anchor ref to open an inline thickbox (with a form) when the user clicks on the link text like:</p>

<pre><code>echo ""&lt;a href='#TB_inline?height=265&amp;width=225&amp;inlineId=header_change' class='thickbox' style='text-decoration:none; color:#990000'&gt;"";
echo ""Query Result etc"";
echo ""&lt;/a&gt;"";
</code></pre>

<p>So when the user clicks on the link on the page, a thickbox with a form is supposed to pop up. The user enters their changes to the given section, clicks submit, and jquery ajax posts the form and reloads the div with the include statement to display the changes. </p>

<p>This works the first time the page is loaded, but once I submit the form and try to click on the returned link again nothing happens. This seems to work if I have the link surround the div with the include statement inside (which isn't a big deal to do), but I just don't understand why this doesn't work if I have the link in the included php statement.</p>

<p>Can anyone offer some guidance? I know there are a lot of brilliant people here and I'm probably just not understanding something very basic. Thanks!</p>
","70393","","<p>You need to bind thickbox to your links using <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Events/live"" rel=""nofollow"">Events/live</a>. Something like:</p>

<pre><code>$(""a.thickbox"").live(""click"",function() {
    tb_init('a.thickbox');
});
</code></pre>

<p>That will prevent your thickbox enabled links from losing their binding to thickbox after they are reloaded or injected via ajax.</p>

<p>You can also do it in the callback to your $.ajax (or $.post or whatever) method, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>$.ajax({
    type:       ""GET"",

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string</a></p>

<p>On your question about error handling, one way is to check the response text for something and act accordingly, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>$.ajax({
   type: ""POST"",
   url: ""delete.php"",
   data: string,
   cache: false,
   success: function(resp){
    if(resp == 'error') { //get PHP to echo the string 'error' if something bad happened
        alert('There was an error!');
    } else {
        commentContainer.slideUp('slow', function() {
            $(this).remove();
        });
        $('#load').fadeOut();   
    }
   }

"<p>It is common knowledge now to combine stylesheets and scripts in effort to reduce HTTP Requests. I have 2 questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>How expensive are they, really? </li>
<li>When is a request too big it should be split?</li>
</ol>

<p>I cannot find the answers to these two questions in all online readings I did, such as <a href=""http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html"">Yahoo! Best Practices</a> which states a number of times that HTTP requests are expensive, but never cite why or how.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
","70393","","<ol>
<li>Whenever a request is made, it is subjected to the harsh realities of network reliability. Two requests made in rapid succession from the same location might take entirely different routes, so with each request you're adding an element of unpredictability in terms of performance. A single consolidated request can help to mitigate that risk. @Dan McG wrote a sound point about the TCP handshake overhead.</li>
<li>HTTP does not care about request
size, as it serves as an application layer protocol on the IP (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet%5FProtocol%5FSuite"" rel=""nofollow"">Internet Protocol Suite</a>) stack. That is for TCP/IP to worry
about, what would be of concern to the publisher is keeping document/file sizes as small as possible, and small enough that their application is performant enough.</li>

"<p>I am sure there is a simple answer to this, but I am drawing a blank at the moment, any suggestions pointers would be great.</p>

<p>I have a php page [ lets say counter.php] which when called [loaded/viewed] it connects to a db and increments a counter.
I also have another page that has a selects box, I want to add a .js function on the onchange event that will call/poll the counter.php file thus incrementing the counter.</p>

<p>Is there a way to call or poll and file/page from .js, i know that this can be done via a HttpRequest but this seems like overkill as i don't want to return anything or change anything on the page.</p>

// connect to db
// increment counter val
// DOES NOT RETURN ANYTHING

increment()

    // I Just need to poll the page [counter.php] here,

","70393","","<p>Here is all I could think of in one sitting, forgive me if there are any glaring omissions.</p>

<p>Advantages to using PHP's built-in mail function, no external library/wrapper:</p>

<ul>
<li>You don't need anything outside of
PHP.</li>
<li>You don't need to learn a new API.</li>
<li>You don't have to worry about a PHP
upgrade or such breaking the script.</li>
<li>You don't have to worry about an
updated version not working on your
PHP installation.</li>
<li>You don't have to worry about
potential security vulnerabilities as
a result of using that script.</li>
<li>If it's a simple task, you'll be done
in a few minutes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Advantages to using an external library/wrapper:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you need to introduce more
complexity into your emailing, you
can do so quite easily. Adding
attachments, inline images and such
are not much fun using PHP plain mail
function. External libraries (at
least the good ones) have a more
OOPish API. Adding an attachment can be as easy as <code>$message-&gt;addAttachment($file);</code> without having to play around with headers, etc.</li>
<li>External libraries better hide the
ugly complexities of tasks such as
adding attachments, character
encodings and inline images.</li>
<li>Using a library now will save you the
hassle of having to learn it in the
future when you <em>do</em> need the
additional complexity/functionality.</li>
<li>External libraries <em>probably</em> (I'm
really not sure which ones, and to
what extent) address certain
vulnerabilities that PHP's mail does
not.</li>
</ul>

<p>If I can think of anything else, I'll be sure to add it.</p>

"<p>I'm working with a legacy code that someone had left, and it happens to be my task to re-deploy the code. I'm using Windows Server 2003, Apache 2.0.63 and PHP 5.2.10.</p>

<p>It doesn't work. At least, not in the way I had expected it to work. Call it bugs, if you will.</p>

<p>Upon inspecting, I had a suspicion that this code (which appears numerous times in the application) is the culprit.</p>

    &lt;?php

<pre>
    &lt;?
       phpinfo();
       //$variable = &$this->request;
    ?>
</pre>

<p>The code misbehaves, and produce this result on the screen instead, which of course, totally unwanted and unexpected.</p>

<pre>
    request; ?>
</pre>

<p>Now, the code is littered with the similar code as above, and as such, the application now produce output on the screen similar to this one: </p>

<pre>
    request; $user = &$this->user; // This is comment return false; ?>
</pre>

<p>for a code that reads as:</p>

<pre>
    &lt;?
        $request = &$this->request;
        $user = &$this->user;
        // This is comment
        return false;
    ?>  
</pre>

<p>I had tried to change every &lt;? with &lt;?php whenever &amp;$this-> rears its ugly head, but most of the time, it introduces a new error instead.</p>

<p>I reinstalled PHP and Apache, even using another version of PHP (5.2.6) and it still won't work. I deployed the code in my localhost (Mac OS X, PHP 5.2.8 and Apache 2.0.63) and it worked without a hassle.</p>

","70393","","<p>If you stick to pure non-proprietary (ANSI) SQL you won't have to modify any queries. An example of where you might be using proprietary extensions is in pagination. If you're doing any pagination within your web application it is highly likely that you're using something like this:</p>

<pre><code>select id, name, created from thing limit(0,20)
</code></pre>

<p>That query won't work on Oracle, as <a href=""http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/select.html"" rel=""nofollow"">limit</a> is a proprietary extension to MySql, you would have to go about pagination using Oracle's <a href=""http://www.oracle.com/technology/oramag/oracle/06-sep/o56asktom.html"" rel=""nofollow"">rownum</a> (which can only take one argument), so essentially you will have to rewrite your pagination queries to look like this:</p>

<pre><code>select * 
  from ( select /*+ FIRST_ROWS(n) */ 
  a.*, ROWNUM rnum 
      from ( your_query_goes_here, 
      with order by ) a 
      where ROWNUM &lt;= 
      :MAX_ROW_TO_FETCH ) 
where rnum  &gt;= :MIN_ROW_TO_FETCH;
</code></pre>

<p>Also consider that you'll be using one of the Oracle extensions, so your database connection, manipulation and error handling code will have to be rewritten too 
(<a href=""http://www.orafaq.com/wiki/PHP%5FFAQ#What%5Fis%5FPHP%5Fand%5Fwhat.27s%5Fit%5Fgot%5Fto%5Fdo%5Fwith%5FOracle.3F"" rel=""nofollow"">example from the oci8 extension docs</a>) and will look more like:</p>

<pre><code>if ($c = oci_connect(""hr"", ""hr_password"", ""localhost/XE"")) {
   echo ""Successfully connected to Oracle."";
   oci_close($c);
 } else {
   $err = oci_error();
   echo ""Oracle Connect Error "" . $err['text'];
 }
   // Select Data...
   $s = oci_parse($c, ""select * from tab1"");
   oci_execute($s, OCI_DEFAULT);
   while (oci_fetch($s)) {
     echo ""COL1 = "" . oci_result($s, ""COL1"") .
        "", COL2 = "" . oci_result($s, ""COL2"") . ""&lt;br&gt;\n"";
   }
</code></pre>

<p>So as you can see it is no trivial feat, especially not if you have tons of MySql-hardwired code.</p>

<p>If the portability of your application is a major concern you should seriously consider using a library that allows you to abstract out the database vendor altogether.

","70393","","<p>You need to put an empty array as the third argument to the join method, also the join condition should not be part of the first argument's array, but as the second argument instead (you'll notice that there is not join condition in your query).

","70393","","<p>First of all, you need to fix readCookie, your call to split will return everything after ""State="", which will be stored in the first offset of the returned array, so instead do this:</p>

"<p>Is there a way to easily handle manipulating URLs in JavaScript?</p>

<p><b>A bit of context:</b></p>

<p>I want to use ThickBox, the popular jQuery modal popup box, but unobtrusively. According to the ThickBox documentation I have to give all links that I want to be made modal a CSS class of ""thickbox"" and change the URL from...</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.mysite.com/mypopup"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mysite.com/mypopup</a></p>

<p>...to:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.mysite.com/mypopup?height=200&amp;width=300"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mysite.com/mypopup?height=200&amp;width=300</a></p>

<p>I want to make this happen only if JavaScript is enabled.</p>

<p>So I get all links using jQuery and ""hack"" a detect for the '?' character in the URL, appending ""&amp;height..."" or ""?height..."" accordingly.</p>

<p>In the grander scheme of things, this might muddle stuff up if the URL already has a ""height"" parameter, in which case I might just want to update the existing one as opposed to give it two.</p>

<p>It all smells a little.</p>

<p>I feel like I'm hacking code that can/must have been done properly once already!</p>

<p><b>So my question is:</b></p>

<p>Is there something in the JavaScript world (plugin or not) that would enable me to something like this:</p>

<pre><code>var url = Url(elm.attr(""href""));
url.parameter(""width"", ""300"");
url.parameter(""height"", ""200"");
elm.attr(""href"", url.toString())
</code></pre>

<p>Or:</p>

<pre><code>var height = Url(elm.attr(""href"")).parameter(""height"");
</code></pre>
","70393","","<p>This function does that, just call it on the page of the URL you want to parse:</p>

<pre><code>function gup( name )
{
  name = name.replace(/[\[]/,""\\\["").replace(/[\]]/,""\\\]"");
  var regexS = ""[\\?&amp;]""+name+""=([^&amp;#]*)"";
  var regex = new RegExp( regexS );
  var results = regex.exec( window.location.href );
  if( results == null )
    return """";
  else
    return results[1];
}

//for the URL http://www.mysite.com/mypopup?height=200&amp;width=300

var height = gup( 'height' );
var width = gup('width');
alert('Height: ' + height + ' Width: ' + width);

</code></pre>
","70393","","<p>InnerHTML should be innerHTML:</p>

<pre><code>document.getElementById('LblAboutMeCount').innerHTML = charsleft;

<p>You should bind your <code>checkLength</code> function to your textarea with jQuery rather than calling it inline and rather intrusively:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function() {
    $('textarea[name=text]').keypress(function(e) {
        checkLength($(this),512,$('#LblTextCount'));
    }).focus(function() {
        checkLength($(this),512,$('#LblTextCount'));
    });
});

<p>You can neaten up checkLength by using more jQuery, and I wouldn't use 'object' as a formal parameter:</p>

<pre><code>function checkLength(obj, maxlength, label) {
    charsleft = (maxlength - obj.val().length);
    // never allow to exceed the specified limit
    if( charsleft &lt; 0 ) {

    }
    // I'm trying to set the value of charsleft into the label
    label.text(charsleft);
    $('#LblAboutMeCount').html(charsleft);

<p>as you are selecting a direct descendant of an element reference by an id, so the selection is pretty direct.</p>

<p>EDIT: @redsquare has pointed out that the above will not work in Firefox and Chrome as those browsers will append a tbody element to tables.</p>

<p>Context selectors are basically converted into 'finds', so the slowest of the first two is:</p>

<p>as it is converted into something like this <em>before</em> any selection takes place:</p>

<p>How do you check if there is an attribute on an element in jQuery? Similar to <code>hasClass</code>, but with <code>attr</code>?</p>

<p>For example, </p>

<pre><code>if ($(this).hasAttr(""name"")) {
    // ...
}

","70393","","<p>If you will be checking the existence of attributes frequently, I would suggest creating a <code>hasAttr</code> function, to use as you hypothesized in your question:</p>

<pre><code>$.fn.hasAttr = function(name) {  
   return this.attr(name) !== undefined;
};

$(document).ready(function() {
    if($('.edit').hasAttr('id')) {
        alert('true');
    } else {

    }

"<p>I have some simple tables (multiple, all with class=""parent"") with multiple <code>&lt;tr&gt; </code>rows. The <code>&lt;td&gt;</code> cells within these rows have tables of their own. I'm trying to target the <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code> rows of the <em>first</em> (parent) tables, like so:</p>

<p>HTML:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;table class=""parent""&gt; 
  &lt;tr&gt; &lt;-- match with :first 
    &lt;td&gt; 
      &lt;table&gt; 
        &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; 
        &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

    &lt;/td&gt; 
  &lt;/tr&gt; 
  &lt;tr&gt; &lt;-- match with :last 
    &lt;td&gt; 
      &lt;table&gt; &lt;-- so ignore this child ..
        &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; 
        &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; &lt;-- .. and do NOT match this &lt;tr&gt; with :last 
      &lt;/table&gt; 
    &lt;/td&gt; 
  &lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;/table&gt;</code></pre>

<p>jQuery:</p>

<pre><code>$('table.parent').each(function() { 
  $(this).find('tr:first').dostuff(); 
  $(this).find('tr:last').dostuff(); 
});</code></pre>

<p>The <code>:first &lt;tr&gt;</code> works fine, since that's always the <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code> of the parent. But when I try to select the <code>:last &lt;tr&gt;</code>, it'll match the last <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code> of the nested table, and not the last <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code> of the parent table. How can I tell jQuery to only look at the <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code>s that are in the parent table, and don't search any further in possible children tables?</p>
","70393","","<p>I would suggest modifying your selector slightly to ensure that it works on browsers that append a <code>&lt;tbody&gt;</code> to tables (like Firefox and Chrome):</p>

<pre><code>//tested
$('table.parent &gt; tbody').each(function() {
   $(this).children('tr:first').text('hello').css('background-color', 'red');
   $(this).children('tr:last').text('hello').css('background-color', 'red');

<p>Where it gets tricky is the logic needed to determine which radio buttons to display and which to enable. A user must select one choice from each group, but cannot repeat the same choice from one group to another.</p>

<p>Ideally when the user gets to the page, all of the radio buttons would be available but unselected.</p>

<p>If the user were to first select (for example) Choice Two in Group Three, the script should then disable Choice Two in both Group One and Group Two. If the user then selects Choice Three in Group Two, it should then only enable Choice One in Group One, and so on.</p>

<p>Any help would be very, very much appreciated. I would post the jQuery I've been attempting to write to solve this problem but I don't think I've been going about this very well and would love any help working through it.  Thanks!</p>

       if($(this).is(':checked')) {
           var val = $(this).val();
           //disable all the ones with the same value
           $('input:radio').each(function() {

","70393","","<p>Pretty way (from <a href=""http://www.evaragroup.com/mailer/docs/extending.html"">this link</a>), first extend PHPMailer and set the defaults for your site :</p>

class my_phpmailer extends phpmailer {
    // Set default variables for all new objects
    var $From     = ""from@example.com"";
    var $FromName = ""Mailer"";
    var $Host     = ""smtp1.example.com;smtp2.example.com"";
    var $Mailer   = ""smtp"";                         // Alternative to IsSMTP()
    var $WordWrap = 75;

    // Replace the default error_handler
    function error_handler($msg) {
        print(""My Site Error"");
        print(""Description:"");
        printf(""%s"", $msg);
        exit;
    }

    // Create an additional function
    function do_something($something) {
        // Place your new code here
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then include the above script where needed (in this example it is named <code>mail.inc.php</code>) and use your newly created <code>my_phpmailer</code> class somewhere on your site:</p>

<pre><code>require(""mail.inc.php"");//or the name of the first script

// Instantiate your new class
$mail = new my_phpmailer;

// Now you only need to add the necessary stuff
$mail-&gt;AddAddress(""josh@example.com"", ""Josh Adams"");
$mail-&gt;Subject = ""Here is the subject"";
$mail-&gt;Body    = ""This is the message body"";
$mail-&gt;AddAttachment(""c:/temp/11-10-00.zip"", ""new_name.zip"");  // optional name

if(!$mail-&gt;Send())
{
   echo ""There was an error sending the message"";

"<p>Greetings,</p>

<p>I have some mysql tables that are currently using an md5 hash as a primary key. I normally generate the hash with the value of a column. For instante, let's imagine I have a table called ""Artists"" with the fields id, name, num_members, year. I tend to make a md5($name) and use it has an ID.</p>

<p>I would like to know what are the downsides of doing this. Is it just better to use integers with AUTO_INCREMENT ? I tend to run away from this because it's just not worth the trouble of finding out what the last id inserted was, and what will be the next etc.</p>

<p>Can you give me some lights on this?</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
","70393","","<p>The first approach has one obvious disadvantage: if there are two artists of the same name there will be a primary key collision. Using an INT column with an auto-increment will ensure uniqueness.</p>

<p>Furthermore, though very unlikely, there is a chance that MD5 hashes of <em>different</em> strings could collide (I seem to recall the probability as being 1 in 36 to the power of 32).</p>

"<p>I'm working on an Active Record pattern (similar to RoR/Cake) for my Zend Framework library. My question is this: How do I figure out whether a select object is using an alias for a table or not? </p>

<pre><code>$select-&gt;from(array(""c"" =&gt; ""categories""));
</code></pre>

<p><strong>vs.</strong></p>

<pre><code>$select-&gt;from(""categories"");
</code></pre>

<p>and I pass this to a ""fetch"" function which adds additional joins and whatnot to get the row relationships automatically...I want to add some custom sql; either ""c.id"" or ""categories.id"" based on how the user used the ""from"" method.</p>

<p>I know I can use </p>

<pre><code>$parts = $select-&gt;getPart(Zend_Db_Select::FROM);
</code></pre>

<p>to get the from data as an array, and the table name or alias seems to be in ""slot"" 0 of said array. Will the table name or alias always be in slot zero? i.e. can I reliably use:</p>

<pre><code>$tableNameOrAlias = $parts[0];
</code></pre>

<p>Sorry if this is convolute but hope you can help! :)</p>
","70393","","<p>Logically, I would think that's how it should work. To be on the safe side, build a few dummy queries using a Select() and dump the part array using <code>print_r</code> or such.</p>

<p>I just performed this test, the alias is the array key, it is not a zero-based numeric array:</p>

<pre><code>   $select = $this-&gt;db-&gt;select()-&gt;from(array(""c"" =&gt; ""categories"",""d"" =&gt; ""dummies""));
   $parts = $select-&gt;getPart(Zend_Db_Select::FROM);
   echo '&lt;pre&gt;';
   print_r($parts);
   echo '&lt;/pre&gt;';
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code>Array
(
    [c] =&gt; Array
        (
            [joinType] =&gt; inner join
            [schema] =&gt; 
            [tableName] =&gt; categories
            [joinCondition] =&gt; 
        )

)

"<p>Fellow JQuery hackers, hello :-)</p>

<p>Suppose you have the following code:</p>

<pre><code>$('.links').click(function(){
    //Do something
}
</code></pre>

<p>And I then insert dynamic content into a DIV's HTML content (Say, for example, after clicking a button, the new content gets inserted). This content has the ""links"" class. The problem is that the ""click"" button doesn't get registered with the newly inserted content.</p>

<p><strong>How do I tell JQuery to re-select all the elements with a ""links"" class and apply the above function on them? Can this be automated?</strong></p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
","70393","","<p>You'll want to use event delegation:</p>

<pre><code>$('.links').live(""click"",function(){
    //Do something
});
</code></pre>

<p>That will prevent dynamically inserted elements with the class <code>links</code> from losing their click event handler. Note that you will also need <strong>jQuery 1.3 or later</strong> for that to work.
See <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Events/live"" rel=""nofollow"">Events/live</a>.</p>

<p>Another way is to re-bind using the callback of whichever of jQuery's <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Ajax"" rel=""nofollow"">ajax</a> methods you have opted to use, example:</p>

<pre><code>$('#someDiv').load('page.html', function() {
    $('.links').click(function(){
        //Do something
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>or neater still:</p>

<pre><code>function initLinks() {
    $('.links').click(function(){
        //Do something
    }
}

$('#someDiv').load('page.html',initLinks);

<p>That will replace the contents of div id=""myDiv"" with your loading indicator, and then inject the output of Client/GetStuff into it.</p>

What I am actually trying to accomplish is to use the abovementioned function as a callback for the Uploadify jquery plugin (<a href=""http://www.uploadify.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.uploadify.com</a>).</p>

<p>Here is the full javascript code:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function() {

        'uploader'       : '/flash-uploader/scripts/uploadify.swf',
        'script'         : '/flash-uploader/scripts/upload-public-photo.php',

        'scriptData'     : {'user_id' : 'USER_ID'},
        'queueID'        : 'fileQueue',
        'auto'           : true,

    });
});

<p>I have tried both text() and html(), also alert(). Still nothing :(</p>

<h2>EDIT2:</h2>

<p>Upon further research I have found out that a default onComplete() function in the Uploadify plugin looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>jQuery(this).bind(""uploadifyComplete"", {'action': settings.onComplete}, function(event, ID, fileObj, response, data) {
    if (event.data.action(event, ID, fileObj, unescape(response), data) !== false) {
        jQuery(""#"" + jQuery(this).attr('id') + ID + "" .percentage"").text(' - Completed');
        jQuery(""#"" + jQuery(this).attr('id') + ID).fadeOut(250, function() { jQuery(this).remove()});
    }
});

"<p>I could really use an example of this. Can anyone provide me with a sample implementation of a Javascript function using JQuery (not totally necessary) to make a Castle Monorail call?</p>

<p>I have Monorail configured to intercept all HttpRequests with ""*.ashx"". Using an Ajax call I would like to pass a parameter to my Monorail Controller and get back a string.</p>

<p>Can someone give me some pseudo code or point me in the right direction?</p>

"<p>When I want to prevent other event handlers from executing after a certain event is fired, I can use one of two techniques. I'll use jQuery in the examples, but this applies to plain-JS as well:</p>

<h3>#<code>1 event.preventDefault()</code></h3>

<pre><code>$('a').click(function (e) {
    // custom handling here
    e.preventDefault();
});
</code></pre>

<h3>#<code>2 return false</code></h3>

<pre><code>$('a').click(function () {
    // custom handling here
    return false;
});
</code></pre>

<p>Is there any significant difference between those two methods of stopping event propagation?</p>

<p>For me, <code>return false;</code> is simpler, shorter and probably less error prone than executing a method. With the method, you have to remember about correct casing, parenthesis, etc. </p>

<p>Also, I have to define the first parameter in callback to be able to call the method. Perhaps, there are some reasons why I should avoid doing it like this and use <code>preventDefault</code> instead? What's the better way?</p>
","70393","","<p><code>return false</code> from <em>within a jQuery event handler</em> is effectively the same as calling both  <code>e.preventDefault</code> and <code>e.stopPropagation</code> on the passed <a href=""http://api.jquery.com/category/events/event-object/"">jQuery.Event object.</a></p>

<p><code>e.preventDefault()</code> will prevent the default event from occuring, <code>e.stopPropagation()</code> will prevent the event from bubbling up and <code>return false</code> will do both. Note that this behaviour differs from <em>normal</em> (non-jQuery) event handlers, in which, notably, <code>return false</code> <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/APQk6/"">does <em>not</em> stop the event from bubbling up</a>.</p>

","70393","","<p>I implemented something like that, however, my implementation makes use of <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Autocomplete"" rel=""nofollow"">jQuery UI Autocomplete</a>. </p>

<p>I use a simple trick, whereby the data returned from the server is a set of strings separated by a newline character ""\n"", on each line there is a string with the format <strong>suggestion::url</strong>. On the client, I simply split at the separator (I use <strong>::</strong>) and extract the suggestion from the first offset of the resulting array, and the URL from the second. Example:</p>

<pre><code>    $(""#search"").autocomplete(""/some/page"", {
        selectFirst: false,
        formatItem: function(data, i, n, value) {
            //make the suggestion look nice
            return ""&lt;font color='#3399CC'&gt;"" + value.split(""::"")[0] + ""&lt;/font&gt;"";
        },
        formatResult: function(data,value) {
            //only show the suggestions and not the URLs in the list
            return value.split(""::"")[0];

        var pieces = formatted.split(""::"");
        window.location.href = pieces[1];
    });

<p>To clarify what I mean, suppose you type 'goo'. The server might return:</p>

<pre><code>google::www.google.com\ngoodstuff::www.example.com
</code></pre>

<p>That user will see a list appear with 'google' and 'goodstuff'. Clicking on one of those will execute the <code>result</code> method of Autocomplete, where I simply take the URL part of the string and redirect. Hope that helps.</p>

"<p>Before I throw something ugly together I thought this would be a good one to ask the experts.</p>

<p>So I've got a button that a user can click that:</p>

<p>a) Passes a variable from the element to a jquery function and posts to a php script like so (this works fine, though there is probably an easier way):</p>

<pre><code>$("".complete_btn"").live(""click"", function(){
	var fooString= this.id;									
	var fooSplit= fooString.split(""-"");
	var fooId= fooSplit[1];

			type: ""POST"",
			url: ""http://localhost/foo/php/complete_foo.php"",
			data: ""fooId=""+fooId,
			success: function() {
				}
	   		});
})
</code></pre>

<p>b) The PHP script takes the variable, stips/trims/escapes/whatever, checks permissions, and unsets a session and creates a new one (also works fine):</p>

<pre><code>if(isset($_SESSION['foo_id']))
        			unset($_SESSION['foo_id']); 
        			session_start();
        			$_SESSION['foo_id'] = $foo_id_posted;
        			header (""Location: http://localhost/foo/reviewfoo.php"");

<p>The issue that I'm running into is that I can't just use a header to forward to my page since I'm posting this via ajax. Instead the function is pulling a <code>get</code> of the <a href=""http://localhost/foo/reviewfoo.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://localhost/foo/reviewfoo.php</a>, which doesn't do any good.</p>

<p>Can someone offer some guidance on what might be the best way to do this? I've got some sloppy ideas, but I'm hoping someone can give me an idea on what me be the RIGHT way to do this. </p>

","70393","","<p>Use event delegation with <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Events/live"" rel=""nofollow""><code>live</code></a>, as after you call <code>$.load</code> the newly injected elements will not have the click event handler bound to them:</p>

"<p>I'm having hard time trying to figure out how to <strong>auto-save user data</strong> in a form when the browser is being closed or user changes the page. The <strong>onBeforeUnload event</strong> is OK when you want to open a dialog box, but by then it's too late to save the changes (except if you just <strong>block the browser</strong> in the onBeforeUnload handler long enough for it to pass the request to the server...but I'd rather not do that).</p>

<p>I am sure some of you have had to deal with the unsaved form problem. What do you do? Do you:</p>

<ul>

<li>ask them using a <strong>modal window</strong> if they are sure they did the right thing, </li>
<li>save individual fields <strong>on the fly</strong> as they change, </li>

<p>I'm having to deal with a similar situation, and that's what we are doing. The two main things that sell that to me:</p>

<ol>
<li>Improved user experience - the user
will be impressed by a form that
does not lose changes. They are
'committed' <strong>once they are validated</strong>.
E.g., he types in a valid email
address, and it is saved instantly,
furthermore he is provided some sort
of feedback for each field that is
successfully been saved (a green
tick for example, appears next to
the field).</li>
<li>No more '<em>oh crap my browser crashed
and I lost all my info</em>' situations.</li>
</ol>

<p>Disadvantages: The extra man-hours involved in developing such a solution, and the possibly that it ends up not degrading as nicely as a simpler solution. That said, it is still worth it IMO.</p>

    // this is taken from the same page
    // I have tested this with alert() and yes
    // it is returning correct values
    var id = $('#media-photo img').attr('id');

        // with the resulting HTML from the submission page
        $('#add-media-comment').html(data);
    }, 'html');

<p>Id like it to return ""OK"" on success, and ""FAIL"" on failure.</p>
","70393","","<p>You shouldn't hard-code messages like ""OK"" and ""FAIL"" into a function as its possible return values, that's a bit scary in terms of localization <em>and</em> the flexibility of your application. You should return a boolean and deal with messages outside of that function.</p>

<p>It makes little sense to test the returned strings if you're calling that function from elsewhere in your application where you only care about the semantics of what has happened as opposed to the returned message. What if you decide to change 'FAIL!' to 'Unsuccessful' for example? You will end up having to change all the other code that relies upon the return of your function. Why not just do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>function InsertIntoDB($field1, $field2, $field3, $field4, $field5, $field6, $field7, $field8, $field9){
     $sql = ""INSERT INTO `caches` ( `url` ,  `username` ,  `password` ,  `cachename` ,  `lat` ,  `long` ,  `message` ,  `notes` ,  `tags`  ) VALUES(  '{$field1}' ,  '{$field2}' ,  '{$field3}' ,  '{$field4}' ,  '{$field5}' ,  '{$field6}' ,  '{$field7}' ,  '{$field8}' ,  '{$field9}'  ) "";

","70393","","<p>For completeness, you can use the <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Selectors/attributeStartsWith#attributevalue"">starts with</a> attribute filter:</p>

<pre><code>$('[id^=""control_""]').hide();

"<p>I am making a Wordpress plugin that provides updates in the widget section of the page - everything works fine.  The one thing that doesn't is the ajax callback (using load with jquery).  It appears that Wordpress is blocking direct access to the php file that I am trying to load (it is in /wp-content/plugins/myplugin).</p>

<p>How should I be doing this?</p>
","70393","","<p>Can you not make a proxy script in the root of your site to get the output of that script by simply including it? e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
include '/wp-content/plugins/myplugin.php';

"<p>If I have many settings that I want to store in a cookie, should I create multiple cookies with one option each, or one big cookie with multiple options in a serialized array or something?</p>

<p>Are there any pros/cons for either approach? What do most people do?</p>
","70393","","<p>A good reason to have separate cookies is so each one is independent of the others, that is to say, an individual cookie can then be expired without affecting other ones, which is <em>not</em> possible if you have everything stored in one big cookie.</p>

"<p>My site is pretty large and I do not use PHP Classes, I do not understand OO good enough yet to re-write my site to use them however I would really like to use the
__autoload($class_name) feature that classes use.  I rely a lot on functions, I have different function files,<br />
forums.inc.php<br />
blogs.inc.php<br />
user.inc.php<br />
photos.inc.php<br />
general.inc.php  </p>

<p>All these files are just functions specific to a certain part of the site, except general.inc.php would have functions that need to be on ever page.  </p>

<p>Now is there anyway I could use autoload or make something similar that would load these function files?  I once thought about doing it based on the URL, like if the URL had the word forums in it, I would load the forums function file but this would not always work as ever file related to forums does not have the word forum in there URL.  </p>

<p>Am I pretty much out of options until I learn to code OO good enough to put all my functions into classes?</p>

<pre><code>//example of the autoload 
function __autoload($class_name){
    include('classes/' . $class_name . '.class.php');
}
$time = new time();
$time-&gt;fn1();
</code></pre>
","70393","","<p>I don't think you can, to be honest, not in a straightforward way. In any case, wouldn't it be way nicer to use utility classes? There's nothing to the OOP, look at this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
    class HTMLUtil {

        public static function filter($str) {...}
        public static function entities($str) {...}
        public static function encode($str) {...}
        ...etc...
    }
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Static Helper/Utility classes that group together related functionality are simple to put together, just declare your functions as <a href=""http://us3.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.static.php""><code>static</code></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Declaring class members or methods as
  static makes them accessible without
  needing an instantiation of the class.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now you can use <code>__autoload</code>. You don't have to instantiate those classes to use any of their static functions, and it makes your code more readable (if slightly more verbose). I always find it more satisfying to do something like:</p>

<pre><code>echo HTMLUtil::filter($str);
</code></pre>

<p>instead of:</p>

<pre><code>echo filter($str); //scary filter function, where are you from?
</code></pre>

<p>If needed, you can also declare a private constructor in your utility classes to prevent them from being instantiated, to emphasize that their 'just a bunch of related functions':</p>

<pre><code>private __construct() {...}
</code></pre>

<p>To call a static function from another function within the same class you would do so using the <code>self</code> keyword (which references the same <em>class</em>, and not <em>object</em> or <em>class instance</em>):</p>

<pre><code>public static function foo()
{
    echo self::bar() . '..and some foo';
}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem seems to be the outermost while loop in step1(). It is supposed to keep running until all the condition are met but it just stops after one iteration and I can't figure out why. If I remove the outer while loop step1() proceeds exactly as it should going through each step on multiple presses of the button. Help!</p>
","70393","","<p>Maybe one of your up/down/left/right/left/leftinv etc. methods is modifying the background(s) you're testing the colours of, causing the while condition to evaluate to false thereby preventing more than 1 iteration.</p>

","70393","","<p>From what I can see, you're using the wrong function name in your call, the declared function is <code>showMessageBox</code> and you're calling <code>showMessage</code>. Also, you need to declare the function outside of the <code>document.ready</code> block, so it is available in the global context.</p>

<p>A function declared from one <code>document.ready</code> block cannot be accessed from other <code>document.ready</code> blocks, I've performed that test before. See this answer:</p>

"<p>I am getting a response from ajax request(done by jquery). </p>

<p>I have a method that displays errors to the users. Sometimes though I have some other information coming along with the json request.</p>

<p>So I don't want this info shown(where the rest of the errors are). So I figured since I always know the length of the json coming back I can just shorten the length since the error method just uses a while loop so if it is one less then it won't display that json part.</p>

<p>So I did this</p>

<pre><code>var length = result.length -1;

ErrorsMethod(result, length); // call function.

   function ErrorsMethod(result, length)
    {
       while( i &lt; length)
       { 
         // do stuff.
       }

<p>length.length
ParseInt(length);</p>

That's because you're replacing all those links via your ajax call, so after you click one, all of them get replaced and no longer have the <code>click</code> event handler binding.</p>

<p><code>jQuery.live</code> prevents them from losing their bound event handler(s), by automatically re-attaching the event handlers to newly injected elements matching your selector. See:</p>

<p><a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Events/live"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.jquery.com/Events/live</a></p>

<p>EDIT: try re-attaching the accordion within <code>$.load</code>'s callback:</p>

<pre><code>$(function(){
   $('#example').tabs({
      load: function(event, ui) {
          $("".products"", ui.panel).accordion();
          $("".product_link"", ui.panel).colorbox();

          $('a', ui.panel).live(""click"", function() {
              $(ui.panel).load(this.href, function() {
                  $("".products"", ui.panel).accordion();
                  $("".product_link"", ui.panel).colorbox();

","70393","","<p>For simple ajax calls, I normally prefer using <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Ajax/load"" rel=""nofollow"">$.load</a> as its grammar is extremely concise. Passing parameters as an object (key/value pairs) will cause it to use a POST request:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href=""no-script.php"" class=""something""&gt;Click!&lt;/a&gt;

$(document).ready(function() {
    $('a.something').click(function(e) {

        e.preventDefault();

        //inject div.classname with the output of send.php
        $('div.classname').load('send.php', {param1: 'foo', param2: 'blah'});
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>If you don't need it to be a POST, you can just add your parameters as a query string:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>Is it possible in PHP?</p>

"<p>Code for Showing Loading indicator while loading content in the inframe

"<p>I have a form with some select elements. One of them is configured so that if the user changes the value, the next input may get enabled or disabled, depending on the value. When changing the value with the mouse, everything works fine. However, when using the keyboard, strange things happen. It acts differently from one browser to another.</p>

<p>In Firefox, if I change the value to enable the next input, then press the tab key, the focus skips the input that was just enabled. I can focus it by pressing shift+tab, but I think that may be annoying and confusing to users.</p>

<p>In Chrome, if I change the value to enable the next input, then press tab, the focus jumps like in Firefox. If I change the value to disable the next input, then press tab, the next input gets focused despite being disabled. This is strange, but not a big deal because the user can press tab again and focus the input after it.</p>

<p>In Internet Explorer, something very strange happens: everything works fine! If I change the value to enable the next input, then press tab, the next input gets focused. If I change the value to disable the next input, then press tab, the focus skips the disabled input. It works in IE 6, 7, and 8.</p>

<p>I am doing the enabling and disabling with jQuery. I haven't had a chance to test it with plain Javascript so far.</p>

<p>You can test this issue with the following page:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN""
    ""http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd""&gt;
&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;
&lt;meta http-equiv='Content-Type' content='text/html; charset=UTF-8'&gt;
&lt;title&gt;select focus test&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;select id=""enabler""&gt;
    &lt;option value=""0"" selected&gt;Disabled
    &lt;option value=""1""&gt;Enabled
&lt;/select&gt;
&lt;select id=""target"" disabled&gt;
    &lt;option value=""a""&gt;a
    &lt;option value=""b""&gt;b
&lt;/select&gt;
&lt;select id=""next""&gt;
    &lt;option value=""x""&gt;x
    &lt;option value=""y""&gt;y
&lt;/select&gt;
&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""jquery-1.3.2.min.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
$(""#enabler"").change(function() {
    $enabler = $(this);
    $(""#target"").attr(""disabled"", $enabler.val() == ""0"");
});
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If you change the value of the first dropdown, then press tab, you can see the behavior.</p>

<p>Here is my question: Is there any way to make the form act in all browsers like it does in IE?</p>
","70393","","<p>I just tried your code, and managed to duplicate what you described. I tried to produce the desired behaviour by:</p>

<ul>
<li>explicitly setting tabindexes for the
drop-downs. (would be a good idea anyway)</li>
<li>closing your option tags (you really should be doing this)</li>
<li>enclosing your jQuery within a
$(document).ready block. (you really should be doing this too)</li>
</ul>

<p>None of the above did the trick, but here's a simple workaround to automatically focus the target element (tested in FF/Safari):</p>

<pre><code>   $(document).ready(function() {
         $(""#enabler"").change(function() {
            $enabler = $(this);
            $(""#target"").attr(""disabled"", $enabler.val() == ""0"")
                        .focus();
        });
   });

"<p>I'm trying to use jQuery to combine the user's select field choices (category + contributors) and insert this into a hidden field with an id of as_q, but when I run the script the value of as_q is always empty. </p>

","70393","","<p>In addition to the other suggestions made:</p>

<p>1 - Put your code into a <code>$(document).ready(...</code> block. This could be why it's not working.</p>

<p>2 - Give your selects IDs for better performance, <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Selectors"" rel=""nofollow"">attribute filters</a> (like [name=blah]) are not the snappiest way to select elements.</p>

"<p>Is it possible to obtain the id of an element (div, input etc) using jQuery and how?</p>
","70393","","<p>See <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Attributes/attr"" rel=""nofollow"">Attributes/attr</a></p>

<p>Simple example:</p>

<pre><code>alert($('div.someclass').attr('id'));
</code></pre>

<p>If there is more than one div with the class <code>someclass</code> (that is to say, the selector returns more than one element), you can get them all by looping through the elements using <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Utilities/jQuery.each"" rel=""nofollow"">each</a>, and pushing the ids into an array for example:</p>

<pre><code>var ids = [];
$('div.someclass').each(function() {
     ids.push($(this).attr('id'));
});
</code></pre>

<p>Just to go a little further, you can use <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Selectors"" rel=""nofollow"">attribute filters</a> (in this case <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Selectors/attributeHas#attribute"" rel=""nofollow""><code>attributeHas</code></a>) to pick out only those elements that have ids, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>var ids = [];
$('div[id]').each(function() {
     ids.push($(this).attr('id'));
});
</code></pre>

<p>and finally, instead of using each, you can use <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Traversing/map"" rel=""nofollow""><code>map( callback )</code></a> which provides a neater way of doing the above:</p>

<pre><code>var ids = $('div[id]').map(function(index, domElement) {

}).get();
alert(ids.join("",""));

"<p>I am looking for advice on a way to accomplish this. Given the following:</p>

<p>[Div A (contains an image)]<br>
[Div B (contains a horizontal list of 8 or so text links)]<br>
[Div C (contains text)]<br></p>

<p>Upon rolling over any link in Div B, how can I have Div A and Div C swap their respective contents out to something different that corresponds to the content of that link?</p>

<p>For example, if one were to rollover a Div B link called ""Dogs"", then upon that rollover, Div A would replace its contents and display an image of a dog and Div C would replace its contents and display text about dogs.</p>

<p>After rolling over that link, the new Div A and Div C contents will remain in place until a new link is rolled over.</p>

<p>I hope this makes sense. Does anyone have advice on the best way to accomplish this?</p>
","70393","","<p>Assuming the <code>href</code> points to one resource that contains the content for both, but you can't just inject the entire output of the link into one element, something like this could work:</p>

<pre><code>$('#divB a').mouseover(function() {

    //get images from link, inject into divA
    $('#divA').html('&lt;strong&gt;Loading...&lt;/strong&gt;')
              .load($(this).attr('href') + ' img');

    //get divs from link, inject into divC

","70393","","<p>This is easily done by flipping the current 'checked' state of the checkbox upon each click. Examples:</p>

       var $checkbox = $(this).find(':checkbox');
       $checkbox.attr('checked', !$checkbox.is(':checked'));
 });
</code></pre>

<p>or, by directly manipulating the DOM 'checked' property (i.e. not using <code>attr()</code> to <em>fetch</em> the current state of the clicked checkbox):</p>

<pre><code> $("".offer"").on(""click"", function () {

<p>As as side-note <code>return false</code> has the same effect as <code>preventDefault</code> plus it stops the bubbling of the event to parent elements. jQuery's mechanism for achieving that is in the <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Events/jQuery.Event#event.stopPropagation.28.29"" rel=""nofollow"">stopPropagation</a> method.

","70393","","<p>As far as I know, that is a known issue (bug?). You can easily work around it by testing which button was clicked as follows:</p>

<pre><code>$('a.foo').live(""click"", function(e) { 
    if (e.button == 0) { // 0 = left, 1 = middle, 2 = right

<p>you might prefer using a <code>switch</code> depending on your specific requirements, but generally you would probably just want to do nothing (or or simply return) if any button other than the left button is clicked, as above:</p>

<pre><code>    $('a.foo').live(""click"", function(e) {
        switch(e.button) {

","70393","","<p>The <code>:visible</code> selector does not test the <code>display</code> style property, you want to use <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Selectors/hidden"" rel=""nofollow""><code>:hidden</code></a> instead, <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Release%3AjQuery%5F1.3.2#%3Avisible.2F%3Ahidden%5FOverhauled"" rel=""nofollow"">the 1.3.2 release notes say</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...if your element's CSS display is
  ""none"", or any of its parent/ancestor
  element's display is ""none"", or if the
  element's width is 0 and the element's
  height is 0 then an element will be
  reported as hidden.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These will correctly select your visible rows:</p>

<pre><code>$('.trClass:not(:hidden)').each(function() { 
    alert('visible'); 
});
</code></pre>

<p>or:</p>

<pre><code>$('.trClass').each(function() { 
    if(!$(this).is(':hidden')) {
        alert('visible'); 
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>or:</p>

<pre><code>$('.trClass').filter('not:(:hidden)').each(function() { 
    alert('visible');
});
</code></pre>

<p><code>hide</code> sets the style to <code>display=""none""</code>. The <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Release%3AjQuery%5F1.3.2#%3Avisible.2F%3Ahidden%5FOverhauled"" rel=""nofollow"">release notes</a> for jQuery 1.3.2 also say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In jQuery 1.3.2 an element is visible
  if its browser-reported offsetWidth or
  offsetHeight is greater than 0.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>so I guess in this case the <code>:visible</code> selector is erroneously not matching anything because the rows are not occupying any space according to the calculations performed, despite the fact that their CSS <code>display</code> property is <em>not</em> set to <code>none</code>. Conversely, <code>:hidden</code> correctly matches elements with <code>style=""display:none""</code> so testing for non <code>:hidden</code> elements works just fine.</p>

<p>But is there a better way than to use array indexer? i.e. return is a single object or null if not found.</p>

","70393","","<p>Just to add, you can force IE to trigger the <code>onChange</code> event using the <code>onClick</code> event, so if you are allowed use the <code>onClick</code> event to trigger the change event, this should do it:</p>

<p>That will attach the function to your form's submit event. If any of those elements are empty, the function will return false immediately, preventing the form from being submitted.</p>

","70393","","<p><code>day</code> has not been quoted correctly, I would suggest using a prepared statement <em>like</em> a prepared statement as follows:</p>

<pre><code>...
try {

<p>is the same as:</p>

<pre><code>sql = ""Select count(*) from MyTable WHERE someColumn = '"" + day + ""'"";

<p>with several advantages over the latter (mainly security and performance). See:</p>

","70393","","<p>Instead of using redundant wildcard attribute filters (like <code>input[id*=tCell1]</code>) which tend to slow things down, try selecting elements more directly. If you know the positions of the elements beforehand, it should not be a problem. For example:</p>

<pre><code>$(""table tr"").each(function() {
    $(this).find(""td:eq(0) input[type=text]"").bind('blur', validateCell1);
    $(this).find(""td:eq(1) input[type=text]"").bind('blur', validateCell2);

    $(this).find(""td:eq(4) input[type=text]"").bind('blur', ValidateCell4and5);
    $(this).find(""td:eq(5) input[type=text]"").bind('blur', ValidateCell4and5);

  <p>The difference between attributes and properties can be important in specific situations. Before jQuery 1.6, the .attr() method sometimes took property values into account when retrieving some attributes, which could cause inconsistent behavior.

  <p>For example, selectedIndex, tagName, nodeName, nodeType, ownerDocument, defaultChecked, and defaultSelected should be retrieved and set with the .prop() method. Prior to jQuery 1.6, these properties were retrievable with the .attr() method, but this was not within the scope of attr. These do not have corresponding attributes and are only properties. <a href=""http://api.jquery.com/prop/"" rel=""nofollow""><sub>More Info</sub></a></p>

$result = curl_exec ($ch);
//Here the code ""breaks"" and return the complete string (i've tested that)
//and apparently doesn't get to the json_decode function (i think something's wrong there, so code breaks here)

$response = json_decode($result);

"<p>I'm currently working on an in-house CMS and have come to a bit of a standstill. I'm trying to make it easy to paginate between pages of posts in a blog, and can't decide on how it should be tackled. The real problem only arises when I need to allow a user to choose how many results to display per page or the order to sort posts in.</p>

<p>My initial thought was to simply use a querystring: <code>blog/?page=3&amp;count=20&amp;sort=date</code> but I'm not sure whether this method will have adverse effects on SEO.</p>

<p>For example, is Google sensible enough to realise that <code>blog/?page=3&amp;count=20</code> is the same as <code>blog/?count=20&amp;page=3</code>?</p>

<p>I then thought about using sessions, but again this does not solve the problem above, and possibly makes it worse as some users may not have cookies enabled.</p>

<p>Lastly, I'm already using mod_rewrite for some of the urls, would it be best to use a structure like this: <code>blog/1/20/</code>?</p>

<p>I could really do with some help/suggestions here, there doesn't seem to be a hard-and-fast way of paginating results.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance</p>
","70393","","<p>As long as those query strings are present on the links on your site (via static, normal 'paging' links which are spiderable) there shouldn't be any adverse effects. If your paging happens via sessions, however, that could have an impact, as that's usually done via cookies or by a long query-string propagated session ID. As far as I know, the order of parameters does not matter, as long as they yield the same output from the server.</p>

<p>The simple GET query string paging method works nicely. Google does it too (e.g.: q=test&amp;start=10&amp;...), the point is to make sure everything is reachable via plain-vanilla anchors.</p>

"<p>So I'm new to Ajax.  I have an ASP.NET wizard panel wrapped in an ASP Ajax UpdatePanel.  The Ajax is working well, with the page doing partial updates as you step through the wizard.  I'm even firing an animated gif images using the unblockUI.js jQuery library to prevent multiple page submits.  What I can't figure out is when the page first loads, the wizard panel takes nearly a minute to load initially because of a longish database call.  This isn't an async postback, so my animated gif doesn't fire.  In fact, I just get an hour glass while the page loads.  Is there a way to go ahead and load the rest of the page content and display that gif while the minute long database call is in effect?  I've tried moving the DB call to after the page load, but it's still doing it on the initial page load and I don't get to do it asynchronously.<br>
Again, I'm new to the asynchronous stuff.  This seems like it should be simple, but I'm stuck.  </p>

<p>Update: 
Ok, the tricky part for me was figuring out how to do the data load with the Ajax call.  I have virtually no experience with that.  This may be a kludge, but it's actually working pretty well without too much new code:
I moved the data load from the Page Load to the Load event of my UpdatePanel, but put it in an If IsPostBack.  It's the same code behind that was running before, but now only runs on a postback.  Then in  my markup, I put this (thanks to the answer below):</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function() 
{
    __doPostBack('&lt;%= Me.UpdatePanel1.ClientID %&gt;', '');
});
</code></pre>

<p>I just unhide the waiting div by default and hide it in the If IsPostback piece after the data loads.  I had to mess with some control hiding logic (back and proceed buttons for the wizard, the loading.gif div, etc.), but the only new code was above.  </p>
","70393","","<p>Generally, I would present a spinner or reasonably indicative loading animation <em>before</em> the ajax call commences. If the initial page load takes forever, you could instead kick-off the long running process with an ajax call in your $(document).ready(... function:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function() {
    $('#someId').html('&lt;img src=""loading.gif""/&gt;').load('complex.aspx');

","70393","","<p>Have a <code>user_activity</code> link table. It takes an <code>action_id</code>, <code>user_id</code> and a <code>timestamp</code>.

<p>any help is greatly appreciated!
thanks!</p>
","70393","","<p>You could try something like:</p>

"<p>I'm trying to think a strategy to automate or simplify content submission. A submission is by default done through a form and counts as one entry (some text fields + a random number of file upload fields). Through a web interface, I can imagine this as a regular form. But how can I automate the process to simplify it? </p>

<p>I don't have a particular solution in mind, just wondering what are the most logical approaches that most people would agree are best in this case. I thought about folder submission where the user selects the paths of the one folder or many folders he wants to submit and the system would then internally analyze the content and break them into either multiple entries or 1 entry, and then populate as many entries as needed just as if it were done through a web form. </p>

<p>Any thoughts on this? What challenges should I expect with this approach and are there better approaches to doing this? I hope it's somewhat clear what I'm trying to accomplish. </p>
","70393","","<p>One way could be creating a content bundle specification (which does not have to be complicated). For example, it could contain files, and an XML document which contains all of the information on the items to be posted. The user could simple upload <code>contentBundle.zip</code>.</p>

<p>The server would decompress the archive to a temporary folder, then parse the contained XML file. You can then determine how many items have been submitted, validate their contents, pull out the files relevant to each item and do whatever is necessary to store each one as an separate entity. The XML might look like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;items&gt;
    &lt;item&gt;
       &lt;name&gt;John Foo&lt;/name&gt;
       &lt;mobile&gt;+111111111&lt;/mobile&gt;
       &lt;image&gt;43.gif&lt;/image&gt;
    &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;item&gt;
     ...
    &lt;/item&gt;
&lt;/items&gt;

<p>Now you can easily determine how many 'items' have been submitted and separate the contents of the archive.</p>

"<p>We are supplying a blob of HTML content to be imported and displayed on someone else's page. The owners of the page put a title around our content blob, but the title is the name of our web service that provides the content, rather than a user-friendly name that we want to display to users. They can't figure out how to change the title on their end, we don't want to change the name of our web service, and it needs to look good for a demo in a few days. </p>

<p>The ideal solution would be for them to figure out how to use their portal tool to be able to customize titles, but that is not likely to happen before the demo. So I was thinking we could include some JavaScript in the content that we send them, which would change the title for them. This would buy them time to figure out what they are doing.</p>

<p>The code for their title looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""titleClass""&gt; Bad Title &lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I would like to replace ""Bad Title"" with ""Good Title"". I would like to locate this text on the page using a jQuery selector, but unfortunately there are multiple div items with the class of titleClass and I only want to change one of them.... is there a selector I could use that would also check for the text ""Bad Title"" inside the div tag? Or do I have to write a separate function that would loop through all the different titles on the page, and test each one to see if it contains ""Bad Title""? If I have to do the second, does anyone have sample code to share?</p>
","70393","","<p>First get a collection of all the elements with matching text:</p>

<pre><code>var $matches = $('div.titleClass').filter(function() {
    return $(this).text() == 'Bad Title';
});
</code></pre>

<p>and then replace the text of the matching elements:</p>

<pre><code>$matches.each(function() {
    $(this).text('New Title');
});
</code></pre>

<p>The above will look for elements with text <em>exactly matching</em> 'Bad Title'. If you want any element that <em>contains</em> the text 'Bad Title', e.g. 'A Bad Title', you should use <code>indexOf</code> or <code>search</code>, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>return $(this).text().indexOf('Bad Title') &gt; -1;
</code></pre>

<p>One last caveat is case-sensitivity. If you want to do a case-insensitive match, I would suggest something like this:</p>

<pre><code>// the div contains Bad Title of whatever case
return $(this).text().search(/Bad Title/i) &gt; -1;

// the div exactly matches Bad Title of whatever case
return $(this).text().search(/Bad Title/i) &gt; == 0;

","70393","","<p>I think you're implying that the elements that get injected into the div via your ajax call are losing their event handlers.

"<p>I've come across a tutorial (reputable one if I may add) where the closing php tag <code>?&gt;</code> was omitted. This reminded me of a previous tutorial where the author said it's actually better <strong>not</strong> to close the tag, but didn't explain why. I'm a little surprised, I thought it was better practice to close the tag. Why is it better not to close it and is it all the time or in special cases only.</p>
","70393","","<p>Because any whitespace after the final closing tag can cause the script to fail silently, or cause unwanted output to be sent to the browser. Some frameworks such as Zend Framework have incorporated <a href=""http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/coding-standard.php-file-formatting.html"">omitting the final closing</a> tag as a <em>recommended practice</em> to application developers using the ZF to help avoid such situations, and as a <em>requirement</em> as per their coding standards:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For files that contain only PHP code,
  the closing tag (""?>"") is never
  permitted. It is not required by PHP,
  and omitting it´ prevents the
  accidental injection of trailing white
  space into the response.</p>

","70393","","<p>Double quotes need to be escaped within a double quoted string, alternatively you can use a single quoted string and not have to escape the double quotes, but then you cannot directly interpolate variables, you have to use concatenation instead:</p>

"<p>I'm trying to write a web app which replaces the context menu (right-click menu) with my own customized ones.  I want it so that when the user clicks on a table row, they get one certain context menu and when they click on the background of the page, they get a different one.  </p>

<p>I have already written the menus and gotten them working.  The problem comes in when trying to figure out how to get the background's menu to show ONLY when clicking on the background and how to get the table row's menu to show when that is clicked.</p>

<p>I tried using document.body.oncontextmenu for the body and and setting the oncontextmenu function for each table row, but the body's oncontextmenu function overrides the row's so I get the wrong menu.  The menu for the table rows DOES work if I stop using the body's menu, so that's not the issue.</p>

"<p><strong>Explanation:</strong>
i have few objects and im declaring them inside $(document).ready().  WHY? because in thous objects i have many jquery methods $(..), obviously they can work outside too, but when i include mootool, then it stop working. i tried noConflict and some other things, nothing works, only if i change the $() to jQuery() or to $j().. and i dont want to change for my 20 files and more then 2000 lines for each file. anyway declaring my objects inside $(document).ready(). made them work just fine. </p>

<p><strong>Now My Question is:</strong>
if i declare all these objects inside the $(document).ready() method, would it make my site slow? or would it make things slow from client side? thats the only concern in my mind.</p>
","70393","","<p>I don't see how doing that would make your site slow. By declaring them within the <code>$().ready</code> you're simply restricting the scope of your declarations to that particular <code>$().ready</code> function, thus they won't be available from within the scopes of <em>other</em> ready functions on the same page - which should not really be a bother if your application is well-designed and you've stuck to one per page. </p>

<p>Oh, and your declarations certainly won't have been been parsed until the DOM is fully loaded, (as you know, <code>$().ready</code> only executes once the DOM has loaded), but that too should not be a problem as you're only utilizing them from within a ready function (at least I hope).</p>

<p>Do you really need two libraries? If it's just one or two little tidbits of functionality you are using from one of those libraries chances are you can mimic that behaviour using the one you're making the greatest use of. If you can possibly/feasibly do that it will make your life <em>so</em> much simpler.</p>

  <ul>
  <li>Inconsistent API: There is no single    API for the different source
  formats.    The usage of gettext for
  example is    very complicated.</li>
  <li>PHP supports only gettext and native    array: PHP itself offers
  only support    for array or gettext.
  All other    source formats have to be
  coded    manually, because there is no
  native    support.</li>
  <li>No detection of the default language:The default language of
  the user cannot be detected without
  deeper knowledge of the backgrounds
  for the different web browsers.</li>
  <li>Gettext is not thread-safe: PHP's gettext library is not thread safe, and it should not be used in a multithreaded environment. This is due to problems with gettext itself, not PHP, but it is an existing problem.</li>

<p>It is worth noting that the <a href=""http://framework.zend.com"" rel=""nofollow""><code>Zend Framework</code></a> is not a <em>full-stack</em> framework - in other words, you will not need to use the whole thing just to make use of its internationalization API. </p>

"<p>I am building a website that has a system where users can send messages to each other. I would like it so that when a logged in user received a message, he would get some update on his screen telling him that.</p>

<p>These messages do not have to be in realtime, so I do not think I want to push with comet or juggernaut or anything like that.  Instead, I would be happy to just poll the server every minute or so and listen for updates.</p>

"<p>Ok, basicly, I made a script (that one) that makes a .post to a php file, which then insert some info into a database to track link clicks. Works fine in IE8 and Opera 10, but, doesn't work in Firefox. It simply loads the link target without inserting into the database. It only works if I add an alert() or return false; something that prevents it from going to the link clicked, which is not what i need. I've tried all kind of stuff, nothing helps. 
Looks like Firefox loads the other page faster than it can parse the script. Opera and IE wait, FF doesn't.
Any ideas what might help?</p>

<pre><code> $(document).ready(function(){
           $(""div.buy_block_content a,div.upper-banner a, a.lehitse-big, a.lehitse-small"").click(function(){
           var type = $(this).attr('id');

           });
         });

<p>Edit: Worth to tell is that the tracking is done on Drupal (CMS) so any modifications in the core or passing some stuff with the link doesn't help.
And the tracking is done for both internal links, and links that take you to other sites.

"<p>So I've got this issue with forms generated by Zend Framework.</p>

<p>As we know Zend is using this format for ID of HTML elements, i.e: <code>contactDetails[name]</code>,<code>contactDetails[email]</code> etc.</p>

<p>First of all, why Zend is using <em>invalid</em> HTML to generate forms? There should be no brackets <code>[]</code> inside ids, according to <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/types.html#type-name"" rel=""nofollow"">W3C</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ID and NAME tokens must begin with a
  letter ([A-Za-z]) and may be followed
  by any number of letters, digits
  ([0-9]), hyphens (""-""), underscores
  (""_""), colons ("":""), and periods
  (""."").</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But the real issue I have is <strong>how to correctly select element by id using jQuery, if we must deal with invalid, Zend generated ids</strong>?</p>

<p>In standard JavaScript this seems to work: <code>document.getElementById('contactDetails[email]')</code>.</p>

<p>But in jQuery: <code>$('#contactDetails[email]')</code> - this is obviously wrong, as brackets are reserved for attribute selectors.</p>

<p>The easy workaround I found is to wrap native-js-selected object in $() function:
<code>$(document.getElementById('contactDetails[email]'))</code>. Using this method I can use all jQuery functions on this object, but this seems like a hacky solution...?</p>
","70393","","<p>Try escaping the square brackets:</p>

<p>In my header <strong>OF MY MASTER PAGE</strong>:</p>

  $(document).ready(function(){
    $(""#tabs"").tabs({event: 'mouseover'});
  });
    &lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The site as you can tell has 4 (well 3 really) major sections: Insurance Plans, Mini-Sites, Independent Sites and Tools.  Under each one of these sections there are several pages (all which use the same master page).</p>

<p>The mouse over function works great, the divs hide and display as expected.  The problems that I am having is that <code>div id=""fragment-1""</code> is selected on every page for every section. (As an example, when in the Tools Section, <code>div id=""fragment-4""</code>, I need it to be selected.  I have tried adding <code>$('#tabs').tabs('option', 'selected', 3);</code> in both the head of the .aspx page and in the masterpage for testing and I get an error.  Additionally I have tried throwing <code>$('#tabs').tabs('option', 'selected', 3);</code> into the $(document).ready function, and it still throws an error, both within the .aspx page and the masterpage.</p>

<p><strong>Solution to above problem:</strong>
Placing </p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" &gt;
$(document).ready(function(){
    var $tabs = $(""#tabs"").tabs({event: 'mouseover'});
    $tabs.tabs(""select"", 3);
  });
    &lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>at the end of a page in section ""3"" allows the appropriate tab to be default selected. </p>

<p>While removing:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" &gt;
$(document).ready(function(){
    var $tabs = $(""#tabs"").tabs({event: 'mouseover'});
   });
    &lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>from the header of the master page.</p>

<p>To top it all off, I need the tabs to be clickable to navigate (not an ajax load, but I need for the user, when clicking on the tab to be taken to a different page.  I would assume this would be analogous to window.location().</p>

<p>Can anyone please help with the second part?  I am a jQuery n00b.</p>

<p>Have a look at firebug. In particular, the Javascript profiler. Basically:</p>

<ul>
<li>Install the <a href=""http://www.getfirebug.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">firebug</a> Firefox plugin.</li>
<li>Right click on the little bug icon at
the bottom right of firefox. Select
'enable all panels'.</li>
<li>Click on the 'console' tab.</li>
<li>Click on the 'profile' option.
Hovering the mouse over it says
'Profile Javascript execution time'.
The rest should be fairly intuitive. If you find that it is not, there are plenty of <a href=""http://michaelsync.net/2007/09/10/firebug-tutorial-logging-profiling-and-commandline-part-ii"" rel=""nofollow"">tutorials</a> to help you out. </li>

<p>You can now experiment with different selectors/DOM structures and measure their relative execution times for a better understanding of which selectors actually <em>perceivably</em> impact the performance of your web application.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>So is it possible to just change the on submit or onclick to be able to both submit the form through the external php file, and stay on the same page?</p>
","70393","","<p>Yes it is. I would suggest introducing some Javascript (the following example uses jQuery):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
// when the DOM is ready
$(document).ready(function() {
    // bind some code to the form's onsubmit handler
    $('form[name=theForm]').submit(function() {
        if(formCheck(this)) {
            // $.post makes a POST XHR request, the first parameter takes the form's
            // specified action
            $.post($(""form[name=theForm]"").attr('action'), function(resp) {
                if(resp == '1') {
                    alert('Your form has been submitted');
                } else {
                    alert('There was a problem submitting your form');
                }
            });
        }
        return false;
    });
});
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The return false at the end of the above submit handler prevents the browser from loading up the form's action (following the url) in the traditional way. Furthermore, if Javascript is not present, the form will submit the old school way, so essentially you have added a layer of usability above your standard form implementation which degrades gracefully.</p>

<p>I would like to point out that it is always a good idea to provide the user with realistic feedback. That is to say, the ajax posting of the form can capture some indication of this from the server, in the above example I have assumed that a '1' means that the record was successfully saved, and a '0' means it was not saved (the query failed, etc.). The message displayed to the user depends on this outcome.</p>

"<p>I have to do something very simple, but there doesn't seem to be an easy way to do this, as far as I can tell. I just want to load JSON data from a remote source and store it in a global Javascript variable using jQuery. Here's what I have:</p>

<pre><code>var my_json;
$.getJSON(my_url, function(json) {
  var my_json = json;
});
</code></pre>

<p>The my_json variable remains undefined. I think this is clearly a scope issue. It seems to me the $.getJSON method should return JSON, but it returns an XMLHttpRequest object. If I do this:</p>

<pre><code>request = $.getJSON(my_url);
my_json = request.responseText.evalJSON();
</code></pre>

<p>That doesn't work because until the readystate == 4, the responsetext remains null. It seems you have to use the callback function to return the responsetext, since it fires on success.</p>

<p>It can't be this hard! Right?</p>
","70393","","<p>This will do it:</p>

<pre><code>var json = (function () {
    var json = null;
    $.ajax({
        'async': false,
        'global': false,
        'url': my_url,
        'dataType': ""json"",
        'success': function (data) {
            json = data;
        }
    });
    return json;
})(); 
</code></pre>

<p>The main issue being that <code>$.getJSON</code> will run asynchronously, thus your Javascript will progress past the expression which invokes it even before its <code>success</code> callback fires, so there are no guarantees that your variable will capture any data.</p>

<p>Note in particular the <code>'async': false</code> option in the above ajax call. The <a href=""http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/"">manual</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By default, all requests are sent
  asynchronous (i.e. this is set to true
  by default). If you need synchronous
  requests, set this option to false.
  Note that synchronous requests may
  temporarily lock the browser,
  disabling any actions while the
  request is active.</p>

<p>Even when the user checks several checkboxes, the ""notice"" triggers. It seems selected.length is zero when it shouldn't be. </p>

<hr>

<p>This code is working for the vast majority of users and we can't replicate the issue, but for users that see the issue it's consistent and happens every time.</p>

<p>It seems to be isolated to IE (although I can't be sure). We're using jQuery 1.3.2 (from google CDN).</p>

<p>Any ideas? </p>
","70393","","<p>It would be a good idea to paste your surrounding code/event handler(s). For a starting point, I would suggest using the <a href=""http://api.jquery.com/checkbox-selector/"" rel=""nofollow""><code>:checkbox</code></a> selector in your first line:</p>

<pre><code>$('#mytable input:checkbox:checked')
</code></pre>

<p>The manual says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>$(':checkbox')</code> is equivalent to
  <code>$('*:checkbox')</code>, so
  <code>$('input:checkbox')</code> should be used
  instead.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, that might not make any difference whatsoever. <code>:checkbox</code> is equivalent to <code>$('[type=checkbox]')</code>, so it <em>might</em> be that IE is choking on the <code>input:checked</code> part of your selector which is testing <em>all</em> input elements for the <code>checked</code> state. </p>

"<p>I'm using hoverIntent which, as part of its settings, will call a function. I think this is called 'referencing a function' (correct?):</p>

     over: myFunction,
     timeout: 100,

<p>However, I'd like to reuse said function at times and explicitly pass in a jQuery object. So, I added that to the function. </p>

<pre><code>myFunction($myObject){
}

<p>The challenge now is to figure out when the function is being referenced by hoverIntent or being explicitly called. My thought was that I'd check to see if $(this) contained a particular DOM element:</p>

<pre><code>myFunction($myObject){
     if($(this).is('li')){
       $myObject = $(this)
     };

     $myObject.doSomething...

$myObject = Object { originalEvent=, more...}

<p>I can test for <code>$(this).is('li')</code> in the first scenario, as it's true. </p>

<p>I can't in the second, though, as when I try to perform the test, Firefox doesn't like it:</p>

<pre><code>g.nodeName is undefined

<p>One suggestion was to switch to 1.4.1 and try to test for the opposite via .isPlayObject:</p>

<pre><code>if (jQuery.isPlainObject($myObject))...
</code></pre>

<p>This works just fine in Firefox. However, IE8 always returns true. </p>

<p>My questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is my logic simply way off in terms of how my function gets called from hoverIntent vs. directly? </p></li>

"<p>I tried to use DevExpress's  Controls in one of my projects for its smart and elegant UI interface. When I use normal html or asp controls, one of my page size is around 400KB at the client side. Using devexpress makes the size of that page around 1.2MB, which is almost 4 times the previous version, and I used only 3 round panels and a Date Edit.</p>

<p>This project was intended to be used in my country, where people's browsing speed is usually 8-16kbps (kilo BIT per sec., of course :( ). So using devexpress in that page makes it really troublesome for the users to load that page.</p>

<p>I heard that using jquery it is possible to build UI that is almost as same as DevExpress's Controls, but it will generate far less client-side code.</p>

<p>Is it possible? If it is, then which JQuery plug-in should I use ?</p>
","70393","","<p>I think you need to take a look at <a href=""http://jqueryui.com"" rel=""nofollow"">jQuery UI</a>.

You can <a href=""http://jqueryui.com/download"" rel=""nofollow"">customise your build</a> to include only those widgets that you need (you mentioned a Date Edit, I don't know DevExpress, but my guess is that <a href=""http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker"" rel=""nofollow"">Datepicker</a> probably does the same thing). You can create a <a href=""http://jqueryui.com/themeroller"" rel=""nofollow"">theme online using the fantastic and world-famous ThemeRoller App</a> to be used with those widgets. Furthermore, you can include those libraries (jQuery and jQueryUI) directly from <a href=""http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxlibs/"" rel=""nofollow"">google's CDN</a>, which should speed things up in terms of caching and parallelism (among numerous other advantages).

"<p>My problem is, that the browsers' (IE&amp;FF) autocomplete does not work for my login form.</p>

<p>I have a webapp with CakePHP &amp; jQuery. To allow visitors to login/register unobtrusively. The login form is inside a div, which is loaded via AJAX. (This enables logging in without a page reload.)</p>

<p>The browsers do recognize it as a login field, as they prompt me to save the credentials when clicking login. And they really do save the username/password, as they appear between the saved ones in the browser settings. But the saved username/password is never entered automatically. They do not appear pre-entered when the page loads. When I start typing in the username, the username appears as a suggestion, but even when you select it, the password is not entered next to it. Why? How can I get this working?</p>

<p>That you can test it yourself, here is a simple AJAX login form:</p>

<p><a href=""http://gablog.eu/test/ajaxlogin.html"">http://gablog.eu/test/ajaxlogin.html</a></p>

<p>It loads the following login form, if you go to the url below, autocomplete will work for just the plain form, so it is not a problem with the form itself, but rather that it is AJAX loaded:
<a href=""http://gablog.eu/test/loginform.html"">http://gablog.eu/test/loginform.html</a></p>

<p>The layout:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""user-bar""&gt;
    &lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
        $(function() {
           $(""#user-bar"").load('loginform.html').html();
        });
    &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The view loaded (when not logged in):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form id=""form-login"" action="""" onsubmit=""login(); return false;""&gt;
    &lt;input type=""text"" id=""username"" name=""username""/&gt;
    &lt;input type=""password"" id=""password"" name=""password""/&gt;
    &lt;input type=""submit"" value=""Login""/&gt;
    &lt;div id=""login-error"" class=""error-message""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;

&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
    function login() {
        $.post('/ajax/login', $(""#form-login"").serialize(), function(data) {
            if (data.success) {
                $(""#user-bar"").load('userbar.html').html();
            } else {
                $(""#login-error"").html(data.message);
            }
        }, ""json"");
    }
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>To clarify: I do not want to use AJAX autocomplete, I want the browser's autocomplete to work for my login form. This is an issue between my form and the browser. <strong>jQuery submission seems to play a minor role, as the usernames/passwords are saved. They are just not auto-entered for ajax loaded HTML elements!</strong> (The test site does not use jQuery submission.)

"<p>I am just wondering what general best practice is for saving data in Ajax Forms.  In <a href=""http://spreecommerce.com/"">Spree ECommerce</a> for example, every time you change a value in a list of objects (say you change the quantity of a certain Item in an Order), it updates the database with an Ajax call.</p>

<p>Is it better to have the User manually press ""Save"" or ""Update"" when they're done editing a form, or if you can (you have setup an ajax alternative), to just automatically save the data every time something changes?</p>

<p>It seems like Stack Overflow Careers saves a ""Draft"" of your profile every few seconds using some ajax thing.</p>

<p>As such, it seems like there's 3 ways to save data in a form if you have Ajax going:</p>

<ol>
<li>User presses button, saves all data at once, not good if data is important</li>
<li>Save every time interval</li>
<li>Save every change</li>
</ol>

<p>What do you recommend?</p>
","70393","","<p>Good question. I don't think there's a one-size-fits-all best-practice that covers <em>all</em> situations. Generally, the more user-friendly your solution is, the greater the complexity of implementation, the less likely the potential for a proper gracefully degrading solution (unless you have been very, very careful).</p>

<p>Also, there are implications to whichever approach you have opted to go with. For example, autosaving periodically might <em>not</em> be a good idea where substantial data validation is involved. A user might type some stuff in, and get an error message after a few seconds. Instant feedback would be much more beneficial to the user in such a situation, as it is possible that the input which led to the failed validation was, say, a few actions ago, so it might be somewhat confusing to the user.</p>

<p>Saving whenever the user changes something (a keypress, a checkbox selection, etc.) would <em>seem</em> to be the way to go from a usability perspective, but again, it depends on what you are doing and could have negative side-effects. For example, if the user is on a slow connection, he/she might feel that your site is slow or buggy. It would also yield a lot more database queries than the old-school 'click save' method.</p>

<p>I guess an obvious way to get around some of the above caveats would be to incorporate on-the-spot client side validation, but what works in the end might well be down to what your <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html"">hallway testers</a> say.</p>

<p>Final recommendation: create the old-style 'click save to save' forms and enhance from there, making sure things don't break without javascript (unless you have express permission from a higher authority). Hope that wasn't all nonsense.</p>

","70393","","<p>The <a href=""http://api.jquery.com/load/"" rel=""nofollow""><code>$.load</code></a> manual says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...It is roughly equivalent to
  $.get(url, data, success) except that
  <strong>it is a method rather than global function and it has an implicit
  callback function</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It would seem that <code>$.load</code>'s implicit callback function is overriding the <code>complete</code> callback in your <code>$.ajaxSetup</code>. The <a href=""http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajaxSetup/"" rel=""nofollow""><code>$.ajaxSetup</code></a> documentation says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All subsequent Ajax calls using any
  function will use the new settings,
  unless overridden by the individual
  calls, until the next invocation of
  $.ajaxSetup().</p>

<p>I guess the solution would be to replace your <code>$.load</code> calls with <a href=""http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/"" rel=""nofollow""><code>$.get</code></a> (or the more verbose <a href=""http://api.jquery.com/category/ajax/"" rel=""nofollow""><code>$.ajax</code></a>).

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>In jQuery 1.3.1 (and older) an    element was visible if its CSS<br>
  ""display"" was not ""none"", its <strong>CSS</strong><br>
  <strong>""visibility"" was not ""hidden"", and</strong><br>
  its type (if it was an input) was not 
  ""hidden"".</li>
  <li>In jQuery 1.3.2 <strong>an element is visible    if its browser-reported</strong>
  *<em>offsetWidth    or offsetHeight is</em>*
  <strong>greater than 0.</strong></li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>What does this change mean? It means
  that if your element's CSS display is
  ""none"", or any of its parent/ancestor
  element's display is ""none"", or if the
  element's width is 0 and the element's
  height is 0 then an element will be
  reported as hidden.</p>

"<p>I've got a checkout page which has some ajax calls that update hidden fields when the user changes delivery country for instance.</p>

<p>Most of the time, this works fine, the page has time to update hidden fields before the user clicks submit. Some of the time though, due to slow connection or whatever the ajax doesn't return the hidden fields in time and the user is allowed to submit an incomplete form.</p>

<p>After reading another question on here, I am using ajaxStart and ajaxComplete to disable and re-enable the submit button of the form.</p>

<p>I also want to display a 'please wait' message next to the button to keep the user informed of what is happening.</p>

<p>This all works fine, but in 99% of the cases this message flashes and disappears quickly, too quick to read and looking distracting / buggy.</p>

<p>What I would like to do is only show this message if the ajax call is taking a long time to respond (indicating we've got a slow connection) - say 250ms?</p>

<p>I've not used timers in jquery before so this will hopefully help me get to grips with the concepts involved.</p>

<p>Here is the function so far</p>

<pre><code>// if we're waiting for any ajax to complete we need to disable the submit
$(document).ajaxStart(function() {
  $("".ajaxbutton"").attr(""disabled"", ""disabled"");
  // if it's taken longer than 250ms (say) display waiting message
      $('#processingAlert').html(' ...please wait one moment');
      $('#processingAlert').show();
      // end the if here
})

  $("".ajaxbutton"").removeAttr(""disabled"");
    $('#processingAlert').hide();

"<p>I am working on some auto-suggest feature.</p>

<p>The script is fairly itself. 
When a character is typed in to the textbox it sends a ajax post (or get) request to the php file which queries the database and returns a result set.</p>

<p>But the problem is that the php file is accessible on its own. So it can be called directly. Is there a way to prevent this and make that php file to serve only the ajax request on my application.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
","70393","","<p>No, there isn't. If your script can be requested, it can be requested by anything. It is possible to differentiate ajax requests from normal ones by testing for the <code>x-requested-with</code> header and responding accordingly, that is, if it does not contain the value <code>XMLHTTPRequest</code> you simply <code>exit()</code> the script. However, headers can always be spoofed. So no, you can't.</p>

<p>Relying on the success callback to fire before the submit handler completes execution is unrealistic, since the code following the <code>$.ajax</code> call is very likely to be evaluated before the success callback executes (<code>$.ajax</code> will run asynchronously).</p>

","70393","","<p>If you store each user's library in a <code>$_SESSION</code> as an array, as you suggested (which is definitely possible) you will have to make sure that any updates the user makes to the library are instantly reflected to that session variable. </p>

<p>Honestly, unless there is some seriously heavy querying going on to fetch a library, or you have tons of traffic, I would just stick to 'execute query whenever the user hits library.php'.</p>

"<p>I just came across this weird problem that is happening in IE. In the html I am adding an onclick event to an element that calls a function to change a page like this,</p>

<pre><code>onclick=""changePage(1, 2);""
</code></pre>

<p>Inside the changePage function I am changing the currentPageNum, and nextPageNum of the forward and backwards buttons when the function is called like this,</p>

<pre><code>function changePage(currentPageNum, nextPageNum) {

  var pageValidated = true;

  //If the current page content validates, then we can change the page
  if(pageValidated) {
    //Add new events to both arrow buttons
    $('#goBack').attr('onclick', '').unbind().click(function() {
        changePage(nextPageNum, parseInt(nextPageNum) - 1);
    });

    $('#goForward').attr('onclick', '').unbind().click(function() {
        changePage(nextPageNum, parseInt(nextPageNum) + 1);
    });
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I added the attr('onclick', '').unbind() in order to remove the old onclick event and then add the new one. This is working fine in FF, but in IE it is calling both the new click event and the old at the same time for some reason. I thought that when you attach a new click event that the old one went away, but that does not seem to be the case now. How can I get this working in IE?</p>

<p>I think I know whats happening now. When the changePage function is called, it is removing the old onclick event, adding the new one after the first onclick event and then calling the onclick event that was just added directly after the first one was called. It is acting as if I have 2 function calls inside the same onclick event.</p>

<p>I am using jQuery version 1.4.2. I cut out extra content from this function to simplify it, but this is the part that is causing the problem.</p>

<p>As you can see below the array is imploded.
Then I use the ""IN"" to find all matches.</p>

<p>I can pull the src values fine but I can't change them. In this example the src values aren't changed. Is there a way to do this with selectors or can they only modify DOM elements? Otherwise I may have to do some regex replace but using a selector will be more convenient if possible.</p>

     success: function(data)

  <p>""html"": Returns HTML as plain text;
  included script tags are evaluated
  when inserted in the DOM.</p>
</blockquote>

"<p>I want to add a $ symbol before a users entry into a text field without actually submitting the $ when the user clicks submit. Additionally, I need to prohibit the user from entering anything but numerical values in to the text input.

Can anyone think of a way to accomplish what I have described above?  </p>
","70393","","<p>One way would be to grab everything except for the dollar from the input, and store it in a hidden field:</p>

    var total = $(""#total"").val();
    $(""#hidden"").val(total.replace(""$"", """"));
});
</code></pre>

<p>Here's a full working solution (bear in mind, it probably needs refinement before it meets the real world):</p>

<pre><code>$(""form"").submit(function() {
    var total = $("".total"").val();
    $(""#hidden"").val(total.replace(""$"", """"));
});
$(""#total"").keypress(function() {
    validateNumeric();
}).keyup(function() {

    // if the user has pressed backspace and removed the dollar, put it back
    if($(this).val() == null || $(this).val() == """") {
        $(this).val(""$"");
    }
});

function validateNumeric(evt) {
    var theEvent = evt || window.event;
    var key = theEvent.keyCode || theEvent.which;
    if(key == 8) {
        return true;
    }
    key = String.fromCharCode( key );
    var regex = /[0-9]/;
    if( !regex.test(key) ) {
        theEvent.returnValue = false;
        theEvent.preventDefault();
    }
}

$countr = count($words);
if ($countr &lt;= 8)

// return with no change if string is shorter than $limit

<p>And the Jquery part of code where I want to in "".html"" part somehow call this function is:</p>

<pre><code>$("" .text"").html('&lt;div&gt;'+ message +'&lt;/div&gt;');
</code></pre>

<p>What I want to do is trim this ""message"" text using PHP function. Is it possible?</p>
","70393","","<p>In your JS, send the text to be trimmed to the script which will do the trimming. The server should send back the trimmed string, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>var theText = $(""#aTextarea"").val();
$.post('trimscript.php', {text: theText}, function(response) {
    $('.text').html('&lt;div&gt;' + response + '&lt;/div&gt;');
});
</code></pre>

<p>In your PHP, grab the GET or POST variable, trim it, and send it back:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
if(isset($_POST['text']) &amp;&amp; !empty($_POST['text'])) {
    $text = trim_text($_POST['text']);
    echo $text;
}
?&gt;

<p>I think that describes the flow of what's needed. Of course, there are numerous other ways to implement this, the above is merely a simple example.</p>
"
"<p>I am supposed to submit 2 values called str and name to another page.But only 1value is getting returned in the next page. When I include name and on next page if I say <code>print_r($_POST)</code>,then even the first value is not getting printed. I have written a function as follows,which works because there is only one parameter.</p>

<pre><code>function sendValue(str)
{
$.post(
""newsletter/subscribe.php"", //Ajax file
{
     sendValue: str 
},
function(data){
        $('#display').html(data.returnValue);
           },
    ""json""
);
}
</code></pre>

<p>But if I pass 2 values in that function and in <code>$.post</code>, I do <code>sendValue:str,name</code> then I am not getting even 1 value.</p>
","70393","","<p>You cannot assign comma separated values to the same key within an object, as it breaks Javascript syntax. You will need two <em>pairs</em>, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>function sendValue(str)
{
    $.post(
    ""newsletter/subscribe.php"", //Ajax file
    {
        sendValue: str, anotherValue: anotherStr 
    },
    function(data){
        $('#display').html(data.returnValue);
    },
    ""json""
    );
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then in your PHP script, you can access <code>anotherValue</code> as <code>$_POST['anotherValue']</code>, and it will correctly show up in <code>print_r($_POST)</code>.</p>

<p>If you prefer, you can send a single string with key value pairs as follows:</p>

<pre><code>$.post( ""newsletter/subscribe.php"", ""theValue=something&amp;anotherValue=somethingelse"",
        function(data){
            $('#display').html(data.returnValue);

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function() {
    $(""#privacy_policy"").click(function() {

        // block the checkbox
        $(this).attr(""disabled"", ""disabled"");
        var checked = 0;
        if($(this).is("":checked"")) {
            checked = 1;
        }

        // send the checked state to PHP script
        // if the update has been successful, the script echos a '1'
        $.post('account.php', { checked: checked, function(resp) {

            // update has been successful
            if(resp == 1) {

                // unblock the checkbox, the current 
                // checked state reflects the stored value
                $(this).removeAttr(""disabled"");
            } else {
                alert(""settings could not be updated"");
            }
        });

    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>That will handle the real-time manipulating of that particular option's setting every time the checkbox is clicked. (I think that's what you meant, anyway). You just need to act on the <code>$_POST['checked']</code> variable internally.</p>

<p>To set up the initial state of the checkbox based on a stored value (the first time the page loads), just use short tags, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
$isChecked = $_SESSION['someSetting']; // 1 or 0, for example

"<p>I have an HTML page.</p>

<p>I would like to extract all elements which name starts with ""q1_"".</p>

<p>How can I achieve this in JavaScript ?</p>

<p>Thanks !</p>
","70393","","<p>A quick and easy way is to use <a href=""http://jquery.com"">jQuery</a> and do this:</p>

<pre><code>var $eles = $("":input[name^='q1_']"").css(""font-color"",""yellow"");
</code></pre>

<p>That will grab all elements whose <em>name</em> attribute starts with 'q1_'. To convert the resulting collection of jQuery objects to a DOM collection, do this:</p>

<pre><code>var DOMeles = $eles.get();
</code></pre>

<p>see <a href=""http://api.jquery.com/attribute-starts-with-selector/"">http://api.jquery.com/attribute-starts-with-selector/</a></p>

<p>In pure DOM, you could use <code>getElementsByTagName</code> to grab all input elements, and loop through the resulting array. Elements with <code>name</code> starting with 'q1_' get pushed to another array:</p>

<pre><code>var eles = [];
var inputs = document.getElementsByTagName(""input"");
for(var i = 0; i &lt; inputs.length; i++) {
    if(inputs[i].name.indexOf('q1_') == 0) {
        eles.push(inputs[i]);
    }
}

"<p>Is there a workaround for Internet Explorer to implement the functionality offered by 'this' javascript keyword to get the dom element that triggered the event?</p>

<p>My problem scenario is :
I have a variable number of text fields in the html form, like  </p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type=""text"" id=""11""/&gt;  
&lt;input type=""text"" id=""12""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>..</p>

<p>I need to handle the ""onchange"" event for each text field, and the handling is dependent on the 'id' of the field that triggered the event.
So far I understand that my options are:
1) attach a dedicated event handler for each text field. so if I have n fields, i have n different functions, something like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type=""text"" id=""11"" onchange=""function11();""/&gt;  
&lt;input type=""text"" id=""12"" onchange=""function12();""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>but the text fields are added and removed dynamically, so a better way would be to have  one generic function instead.</p>

<p>2) use the 'this' keyword like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type=""text"" id=""11"" onchange=""functionGeneric(this);""/&gt;  
&lt;input type=""text"" id=""12"" onchange=""functionGeneric(this);""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But this option does not work with Internet Explorer. </p>

<p>Can anyone suggest a work around for getting it work in IE or some other solution that can be applied here?
Thanks.</p>
","70393","","<p>The second option probably does not work because element IDs must start with alphabet or the underscore character (at least, according to the spec).</p>

<p>I would opt for something like this:</p>

<pre><code>// make the ids start with a word, like ""foo"", followed by ""_"", followed by a number
$(""input[id^='foo_']"").change(function() {
    doSomething(this.id.split(""_"")[1]); // extract the number, pass to function
});
</code></pre>

<p>That will attach a change handler to all of your inputs with IDs <a href=""http://api.jquery.com/attribute-starts-with-selector/"" rel=""nofollow"">starting with</a> 'foo', and split the number out of the ID to pass to the generic function which works on the number.</p>

"<p>Can someone please share a extremely simple version of JQuery Ajax with pagination??  </p>
","70393","","<p>I would suggest using the server to take care of pagination, as in it should respond with the correct output based on the received <code>pageNo</code> parameter:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function() {

        $(""#results"").load( ""foo.php"", { pageNo: $(this).text()}, sortBy: $(""#sortBy"").val() );

&lt;a href=""foo.php?p=2""&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;

<p>Note: When an object is passed as the second argument to <code>$.load</code>, a POST request will be made. See <a href=""http://api.jquery.com/load/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://api.jquery.com/load/</a></p>

<p>EDIT: The same as above, but fetching JSON from the server:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function() {

        $.getJSON( ""foo.php"", { pageNo: $(this).text(), sortBy: $(""#sortBy"").val() }, function(json) {

    });

<p>EDIT(again): I would recommend using the server to render in the initial content. If you insist on requesting the first page of results with ajax, one way is to simulate the clicking of the link for page 1:</p>

<pre><code>$(""a:first"").click();

","70393","","<p>Two suggestions.</p>

<p>1 - According to the <a href=""http://code.google.com/apis/visualization/documentation/reference.html#DataTable"" rel=""nofollow"">documentation</a>, <code>addRows()</code> gets invoked like this:</p>

<pre><code>data.addRows([

<p><code>so data.addRows = outputGraphFine;</code> is erroneous to begin with. </p>

<p>2 - <code>outputGraphFine</code> is a string, and <code>addRows()</code> expects an object. To convert a string stored in a variable into an object you will need to tell Javascript to interpret it in expression parsing mode (in otherwords, to <a href=""http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_eval.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">evaluate it as code</a>):</p>

   $('#set1 div, #set2 div').each( function(index) {
    var id = $(this).attr('id');

<p>You se that some of these have a button with a hide funcion. what i want is that when you press the hide button The following elements the have a highernumber in the .de# class should be hidden untill it reaches a LI with the same .de#-class.</p>

<p>so if you press the hide(), i want LIs with ids 3,4,5,6,7 to be hiden.
if i press the next on i want 4,5,6,7, and the thirs i want id 5 to be hidden.</p>

<p>so this is the Javascript i made for it:</p>

<pre><code>function hide(id,de){
 var de2 = de-1;
 $('#'+id).nextUntil('li.de'+de2).hide();
}

<p>The problem is that this function is not working exactly as i want. it would work correctly in the first hide()-function and the third but not in hide()function number two. here it will hide IDs: 4-8. so i want to do something. so i want the nextuntill() to hide elements untill it reaches a LI-element with the same .de# <strong>or a lower</strong> .de#.</p>

<p>Which isn't working - I'm not sure that the logic is correct and how to access the ""holder"" from inside the img.load nested function.  What would be the best way to build this gallery so that the images display only after they've been loaded?</p>
","70393","","<p>For starters, you are not quoting the URL here:</p>

<pre><code>var imgsrc = http://example.com/imgsrc;
</code></pre>

<p>should be:</p>

<pre><code>var imgsrc = 'http://example.com/imgsrc';
</code></pre>

<p>Try this:</p>

<pre><code>$('.holder').each(function(){
    var imgsrc = 'http://example.com/imgsrc';
    var $img = $('&lt;img /&gt;', {src: imgsrc});
    $($img).load(function () {
        $(this).hide();
        $(this).parent('.holder').removeClass('loading');
        $(this).parent().append(this);
        $(this).fadeIn();
    });
});

<p>I think the problem was that the load event was bound to an image <em>without</em> any <code>src</code> attribute (I could be wrong, do let me know how it goes :)</p>

"<p>I'm using jQuery Form (<a href=""http://jquery.malsup.com/form/#getting-started"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jquery.malsup.com/form/</a>) to get send data to a form - is there a way I can then, without refresh, put the results page that's generated by the form into a div on the page?</p>

","70393","","<p><strong>I would suggest <em>not</em> using that form plugin</strong> - it was made back in the days before there was an easy way to serialize form data using jQuery, and serves no real purpose any more. I would suggest something like this:</p>

"<p>Does anybody know of a good Jquery solution to checking for swear words when a form is submitted?</p>

<p>Basically I have a form which submits to Twitter, upon successfully passing a swear word check it will submit via ajax. I know how to do it in PHP (for non javascript enabled users), I did a foreach loop through an array of predefined bad words and checked them against what was submitted.</p>

<p>How would I do a similar thing with Jquery?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
","70393","","<p>I think it would be more practical to do that on the server side. Once your PHP script has checked/filtered the input then PHP submits to twitter. That also guarantees that guys with Javascript switched off cannot post any obscenities (client-side validation should <strong>always</strong> be backed up by server-side validation).</p>

Using <code>document.onmouseover = function(e){</code> can I get the full underlying HTML code of the element which triggered the event?</p>

","70393","","<p>Generally, you would wrap the element with another, and call innerHTML on the wrapper, e.g.:</p>

"<p>Up until now i've been dropping all my jquery code right inside the document.ready function. I'm thinking that for certain situations this isnt the best way to go. </p>

<p>for example: If i want an animation to perform when a certain page loads what is the best way to go about that.</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function() {
    $(""#element_1"").fadeIn();
    $(""#element_2"").delay('100').fadeIn();
    $(""#element_3"").delay('200').fadeIn();
});
</code></pre>

<p>If this is right inside of document.ready then every time <strong>ANY</strong> page loads it's going to check each line and look for that element. What is the best way to tell jquery to only perform a chunk of code on a certain page to avoid this issue.</p>
","70393","","<p>Only include the code you <em>want</em> to be executed when the DOM is ready for that particular page. <code>$(document).ready(...</code> does not mean that you should have the same chunk of code run on each page. That would necessitate performing various checks in order to know what needs to be executed.</p>

<p>I'm sure that you will have some common functionality that you would want to execute on each page, as well as some page-specific functionality. If that is the case, then you could put the common functionality into a single function, and call it from the <code>$(document).ready(...</code> such that the only remaining code is specific to that particular page. For example:</p>

<pre><code>function common() {
    alert('hello');
}

$(document).ready(function() {
    common();
    // do some page-specific stuff
});
</code></pre>

<p>I disagree with performing various checks on every single page so the code knows where we're at. It seems cumbersome and totally avoidable, for instance:</p>

<pre><code>function doAnimation() {
    $(""#element_1"").fadeIn();
    $(""#element_2"").delay('100').fadeIn();
    $(""#element_3"").delay('200').fadeIn();
}

$(document).ready(function() {
    if(window.location.href == 'http://example.com/foo') {
        doAnimation();
    }
    if(this page has blah) {
        doBlah();
    }
});

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function() {
    // do stuff for foo.php

"<p>I want to build web page with ""Graceful Degradation"". That is, the web page functions even javascript is disabled. Now I have to make design decision on the format of AJAX response.</p>

<p>If javascript is disabled, each HTTP request to server will generate HTML as response. The browser refreshes with the returned HTML. That's fine.</p>

<p>If javascript is enabled, each AJAX HTTP request to server will generate ... well, JSON or HTML. </p>

<p>If it is HTML, it is easy to implement. Just have javascript to replace part of page with the returned HTML. And, in server side, not much code change is needed. </p>

<p>If it is JSON, then I have to implement JSON-to-html logic in javascript again which is almost duplicate of server side logic. <strong>Duplication is evil</strong>. I really don't like it. The benefit is that the bandwidth usage is better than HTML, which brings better performance.</p>

<p>So, what's the best solution to Graceful Degradation? AJAX request better to return JSON or HTML?</p>
","70393","","<p>I don't think there can be a 'best solution` for <em>any</em> given situation. Only perhaps, an 'appropriate solution' for a particular one. It really depends on what you are trying to do. What graceful degradation means to me is:</p>

<ul>
<li>build a 'good enough' interface that works on as many browsers (desktop and mobile) as possible.</li>
<li>Unobtrusively add in some scripting (validation methods, interface elements such as tabs and sliders or whatever) that will only be present if the browser the page has loaded in has the features needed to make them work.</li>
</ul>

<p>Whether to use HTML or JSON in the server response is highly subjective, I often find myself struggling to choose between them. One might argue, for instance that receiving a bunch of key-value pairs from the server and rendering them into an existing select element would mean <em>more code</em> and therefore more time spent coding and more potential bugs. Instead, you could simply request the pre-built select element from the server, and inject it into a container. The logic for building the element already resides on the server, why build it twice, in two different languages.</p>

<p>The other perspective is that JSON minimises bandwidth usage, so it is worth going the extra mile to parse some JSON to build some markup on the client. I find it easy to disagree with that point of view, for a couple of reasons (I am <em>not</em> generalising, don't get me wrong). First of all, many, many webservers are configured to compress/deflate/gzip their output, and many, many browsers accept compressed content. Markup is <em>extremely</em> compressible, as it contains boatloads of redundancy (<code>&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</code>). It is therefore reasonable to consider that the size of a JSON response would not be overwhelmingly smaller than a response-with-markup. Secondly, a large dataset could mean a sizable execution time on the client (nasty, nested loops are commonplace - evident in some of the questions that pop up here).</p>

<p>My advice to you is to try to understand the upsides and downsides to each approach, and to leverage that information. You might want to read this:</p>

","70393","","<p>From what I can gather, the issue you are facing is that you need to send only the GUID which belongs to the clicked button - i.e. the next one in the document. If I'm correct, you can try this:</p>

<pre><code>$("".button"").livequery('click', function(event) {
    // get the next GUID value
    var GUID = $(this).nextAll('.GUID:first').val();
    ...

","70393","","<p>That will not work. If you want the placeholder to be substituted you will need to pass in two parameters to <code>where()</code>, e.g.:</p>

<p>Otherwise, the single string you are passing will be used for the where clause as-is, so you would need to do something like:</p>

<pre><code>$search = ""pd_phone = "" . $patient_search_name;
</code></pre>

<p>That is to say, build the entire where clause as a single string. Alternatively, use the <code>select</code> object within the switch statement, e.g.:</p>

                     break;

"<p>i have a button on the page in asp.net mvc control.. when I click the button its taking some time to finish the work on my page..

<p>is this the good idea to use jquery ui blcok? or do I need to do in other way?</p>

<p>if so how to do this kind of behaviour?</p>

","70393","","<p>You can simply disable the form and all interact-able elements if you think using a blocking API (such as blockUI) is overkill, e.g.:</p>

"<p>I need to be able to open an ID'd jQuery UI Modal on a page when that modal's ID is passed in the page's URL.  For example:</p>

<pre><code>http://mysite.com/visit.html#directions
</code></pre>

<p>#directions is an ID'd DIV at the very bottom of the page, right before the closing BODY element.  It's instantiated as a jQuery UI dialog on page load, then I'm running a function to check the current URL for the modal's ID.  If the URL contains the modal's ID, the modal is opened.</p>

<p>Here's what my auto-open function looks like:</p>

<pre><code>function autoOpenModal() {
    if ( document.location.href.indexOf('#') ) {
        var uriParts = document.location.href.split('#');
        var hashID = '#' + uriParts[1];
        if ( $(hashID) &amp;&amp; $(hashID).hasClass('dialog')) {
            $(hashID).dialog('open');
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem I'm having is that the browser is automatically scrolling down to the ID at the very bottom of the page <strong>before</strong> the modal is opened.  So when the user closes the modal they're at the bottom of the page (which seems ""broken"" to me).</p>

<p>Can anyone tell me how I stop the browser from auto-scrolling down to the ID please?  I've had a look at <code>event.preventDefault()</code> but without success; I'm not sure where or how to use it in the event chain.</p>

","70393","","<p><code>$.getJSON</code> likes to fail silently when it received malformed JSON. Check that your JSON is well-formed, or try with a simple tiny bit of JSON to get it working. From the <a href=""http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/"" rel=""nofollow"">manual</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Important</strong>: As of jQuery 1.4, if the JSON file contains a syntax error,
  the request will usually fail
  silently. Avoid frequent hand-editing
  of JSON data for this reason. JSON is
  a data-interchange format with syntax
  rules that are stricter than those of
  JavaScript's object literal notation.
  For example, all strings represented

"<p>I have a bunch of input text boxes that have the attribute ORIGINAL set to their initial value, so that when the user changes the textbox value, jQuery can highlight items that have changed (by comparing the text box's current value to the ORIGINAL attribute's value)</p>

<p>What Im trying to do now is provide the user with a button that they can click to revert all text boxes back to their original values based on the value of the ORIGINAL attribute of each text box.</p>

<p>Example</p>

<pre><code>$('input[type=text]').val($(this).attr('original'));

<p>You can't use a one-liner, as <code>$('input[type=text]').val()</code> will return only the value of the first element in the matching collection. <code>$(this)</code> does not mean what you think it does in your example:</p>

<pre><code>$('input[type=text]').val($(this).attr('original'));
</code></pre>

<p>It in fact refers to the current scope. When you iterate over a collection using <code>each</code> jQuery will invoke it's callback and assign the <em>current</em> element in the iteration as the current scope (<code>$(this)</code> or <code>this</code>).</p>

<p>As a side-note, <code>input:text</code> is a prettier, more concise way of saying <code>input[type=text]</code>.</p>

<p>I am ajaxing in a form, then firing the click event on relevant checkboxes to ajax in another partial if necessary.  The form is inserted nicely, and the click events are fired, checking the boxes that need to be checked and firing the second ajax, since the <code>checked</code> attribute of the checkbox was initially <code>false</code>.</p>

<p>What's curdling my cheese is if I UNCHECK one of those boxes.  Despite <code>e.preventDefault()</code>, the <code>checked</code> attribute is set to <code>false</code> BEFORE the test, so the <code>if</code> statement always executes the <code>else</code> statement.  I've also tried this with <code>$.is(':checked')</code>, so I'm completely baffled.</p>

<p>It appears that unchecked -> checked state reads the original state, but checked -> unchecked doesn't.  Any help?</p>
","70393","","<p>It seems to be a due to asynchronous requests. The execution goes past <code>$.ajax</code>, before it's success callback fires. When you click the checkbox again, it's state has not yet been updated by the previous request's callback. What you can try is to disable the checkbox control prior to firing the ajax call, and enable it again within the success callback:</p>

<pre><code>that.attr(""disabled"", ""disabled"");
var url = AJAX_URL;   
$.ajax({
    type: 'GET',
    url: url,
    dataType: 'html',
    success: function(data){

        that.parents('li').siblings('li.verification').children('div.media-verification').append(data).fadeIn(500);
        that.attr('checked', 'checked');
        that.removeAttr('disabled');
    }
});

<p>That will ensure that two successive clicks will not lead to unpredictable behaviour. The other way would be to use a synchronous request, i.e. <code>async: false</code> but that will block the entire browser for it's duration.</p>

<p>examples:</p>
","70393","","<p>I've created a simple example (using jQuery) to help you understand the breakdown of the things that will need to happen, which are:</p>

<p>1 - Periodically polling the server (via ajax) using Javascript's <code>setTimeout</code> to check that what is loaded into the browser is the latest content. We can achieve this by fetching the latest item ID or whatever and comparing it to a variable, which was initialised when the page first loaded.</p>

<p>2 - If the item ID does not match (a bit of an oversimplification) then we can assume that there has been an update, so we replace the content of some element with some content from some page.</p>

"<p>I am using Jquery UI tabs, and have it set to toggle the opacity with each slide change.  I'm wondering if there's a way to apply the opacity toggle to only a single element within each tab, instead of the entire tab.  My understanding of jQuery is pretty basic, so bear with me.</p>

<p>So, If I have something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""tabs""&gt;
   &lt;ul id=""tabs-nav&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
   &lt;div id=""tab-1""&gt;

   &lt;div id=""tab-2""&gt;
      &lt;img /&gt;
      &lt;p /&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   ...etc
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>How could I set it so that only the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> has an effect applied, and the rest just switches normally?</p>

<p>Here are the basics of the call I have for UI tabs:</p>

<pre><code>var $tabs = $('#slides').tabs({fx: { opacity: 'toggle' } });
$("".ui-tabs-panel"").each(function(i){
    //stuff to create previous/next links
});
$('.next-tab, .prev-tab').click(function() {  
   $tabs.tabs('select', $(this).attr(""rel""));
   return false;
});
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>UPDATE:  So this is what I ended up with based on karim79's suggestions, and it seems to work. I added this after the original code I showed above (and removed <code>{fx: { opacity: 'toggle' } }</code> from my original code):</p>

<pre><code>$( ""#slides"" ).bind( ""tabsselect"", function(event, ui) {
        $(ui.panel).find(""img"").fadeOut().fadeIn();
});
</code></pre>

<p>I'm going to explain my logic, because like I said, my understanding is basic, so I'd love to know if my rationale is off!</p>

<p>I removed karim79's coniditional statement, because I want this to apply to ALL of the tabs.  Am I correct in understanding that an <code>if(ui.index == 2)</code> would only apply to the third tab?</p>

<p>Then, I changed the <code>.css(""opacity"", 0.6)</code> to <code>.fadeOut().fadeIn()</code> because the .css opacity was only succeeding in making all of the slides semi-transparent, but not fading anything in or out.</p>

<p>Would this be an acceptable way of doing this or is it somehow hackish?</p>
","70393","","<p>This should do it:</p>

<p>2 - Get the price from the cell in the same row whose class begins with 'price', multiply that by the quantity, and update the 'total' cell of the same row.</p>

<p>3 - (Re)calculate the grand total (the sum of all totals) and put that value into the <code>.grandtotal</code> cell.</p>

"<p>I have a PHP site with a login system, and am trying to make a feature where only specific usernames can view particular images. I think what I'm trying to do is more involved than merely changing the .htaccess file, because a) this won't help discern between users that are/aren't allowed to view the image, and b) if someone enters the exact URL of the image (<code>""directory/images/photos/230ru0q0238rn230nd_asdi0nqn8.jpg""</code>) they can still view the image (since it's a physical file in the directory, and not text in a DB, etc.). Again, restricting via .htaccess would restrict the directory as a whole, or all files in it, so I can't figure out how it would work. Ideally, all images would be blocked by trying to access them directly through their direct URL, and the image would only appear between <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tags if the user's session/username is valid, else they get an error message.</p>

<p>I've heard the term ACL but I'm not sure this is related to what I'm trying to do.</p>
","70393","","<p>What you can do is create a simple context which outputs an image as a stream. The image which is output depends on the id (or some identifier) e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>viewImages.php?imageId=234643
</code></pre>

<p>viewImages.php checks if the user is logged/authorised in (via $_SESSION most likely), and if so, it sends the image to the browser possibly using <a href=""http://php.net/manual/en/function.readfile.php"" rel=""nofollow""><code>readfile</code></a>.</p>

"<p>How can I stop loading function after user is clicked too many times on link?</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function(){
$("".menu_rfr"").click(function() {
$(""#main"").html('&lt;img src=""img/spin.gif"" class=""spin""&gt;');
location.replace($(this).attr('rel'));

});

$("".menu_clickable"").click(function() {
$(""#main"").html('&lt;img src=""img/spin.gif"" class=""spin""&gt;');
$(""#main"").load($(this).attr('rel'));

});

});

&lt;div class=""menu_clickable prof_info3"" id=""prof_info"" rel=""?a=3""&gt;info 3&lt;/div&gt;

<p>this is the link of the sample page with this Jquery code.

","70393","","<p>Disable the button once it has been clicked:</p>

        // reactivate it after some loading has completed
        $(this).removeAttr(""disabled"");

<p>You should always reactivate the link within the <code>success</code> callback to ensure that the loading has completed, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>$.get($(this).attr('rel'), function(html) {
    $(""#main"").html(html);
    $(this).removeAttr(""disabled"");
});
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT: updated, based on your comment. If your 'action' element is a div, you will have to unbind the click event to prevent re-clicks from having an effect, and re-bind once the loading has completed e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>function handleClick() {
    $(this).unbind(""click"");
    $(""#main"").html('&lt;img src=""img/spin.gif"" class=""spin""&gt;');
    $(""#main"").load($(this).attr('rel'), function() {

        // reactivate it after some loading has completed

<p>Nonetheless the autocomplete still doesn't work (admittedly another question altogether, so I will also post another question so it has an appropriate title).</p>

<pre><code>var dataArray = ""Manuscript|Text|Information Object|Basketball|Ball|Sporting Equipment|Tarantula"".split(""|"");
</code></pre>

<p>and then</p>

<pre><code>$(""#example"").autocomplete(dataArray);
</code></pre>

<p>It all works fine, but when I get the value of dataArray from the server it doesn't.</p>
","70393","","<p>You're running into that problem because the $.ajax call does <em>not</em> return before the autocomplete is initilised, due the the asynchronous nature of XHR. The request is sent, execution flows into the next expression before <code>dataArray</code> has been filled up within the <code>success</code> callback. Try this:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function(){
        $.ajax({
            type: ""GET"",
            url: ""AutoComplete"",
            dataType: 'json',
            data: queryString,

                $(""#example"").autocomplete(dataArray);
            }
        });
});
</code></pre>

<p>That will ensure that your autocomplete is initialised only when the response from the server has been received.</p>

"<p>How to compare browser versions via javascript?</p>

","70393","","<p>You should employ <a href=""http://www.quirksmode.org/js/support.html"" rel=""nofollow"">object/feature detection</a> to ensure that something will work before you apply it. From that link:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While browser detection works well
  enough for 90% of your visitors, some
  obscure browsers won't be treated
  correctly and browsers that appear
  after you've written the page may not
  be adequately covered either. The
  results would be either a stream of
  error messages or a script that isn't
  called while the browser can easily
  handle it. In both cases, you're
  cheating your end users and coding
  incorrectly.</p>

<p>To get the browser version, you can use the <a href=""http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_browser.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">Navigator object</a>:</p>

"<p>I am using jquery ajax method on my aspx page,which will invoke the webmethod in the code behind.Currently the webmethod takes a couple of parameters like firstname,lastname,address etc which I am passing from jquery ajax method using </p>

<pre><code>data:JSON.stringify({fname:firstname,lname:lastname,city:city})
</code></pre>

<p>now my requirement has been changed such that,the number and type of parameters that are going to be passed is not fixed for ex.parameter combination can be something like fname,city
or fname,city or city,lname or fname,lname,city or something else.So the webmethod should be such that it should accept any number parameters.I thought of using arrays to do so, as described <a href=""http://elegantcode.com/2009/02/21/javascript-arrays-via-jquery-ajax-to-an-aspnet-webmethod"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.</p>

","70393","","<p>You would just add the parameters to your object, depending on their availability/presence:</p>

<pre><code>var params = {};
if(city != null) {
    params.city = city;
}
params.fname = $(""#fname"").val();

<p>Correct. Disabled form element names/values will not be sent to the server. You should set them as <em>readonly</em> elements.</p>

<p>Also, anchors cannot be disabled like that. You will need to either remove their HREFs (not recommended) or prevent their default behaviour (better way), e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
$(document).ready(function(){
    $(""form#my_form"").submit(function(){
      $('input').attr('readonly', true);

","70393","","<p>A pretty straightforward solution would be to assign a common (thumb or whatever) class to all the small images, and store the filename of the bigger images within their rel attributes, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;img src=""something.jpg"" rel=""something_big.jpg"" class=""thumb""/&gt;
&lt;img src=""somethingElse.jpg"" rel=""somethingElse_big.jpg"" class=""thumb""/&gt;
&lt;img id=""bigImage"" src=""something_big.jpg""/&gt;

$("".thumb"").click(function() {
    $(""#bigImage"").attr('src', $(this).attr(""rel""));
});
</code></pre>

<p><a href=""http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.data/"" rel=""nofollow""><code>data</code></a> is another storage mechanism you might consider.</p>

<p>It is also quite common (and simple) to follow a particular convention and 'assemble' the filename of the larger image based on the src of the clicked smaller one, for example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;img src=""something.jpg"" class=""thumb""/&gt;
&lt;img src=""somethingElse.jpg"" class=""thumb""/&gt;
&lt;img id=""bigImage"" src=""big_something.jpg""/&gt;

$("".thumb"").click(function() {
    $(""#bigImage"").attr('src', 'big_' + $(this).attr(""src""));
});
</code></pre>

<p>That assumes that all of your full-sized images are prefixed with 'big_', so it's a simple matter of appending 'big_' to the src of the clicked thumbnail.</p>

","70393","","<p>A simple way is to implement <a href=""http://api.jquery.com/ajaxError/"">ajaxError</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whenever an Ajax request completes

<p>Make sure that your message divs, forms and form elements have unique IDs (or none, if they aren't necessary). You would be better off giving them a class identifier or such, as in the above example. You will also need to tweak the behaviour of <code>doPost</code> such that it correctly addresses elements based on your new markup structure. The above example has not been tested - my intention here is to give you an idea of what needs to happen rather than to provide a full working solution.</p>

"<p>This question may have been asked already - but unfortunately, I could not find any satisfactory answers. I will just ask it for my concrete case and ask the admins not to delete the question for at least a few days so I can try it out...</p>

<p>I have a page. It uses a captcha. Like so:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
session_start(); // the captcha saves the md5 into the session
?&gt;
&lt;img src=""captcha.php"" onclick=""this.src = this.src"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>That was my first code. It did not work, because the browser condsidered it useless to reload an image if the source is the same. My current solution is to pass a get parameter:</p>

<pre><code>onclick=""this.src = 'captcha.php?randomNumber='+ranNum""
</code></pre>

<p>The JavaScript variable <code>var ranNum</code> is generated randomly every time the <code>onclick</code> event fires. It works fine, still, I don't like the possibility, if the - though improbable - case of two numbers being the same twice in a row. Although the random number varies between -50,000 and 50,000 - I still do not like it. And I don't think the method is right. I would like to know the 'righter' method, by means of AJAX. I know it's possible. I hope you know how it's possible ^^ In that case, please show me.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>By the way - if I spell cap(t)cha differently, never mind, the reference to the PHP file is right in my code: I use randomImage.php</p>

<p>EDIT: The random number in JavaScript is only generated so the image reloads. Captcha.php does not care for the $_GET parameter. The string really is random.</p>

<p>EDIT: Thus, what I would like to know is how to make the browser relaod the image without passing different get parameters every time the event fires.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form action=""v_poll.php"" method=""post""&gt;
&lt;ul class=""voting""&gt;
&lt;li class=""voting votetext""&gt;&lt;input type=""radio"" name=""voting"" value=""a1"" style=""display:none;"" id=""a1""&gt;&lt;a onClick=""vote('a1')""Answer 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=""voting votetext""&gt;&lt;input type=""radio"" name=""voting"" value=""a2"" style=""display:none;"" id=""a2""&gt;&lt;a onClick=""vote('a2')""&gt;Answer 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=""voting votetext""&gt;&lt;input type=""radio"" name=""voting"" value=""a3"" style=""display:none;"" id=""a3""&gt;&lt;a onClick=""vote('a3')""&gt;Answer 3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;input type=""hidden"" value=""1"" name=""id"" /&gt;

&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
function vote(TheValue) {
GetElementById(TheValue).checked=true;
}
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But when i checked the value of the radio box with $_POST['voting'], it is blank. Not the value assigned to the radio box. Anything i'm doing wrong?</p>

"<p>I'm using jquery, and need to accomplish a couple things. </p>

<p>1) When someone clicks on a link (or in my case, a div) to display another div, I'd like to add an anchor to the url. </p>

<p>So, if someone clicks on a ""Live"" link, the 'live' div slides down, and we append #live to the url. </p>

<p>2) If someone visits that page and keeps the #live anchor at the end of the url, then the 'live' div should be visible right away. </p>

<p>I know how to handle the basic part of slideDown() if someone clicks a div. I don't know how to append the hashtag, or make it so that when the page is loaded that hashtag is checked and displays the respective div. </p>

<p>To get a correct index of the clicked link I have to do this in IE 7 (use class info in selector)</p>

   var index = $(""#slide_nav li &gt; a.ohlord"").index(this);
}); 
</code></pre>

<p>On firefox <code>$(""#slide_nav li &gt; a"").index(this);</code> works. On IE this produces incorrect index (0, 2, 4, 6 ..). Is there a way to get the correct index in IE 7 for the above html without using class information in the selector?</p>

<p>My second question is</p>

<pre><code>$('#slides img')[index].attr('style', 'display: block;');
</code></pre>

<p>does not work. I have to <code>iterate through each $('#slides img') elements</code> to set the attribute. Isn't HTMLElement object returned from $('#slides img')[index] an jquery object?</p>
","70393","","<p>To answer your first question, I think the problem is related to the list being badly-formed. The direct children of the UL should be LIs, which should wrap everything else. In your markup, an anchor occurs before each LI - that could be causing IE7 to choke.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a name=""ctn2363_2465"" id=""ctn2363_2465"" class=""hidden""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;**&lt;--this is suspect, restructure**&lt;li id=""button_1""&gt;&lt;a class=""ohlord"" href=""javascript: void(0);"" id=""b1""&gt;Bookbag&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>To answer your second question, you can do this:</p>

<pre><code>$('#slides img').eq(index).attr('style', 'display: block;');
</code></pre>

<p>or:</p>

<pre><code>$('#slides img:eq(' + index + ')').attr('style', 'display: block;');
</code></pre>

<p>or:</p>

<pre><code>$('#slides img')[index].style.display = 'block;';
</code></pre>

<p>or:</p>

<pre><code>$('#slides img').get(index).style.display = 'block;';
</code></pre>

<p>The reason for that is<code>[index]</code> from your example, which is equivalent to <code>.get(index)</code>, gets a DOM element, and not a jQuery object, hence <code>.attr()</code> does not work.</p>

<p>As a final point, <code>.show()</code> can substitute for <code>.attr('style', 'display: block;');</code> and don't forget you can use <a href=""http://api.jquery.com/css/"" rel=""nofollow""><code>.css()</code></a> to get or set style properties, e.g. <code>.css(""display"", ""block"");</code></p>

The bottom line - I cannot rewrite the entire page from scratch as the business cannot justify it.  So... it is what it is.

<ol>
<li><p>Just store/retrieve it using a normal JavaScript declaration - <code>var x = 0;</code></p></li>
<li><p>Use jQuery to store/retrieve the value in a DOM tag - <code>$(""body"").data(""x"", 0);</code></p></li>

<p><del><code>spl_object_hash()</code> is not what I'm looking for because the two objects produce identical hashes</del></p>

<p>The question previously contained an incorrect example of <code>spl_object_hash</code> output; ensuring that both objects exist at the same time produces hashes which are subtly different:</p>

<p>What I want is that when user clicks the button, I need to send using ajax the contents of the field field.</p>

<p>This is what i'm trying to do with no success.</p>

<pre><code>$(function() {
        $('button.sendInfo').live('click', function() {
            var id = $(this).parent().next('[type=text]').val();
            alert(id);
        });
    });

<p>I plan to set what the user types in textbox to the hidden field, and the value received from the ajax call to normal textbox. But the problem is that i can´t even get the value of the textbox that is in the same line as the button the user clicks.
Can anyone help me?

<p>I wish to make use of unbind on the mouseover but it hasn't worked when I tried this:</p>

<p>So I am guessing unbind will only work with events created by JQuery? Is there something else I can try?</p>

","70393","","<p>No, it does not. <code>unbind</code> will <em>not</em> remove events registered through the <a href=""http://www.quirksmode.org/js/events_early.html"" rel=""nofollow"">inline model</a>. Any <a href=""http://www.quirksmode.org/js/events_tradmod.html"" rel=""nofollow"">event registration model</a> events you create (bound to the same element) will overwrite your inline code, but still, <code>unbind</code> will leave those intact.

"<p>Ok so I am new to jquery.</p>

<p>What I am trying to do is to have multiple galleries in one page. 
The in another page I have a div and some links. Depending in which link you click on the gallery to be displayed in the div should change.</p>

<p>All my links have different Ids and all my galleries too.</p>

<p>I know there should be a way to do it with Jquery. Can anybody tell me how I can do this.</p>

<p>Thanks :)</p>
","70393","","<p>Assuming the href of each link points to the gallery of interest, you can do something like the following:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function() {

    // bind to the click event of each link with class 'gallery'
    $(""a.gallery"").click(function() {

        // load the HTML at the href of the clicked link into a div
        $(""#galleryDiv"").load($(this).attr(""href""));
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>If you only want to load in a <em>portion</em> of the target page, just add the appropriate selector to the URL parameter of <a href=""http://api.jquery.com/load/"" rel=""nofollow""><code>load</code></a>, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>// only fetch &lt;div id=""galleryDiv""&gt; from target page
$(""#galleryDiv"").load($(this).attr(""href"") + "" #galleryDiv"");
</code></pre>

"<p>In my PHP Web-App I use sessions to store the user's data.  For exmaple, if a user logs in, then an instance of the User class is generated and stored in a Session.</p>

<p>I have access levels associated with each user to determine their privileges.</p>

<p>Store the user in a session by: </p>

<pre><code>$_SESSION['currentUser'] = new User($_POST['username']);
</code></pre>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>if($_SESSION['currentUser'] -&gt; getAccessLevel() == 1)
{
  //allow administration functions
}
</code></pre>

<p>where getAccessLevel() is simply a get method in the User class that returns the _accesslevel member variable.</p>

<p>Is this secure?  Or can the client somehow modify their access level through session manipulation of some sort?</p>
","70393","","<p>No, the client cannot modify their access level. The only thing stored on the client is the session key which is either propagated via cookie or GET parameter. The session key ties to a corresponding session record which is a file stored on the server side (usually in a temp directory) which contains the 'punch'.
What you don't want, is for a session key to get leaked to a third party:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A leaked session id enables the third
  party to access all resources which
  are associated with a specific id.</p>

"<p>I thought of having an AJAX module service layer, with controllers and actions that interact with my model.  Easy, but not very extensible and would violate DRY.  If I change the logistics of some process I'll have to edit the AJAX controllers and the normal controllers.</p>

<p>So ideally I would load the exact same actions for both javascript and non-javascript users.  I have thought about maybe checking for <code>$_POST['ajax']</code>, if it is set I would load a different (json'y) view for the data.  Was wondering how/a good way to do this (front controller plugin I imagine?) or if someone can point me to an UP TO DATE tutorial that describes a really good way for building a larger ajax application.</p>
","70393","","<p>You can actually use the request object to determine if a request has happened through ajax, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>// from your controller
if($this-&gt;getRequest()-&gt;isXmlHttpRequest()) {
    // an ajax request, do something special (e.g. render partial view)
} else {
   // render entire view
}
</code></pre>

<p>That's basically testing for the <code>x-requested-with</code> header (which is not <em>always</em> present, depending on JS library, etc). See (under the heading of 'detecting ajax requests'):</p>

"<p>Just want to know if there is a way to detect how many times a user has clicked a button by using Jquery. </p>

<p>My main application has a button that can add input fields depend on the users. He/She can adds as many input fields as they need. When they submit the form, The add page will add the data to my database. My current idea is to create a hidden input field and set the value to zero. Every time a user clicks the button, jquery would update the attribute of the hidden input field value. Then the ""add page"" can detect the loop time. See the example below.</p>

<p>I just want to know if there are better practices to do this. Thanks for the helps.</p>

"<p>Lets say I have a class like this:</p>

<pre><code>Class User {
  var $id
  var $name;
}
</code></pre>

<p>And I run a query using PDO in php like so:</p>

<pre><code>$stm = $db-&gt;prepare('select * from users where id = :id');
$r = $stm-&gt;execute(array(':id' =&gt; $id));
$user = $r-&gt;fetchObject('User');
</code></pre>

<p>If I vardump my user object it has all kinds of other fields in it that I have not defined in the User class. Obviously I could make my query specific so that it only gives me back the fields I need/want. But if I don't want to do that is there any way to make this work the way I want it to?</p>

<p>I like the idea of fetchObject, because it's one line of code to create this object and set member variables for me. I just don't want it to set variables I haven't defined in my class.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Well it seems like karim79 is right and the fetch or fetchObject won't work the way I want it to. I've added the following bit of code after I do the fetch to get the desired results.</p>

<pre><code>$valid_vars = get_class_vars('User');
foreach (get_object_vars($user) as $key =&gt; $value) {
    if (!array_key_exists($key, $valid_vars)) {
        unset($user-&gt;$key);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously not the most elegant solution :/ I'm going to extend the PDOStatement class and add my own method fetchIntoObject or something like that and automatically do these unsets. Hopefully shouldn't be to much overhead, but I want to be able to easily fetch into an object with 1 line of code :)</p>

<p>SUPER EDIT:</p>

<p>Thanks to mamaar's comment I went back to the documentation again. I found what the problem is. <a href=""http://us.php.net/manual/en/pdo.constants.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://us.php.net/manual/en/pdo.constants.php</a> and scroll down to PDO::FETCH_CLASS and it explains that the magic method __set() is used if properties don't exist in the class. I overwrote the method in my target class and tada, works. Again, not the most elegant solution. But now I understand the WHY, and that's important to me :D</p>
","70393","","<p>I don't think that's possible. <code>fetchObject</code> will create an instance of the classname specified as <code>fetchObject</code>'s <code>$class_name</code> parameter (which defaults to stdClass). It will not check for existing classes with the same name and create an instance, assigning values only to member variables which match column names in the result. I would suggest relying on something more boring, like this:</p>

<pre><code>$user = new User($result['id'], $result['name']);
</code></pre>

<p>Which would of course mean giving your User class a constructor:</p>

<pre><code>Class User {
  var $id
  var $name;

  public function __construct($id, $name)
  {
     $this-&gt;id = $id;
     $this-&gt;name = $name;

"<p>Good Afternoon,</p>

<p>I am trying to assign some variables to a listing which has a main category and a subcategory. This works fine for most of the variables, however in each sub category there are some fields which are other.</p>

<p>ie
Main Category 1 has sub category database, development and other
Main Category 2 has sub category email, internet and other
Main Category 3 has sub category graphics and other.</p>

<p>So my first case statement is as follows which works fine.</p>

<pre><code>switch ($main_cat)
 {
    case ""Main Category 1"":
      $main=""79"";
        break;
    case ""Main Category 2"":
      $main=""83"";
        break;
    case ""Main Category 3"":
      $main=""87"";
        break;
}
</code></pre>

<p>However I am struggling as to how to handle other.</p>

<p>This stops the whole page loading with no error message</p>

<pre><code>switch ($second_cat)
 {
    case ""Database"":
      $second=""145"";
        break;

<p>I need to see which  elements in #myText have classes that match  elements in #myNotes, and display them.  I can do this using the following jQuery:</p>

    $('#myNotes').find('cite').each(function() {

    });
});

","70393","","<p>I think the inner <code>find</code> is redundantly re-executing for every iteration of the outer <code>each</code>. Try storing the matched elements in a variable before the looping commences. I've also tweaked your solution to get class names via the DOM attribute as opposed to using jQuery's <code>attr</code>:</p>

<pre><code>var $cites = $('#myNotes').find('cite');
$('#myText').find('a').each(function() {
    var anchor = this;
    $cites.each(function() {
        if(this.className == anchor.className) {
            $anchor.show();
    });

","70393","","<p>As far as I know, if you add square brackets to a form input, PHP will expect that key to contain a flat sub-array, so:</p>

<p>The form tag in your markup has no 'method' attribute set, so it defaults to GET. This is evidence that your form is being submitted the normal way.

"<p>I am wondering if anyone knows how to solve this problem. I am using the jquery ui tabs and each tab I have is ajax enabled with caching disabled. So every time the tab loads it should load up all the content again.</p>

<p>It does this but what I don't like is first it displays the old version first while it is trying to load up the new content.</p>

<p>So say if I do this</p>

<p>Click on Tab A it loads up. I then click on Tab B and it loads up. I then click on Tab A again and I see the previous load up of the first time around. As the user I want to click on a button in Tab A so I do that but the thing is that it is trying to load up Tab A again(since it is no caching enabled). So when the user clicks the button nothing will happen and all of a sudden the tab will refresh itself since it has gotten all the new ajax request since it finished loading.</p>

<p>So is there a way when the user clicks Tab A for the second time they don't see the old version or anything till it's finished loading.</p>

<p>This is working as expected. Whenever i click <strong>Hide me slowly</strong>, it is hidden slowly. As the event with the selector "":button"" asks to do so. and
similarly for <strong>Hide me Quick</strong> -- the selector is ""Button"", it is hidden quickly.</p>

<p>But once i change the order of the event handling functions in the script, both of them are hidden slowly.

<p>My question is, i did not changed the selectors only the order is modified. For the selector ""Button"" i have written event handling function to only hide and did not specified ""slow"". But then it is hiding slowly. can you please look into it and let me know why?</p>
","70393","","<p><code>:button</code> will match inputs of type button as well as button elements. <code>Button</code> will match only button elements. So, the Button element in your document gets two handlers bound to its click event since it is being selected by both selectors.</p>

","70393","","<p>Assuming you have just one <code>.hour</code> element per tr, this will do it:</p>

<p><a href=""http://api.jquery.com/closest/""><code>closest</code></a> will:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Get the first ancestor element that

If both are checked, simply alert that BMFNP can only do xxxx, no need to alert it has been added.</p>

","70393","","<p>You can use a single event handler, and significantly shorten the solution:</p>

","70393","","<p>Try using the <code>click</code> event instead. It seems to work when focusing on the input using the keyboard as well, but I haven't tested it cross-browser:</p>

    this.select();
});​

"<p>I have a radio button set called ""pick_up_point"" and I have a change handler to detect the radio button that is checked. In the change handler I call a function ""clearFields()"" which basically clears out the input fields.</p>

<pre><code>function clearFields()
{
 $(""#Enquiry_start_point"").val("""");
 $(""#Enquiry_start_town"").val("""");
 $(""#Enquiry_start_postcode"").val("""");
}

$(""input[name='pick_up_point']"").change(function()
{
 if($(""input[name='pick_up_point']:checked"").val() == ""pick_up_airport"")
 {
  $(""#pick_up_airport_div"").slideDown();
  $(""#start_point_div"").hide();
  clearFields();
 }
});
</code></pre>

<p>I also have a trigger which will retain the view if the form is redisplayed due to a validation error.</p>

<pre><code>$('input[name=\'pick_up_point\']').trigger('change');
</code></pre>

<p>Now when I post the form the trigger is run and it calls the change handler, which of course runs the clearFields() function. So how can I get around this? I don't want the fields being cleared when the form is re-displayed.</p>
","70393","","<p>Try using a custom event handler, like so:</p>

<pre><code>$(""input[name='pick_up_point']"").change(function()
{
    $(this).trigger(""displayForm"");
    clearForm();
});

$(""input[name='pick_up_point']"").bind(""displayForm"", function() {
 if($(""input[name='pick_up_point']:checked"").val() == ""pick_up_airport"")
 {
  $(""#pick_up_airport_div"").slideDown();
  $(""#start_point_div"").hide();
 }
});
</code></pre>

<p>So instead of triggering the change event, trigger the custom <code>displayForm</code> handler, like this:</p>

<pre><code>$('input[name=\'pick_up_point\']').trigger('displayForm');
</code></pre>

<p>And now, when <code>change</code> is triggered, it works as expected, but for the special case of displaying the form without clearing the input fields, you can simply trigger your new custom event handler.</p>

"<p>Ok, I've tried to read up on this but I'm stumped. Unfortunately it's a case of me not understanding javascript properly.</p>

<p>When processing a form with jqueries validation plugin, you send the variables to the php mailer using literal notation: </p>

<pre><code>  submitHandler: function() { 
  $.post(""includes/mail-form.php"",
  {  
  age : $(""#form-age-id"").val(),
  email : $(""#form-email-id"").val(), 
  name : $(""#form-name-i"").val(),
</code></pre>

<p>Which I understand. the variable age is being assigned the value from the element. When I have multiple checkboxes though, I can't use:</p>

<pre><code>$(""input.checkboxes:checked').val()
</code></pre>

<p>as it will only select the first matched element, so i need to iterate over the multiple checkboxes using a function similar to</p>

<pre><code> var allVals = [];
 $('input.orthodontic-medical-form-disease:checked').each(function() {
         allVals.push($(this).val());
      });
 return allVals;
</code></pre>

<p>What I don't understand is how I assign the return value to the literal. I've tried</p>

<pre><code>  submitHandler: function() { 
     $.post(""includes/mail-form.php"",
  {  
  age : $(""#form-age-id"").val(),
  email : $(""#form-email-id"").val(), 
  name : $(""#form-name-i"").val(),
         checkboxes : function(){
           var allVals = [];

         allVals.push($(this).val());
         });a
           return allVals;

<p>Annoyingly, and confusingly, next will only select the very next sibling. The fact that you can filter by passing in a selector makes you think that it will keep going until it finds something, but that is not the case.

If there's no elements checked, my button should be disabled and have the class disabled added aswell. If there's just one element checked the button should not be disabled, neither have the class disabled.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function(){

    if($(this).parents('.table_form:eq(0)').find(':checkbox').is(':checked')) {

","70393","","<p>I don't have a lot to say about optimization here, but presumably you are trying to set this to disabled:</p>

<pre><code>$(""#delete_selected"").attr(""disabled""); // won't work, simply returns true or false
</code></pre>

<p>It should instead be:</p>

<pre><code>$(""#delete_selected"").attr(""disabled"", true); // or ""disabled""
</code></pre>

<p>and you could use chaining:</p>

<pre><code>$(""#delete_selected"").attr(""disabled"", true)
                     .removeClass(""disabled"");
</code></pre>

<p>See <a href=""http://api.jquery.com/attr/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://api.jquery.com/attr/</a></p>

<p>Also, this condition:</p>

<pre><code>if($(this).parents('.table_form:eq(0)').find(':checkbox').is(':checked')) {
</code></pre>

<p>can be changed to the slightly more concise:</p>

<pre><code>if($(this).closest('.table_form').find(':checkbox:checked').length) {
</code></pre>

<p>But that's really a preference thing.</p>

"<p>So right now, I have a few forms where as one is submitted, it retrieves another in a modal. So right now, I might have a link to example.com/modal/1, which opens the first modal. However, if javascript is not enabled (so the browser actually follows the link), then some html displays (the html that was going to be retrieved.). I'd like to be able to style this, so I'm guessing I should make an entire html page with stylesheets and all, but here's what I'm wondering:</p>

<p>With jquery's <code>load()</code>, I know you can choose an element id like <code>'#form'</code> which will parse what the request gets back and just use the #form element. I'd like to be able to use something like that, but I'm using the <code>post()</code> functionality.</p>

<p>Ideas on how to do this?</p>
","70393","","<p>If you pass an object (key/value pairs) as second (<code>data</code>) parameter to <code>$.load</code>, it will perform a POST request. From the <a href=""http://api.jquery.com/load/"" rel=""nofollow"">manual</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The POST method is used if data is
  provided as an object; otherwise, GET
  is assumed.</p>

"<p>I recently needed to append some data to dynamically created <code>LI elements</code>. In my first instance, I used <code>.data()</code> in a way like</p>

<pre><code>var _newli = $('&lt;li&gt;foobar&lt;/li&gt;');
_newli.data('base', 'ball');
// append _newli to an `ul`
</code></pre>

<p>that.. was <strong>terribly</strong> slow. This logic happens in a loop which can easily grow up to 500+ items, it took ages! Sometimes it even broke the javascript execution time frame.</p>

<p>So I changed to <code>$.data()</code>. Somehow, attaching data to an object with that is like <strong>8x</strong> faster than doing it over the <code>.data()</code> method call. So now it looked like</p>

<pre><code>var _newli = $('&lt;li&gt;foobar&lt;/li&gt;');
$.data(_newli[0], 'base', 'ball');
// append _newli to an `ul`
</code></pre>

<p>That was/is indeed faster, but still it took like 3-4 seconds(!) to build up all my elements (In my real code there are like 6 calls to $.data per element).</p>

<p>So I was really stuck with that, I asked myself why the heck to use <code>.data()</code> or <code>$.data()</code> anyway? I could just attach my data to the <code>DOM object</code>. So I did</p>

<pre><code>var _newli = $('&lt;li&gt;foobar&lt;/li&gt;');
_newli[0].base = 'ball';
// append _newli to an `ul`
</code></pre>

<p>Voila, <strong>wow</strong> to my shock, that was incredibly fast! I couldn't believe that this ran so good without any disadvantage. So that is what is my question all about actually. I didn't find any disadvantage for this technique so far on the net. There are reads about <strong>circular references</strong> you can create using this way, but AFAIK ""only"" on IE's and only if you refer to <code>objects</code>.</p>

<p>Any thoughts experts ?</p>

<p><strong>update</strong></p>

<p>Thanks for the good comments and postings guys. Short update @patrick dw:</p>

<p>You are right, I was passing the underlaying <code>DOM element</code> when using <code>$.data()</code>. It does not even work with jQuery objects, at least not as expected.
The idea about using one object and pass it through <code>$.date()</code> I had myself, but then again I was so shocked about the performance difference I decided just to ignore the <code>.data()</code> method like forever.</p>

"<p>maybe I'm totally missing something about even handling in jQuery, but here's my problem.</p>

<p>Let's assume there are some event binding, like</p>

<pre><code>$(element).bind(""mousemove"", somefunc);
</code></pre>

<p>Now, I'd like to introduce a new mousemove binding that doesn't override the previous one, but temporarily exclude (unbind) it. In other words, when I bind my function, I must be sure that no other functions will ever execute for that event, until I restore them.</p>

<p>I'm looking for something like:</p>

<pre><code>$(element).bind(""mousemove"", somefunc);
// Somefunc is used regularly
var savedBinding = $(element).getCurrentBinding(""mousemove"");
$(element).unbind(""mousemove"").bind(""mousemove"", myfunc);
// Use myfunc instead
$(element).unbind(""mousemove"", myfunc).bind(""mousemove"", savedBindings);
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, the somefunc is not under my control, or this would be useless :)</p>

<p>Is my understanding that is possible to bind multiple functions to the same event, and that the execution of those functions can't be pre-determined.
I'm aware of stopping event propagation and immediate event propagation, but I'm thinking that they are useless in my case, as the execution order can't be determined (but maybe I'm getting these wrong).</p>

<p>How can I do that?
Thanks in advance
~Aki</p>

<p>EDIT: I need to highlight this: I need that the previously installed handler (somefunc) isn't executed. I am NOT defining that handler, it may be or may be not present, but its installed by a third-party user.</p>

<p>EDIT2: Ok, this is not feasible right now, I think I'm needing the eventListenerList, which is not implemented in most browsers yet. <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-DOM-Level-3-Events-20020208/changes.html"">http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-DOM-Level-3-Events-20020208/changes.html</a></p>

","70393","","<p>Javascript will not 'wait' for the $.ajax's success callback to fire before returning from the main function, so there's a good chance that nothing will be returned. You will have to either use a synchronous-Jax call by setting the <code>async</code> option to <code>false</code> (which will block the browser for the duration of the request) or revise your strategy, e.g. by doing what you want to ultimately get done <em>within</em> the success callback. For example:</p>

<pre><code>function update_membership_status() {
    jQuery.ajax({
        type: 'POST',
        url: '/ajax/member',
        dataType: 'json',
        success: function(json) {

"<p>Ok, so this works fine for toggling one post on and off at a time.  The script still can't see that it has to make the OTHER posts set to display = ""none"" when the user clicks on a new one.  So if I click on the second post heading after the first, this needs to hide the content associated with the first and the div then displays text for the second post instead.  And onward through multiple post titles.  What's the best approach do you think?  Here's the code that turns one topic on and off (click once to show, click again to hide).  But clicking on one topic and then another increments the content together which isn't what I'd like...  I know I've done this before like a year ago, I just can't remember how I did it. </p>

<p>What you need to do is address the <code>.content-hidden</code> within or relative to <em>each container of the clicked link</em>, as opposed to addressing all of them at the same time.

<p>Do you have any preference ? why ? in which conditions ? </p>

<p>PS: of course the above examples assume you're using jquery but there's equivalents for mootools or prototype.</p>
","70393","","<p>The only advantage that I can think of to using <code>javascript:void(0)</code> is that it will be supported even by the oldest browsers. That said, I would use one of the other <em>unobtrusive</em> approaches you have mentioned:</p>

<ul>
<li>For most uses, <code>event.preventDefault()</code> and <code>return false</code> can be used interchangeably.</li>
<li><code>event.preventDefault()</code> will prevent the page from reloading, as desired, but will allow the click event to bubble up to the parent. If you want to stop the bubbling, you can use it in conjunction with <code>event.stopPropagation</code>.</li>
<li><code>return false</code> will additionally stop the event from bubbling up to the parent.</li>
</ul>

<p>I say 'interchangeably' in the first point above because much of the time we do not care whether or not an event bubbles up to the parent(s). However, when <em>do</em> we need some fine-tuning, we should consider points two and three.</p>

<p>Consider the following example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;Here is some text &lt;a href=""www.google.com""&gt;Click!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;​

$(""a"").click(function(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
});

$(""div"").click(function() {
    $(this).css(""border"", ""1px solid red"");
});
​
</code></pre>

<p>Clicking on the anchor will prevent the default action of the event from being triggered, so the browser will not redirect to www.google.com. However, the event will still 'bubble up' and cause the div's click event to fire, which will add a border around it. Add <code>e.stopPropagation()</code> <em>or just</em> <code>return false</code> and the div's click event will not fire.

"<p>I've been playing around with subscribing elements to AJAX events in jQuery.</p>

<p>I have an element that I am using to load AJAX response's. This element is only displayed IF there is data pertinent to the current context of the program.</p>

<p>So, I thought it would be nice and easy to .show() whenever an AJAX request has completed on it and hide it when I need to. I would like to remove the need to implicitly .show() the element every time I make an AJAX request.</p>

<p>In jQuery there is .ajaxSuccess() and .ajaxComplete(). These however, will fire when any AJAX request completes/succeeds, so when loading data in other parts of the page, my hidden element will .show().</p>

<p>The solution seems to be (per. the jQuery API reference) to use the ajaxOptions parameter in your event handler function:</p>

<pre><code>$('.log').ajaxComplete(function(e, xhr, settings) {
  if (settings.url == 'ajax/test.html') {
    $(this).text('Triggered ajaxComplete handler.');
  }
});
</code></pre>

<p>What I don't understand is the reason for registering an event handler for all AJAX requests to a specific element, besides being able to use $(this). Am I missing something, can I register an event handler for an AJAX request specific to an element?</p>

<p>If not, is there any event driven alternative to using the .url? The reason I ask is that I use the page fragment extensively for tracking page state and it would be easier to have an event handler .show() my element whenever an AJAX request loads data into it.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Create a Facebook ""like"" button for each of the events without entering them into the Facebook system in any way</p></li>
<li><p>Read back the ""like"" status of the current user for any one of those events <strong>via JavaScript or on server side</strong> so I can display these events in a ""events I like"" list. The important thing is that I need to be able to read the status <strong>later = on subsequent page requests</strong>, not only in the moment the user clicks the ""like""  button. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>@karim79's answer does answer the first part, but not the second yet.</p>

<p>this page contains all the information I need to create the button: <a href=""http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/like"" rel=""nofollow"">Social plugins > Like button</a> there also is an FBML event to react to when somebody signs up. But that still doesn't enable me to check the ""like"" status of a returning user. </p>

<p>Is there any way to do that?</p>
","70393","","<p>A brain-dead way of automatically generating 'like' links for your site (which I recently implemented - so I know works) would be to simply generate the 'href' parameter which (facebook's) like.php reads from the iframe source. Just build the iframe code using their widget thingie and use PHP to dynamificate the <code>href</code> parameter:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;iframe src=""http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=&lt;?php echo urlencode($url); ?&gt;%2F&amp;amp;layout=button_count&amp;amp;show_faces=false&amp;amp;width=50&amp;amp;action=like&amp;amp;colorscheme=light&amp;amp;height=21"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""0"" style=""border:none; overflow:hidden; width:75px; height:21px;"" allowTransparency=""true""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You can customise it to a limited extent, just see the attributes list right under the button creation widget.</p>

<p>Using fbml (which I was too lazy to incorporate, and somewhat reluctant due to the fact that I would have had to include yet-another-library):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;fb:like width=""200"" show_faces=""no"" href=""&lt;?php echo $url; ?&gt;""&gt;&lt;/fb:like&gt;
</code></pre>

"<p>I am using a web application framework (Symfony 1.3.6), which follows the MVC pattern.</p>

<p>The view layer is comprised of a template decorator. The template file may also include other templates - this is what gives rise to my question.</p>

<p>Assuming that there is a page (lets call it the 'homepage'), which is comprised of several templates - (the code has been refactored out so the 'sub templates' can be used on other pages.</p>

<p>As a result of the refactoring, the small templates - which are used by the main template - ('homepage' in our example), need to contain their jQuery related code.</p>

<p>lets say the homepage template uses 2 'sub templates:</p>

<ul>
<li>template A</li>
<li>template B</li>
</ul>

<p>assume that template A consists of the following snippet:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""field1""&gt;This is field 1&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
$(document).ready(function(){
   $('#field1').click(function(){
      alert('Field 1 clicked!');
   });
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>assume that template B consists of the following snippet:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""field2""&gt;This is field 2&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
$(document).ready(function(){
   $('#field2').click(function(){
      alert('Field 2 clicked!');
   });
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now the template 'homepage' looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Multiple jQuery snippet test&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;script src=""path_to_jquery""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
 &lt;/head&gt;
 &lt;body&gt;
   &lt;div&gt;include_template('template A')&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;div&gt;include_template('template B')&lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I have tried this - and to my suprise, it worked in that there was only one $(document).ready() in the merged, final page ('homepage).</p>

<p>I am not sure if either my Browser (Firefox) or the web framework (Symfony), had done some 'cleaning up' behind the scenes.</p>

<p>So my question is that what is the best way to proceed if you want to refactor jQuery functionality into 'little reusable templates' that can be reused to provide the same functionality in different pages?</p>

<p>BTW, I hope no one suggests writing a jQuery plugin, as that is SO not what I'm talking about.</p>
","70393","","<p>There are no problems with multiple <code>$(document).ready()</code> calls, only a couple of caveats:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reduced readability.</li>
<li>Scope: a function/variable/object declared inside one <code>$(document).ready()</code> will not be visible in any others. See this simple <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/vmvhz/"">demo</a>.</li>

"<p>Hey I am very new to Web Programming. I have been learning PHP from the past few days and I am stuck at one thing.</p>

<p>I have a form tag in my code which has two submit buttons to manipulate on the data.
Since I can have only one action definition on my form tag, it can lead me to one page only. (Not very sure)</p>

<p>Now depending on the button clicked on the form, I want to load a different page.
One way is to check the button clicked in an if-else construct and then use echo '...' in the branches and show as if it is a different page. But it doesn't seem right for some reason. Can some one give me a better solution? Thanks.</p>
","70393","","<p>One way is to use Javascript to switch the form's action depending on which control has been clicked. The following example uses the jQuery library:</p>

        if(e.target.id == 'first') {

&lt;/item&gt;

<p>... and so on ...</p>

<p>I am trying to use these values for a jQuery autocomplete, where the ID will be submitted via form when the name is selected from the autocomplete.</p>

<p>Any pointers would be helpful. Thanks!</p>
","70393","","<p>If you want the name attribute to appear as the 'label' of the item and the id to be the 'value', you could do this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The local data can be a simple Array
  of Strings, or it contains Objects for
  each item in the array, with either a
  label or value property or both. The
  label property is displayed in the
  suggestion menu. The value will be
  inserted into the input element after
  the user selected something from the
  menu. If just one property is
  specified, it will be used for both,
  eg. if you provide only
  value-properties, the value will also
  be used as the label.</p>

"<p>It seems like the selector <code>"":link""</code> is not supported by jQuery's <code>filter()</code> or <code>is()</code> function.

"<p>My last question asked for running once without the use of booleans. I decided I needed booleans but not a lot of variables since that would be messy.</p>

<p>So let's say I have this:</p>

<pre><code>var counter = 0;

$(function() {
    $('#typing').keyup(function() {
        switch($(this).val().toLowerCase()) {
          case 'test':
            // DO THIS EVERYTIME TEST CASE IS CALLED
            $('#test').fadeOut(""fast"", function() {
                $(this).html(""&lt;span class='green'&gt;That's correct!&lt;/span&gt;"").fadeIn(""fast"");
            });

            // DO THIS ONCE AND ONLY ONCE
            count++;
        }
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>Basically, it's part of 'percent complete' application where a user tries to type all cases I make available. So if a user types test twice... on the first run of case <code>test</code> it would add 1 to the counter but on the SECOND run of case <code>test</code> it would NOT add to counter.</p>

<p>I don't want to make it to add a lot of booleans for each case because that would be messy.</p>

<p>Get it? :)</p>

<p><strong>My idea</strong> is to make an array and per each case that I add it would add alltogther. So array[0] would be case <code>test</code>. Then I on my first try I would set array[0] to 1.. then create a FOR-LOOP on each case array to add up for total. This is a good idea?</p>

<p>The only problem is I don't know how to make a per case array.</p>
","70393","","<p>A simple way would be to use an object literal as the counter variable, and once a case is hit assign the value <code>true</code>:</p>

<pre><code>var counter = {};
...
case 'test' : counter[$(this).val()] = true;
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, check if the 'case' has already been stored in a plain old boring array:</p>

...
case 'test' :
if(!$.inArray($(this).val(), counter)) {
    counter.push($(this).val());

"<p>I am using jQuery events like mouseover and mouseout.</p>

<p>When a user fires the mouseover on the target element, this element receives a new class (with removeClass and addClass).</p>

<p>Then, when the mouse gets out, mouseout is fired, but the selector of the element having the mouseout event doesn't match anymore, because I changed the class.</p>

<p>Example :</p>

<pre><code>$('span.project_unsel').mouseover(function() {
    $(this).removeClass('project_unsel');
    $(this).addClass('project_sel');
});
</code></pre>

<p>After firing the above event, class has changed and the following doesn't get fired.</p>

<pre><code>$('span.project_sel').mouseout(function() {
    $(this).removeClass('project_sel');
    $(this).addClass('project_unsel');
});
</code></pre>

<p>How can I tell jQuery to ""update"" or ""bind"" again too understand this ?</p>

<p>Many thanks !</p>
","70393","","<p>I would suggest doing something like this instead, to makes things less confusing:</p>

<pre><code>$('span.project').hover(function() {
    $(this).addClass('selected');
}, function() {
    $(this).removeClass('selected');
});
</code></pre>

<p>That is, bind <code>.hover</code> to elements with the class <code>.project</code>, and simply add and remove the <code>.selected</code> class when the mouseenter (first argument) and mouseleave (second argument) events are triggered.</p>

<p>Variables are initialized at the very start of the script, yet half of my var_dumps return NULL</p>

<p>Why?</p>
","70393","","<p>To access those variables from within the function (without passing them in as arguments) you will need to use the <code>global</code> keyword to tell PHP that they have been declared in the global scope:</p>

<pre><code>function addSponsor()
{
    global $name, $url, $active;
    var_dump($name);
    var_dump($url);

    var_dump($name);
    var_dump($url);
    var_dump($active);

<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4221269/the-index-value-of-attribute"">the index value of attribute</a></p>
","70393","","<p>Suppose all of your IDs begin with the word 'popup_', (popup_1,popup_2 etc.), then you could use the <a href=""http://api.jquery.com/attribute-starts-with-selector/"" rel=""nofollow"">Attribute Starts With</a> selector like this:</p>

    'type'    : 'iframe',
    'titlePosition'  : 'outside',
    'content'  : 'testl'

","70393","","<p>Based on your current code, the most straightforward way would be to set $.ajax's <code>async</code> option to false, to force a synchronous request, causing JavaScript to wait for it to complete before continuing to execute the subsequent statements (it won't do this for <em>asynchronous</em> requests).</p>

<pre><code>$.ajax(
   {
    type: 'POST',
    async: false,
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>That will block your browser for the duration of each request (yuck). Another way to do it would be to redesign your application such that the next ajax call is called from within the success callback of the first, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>$.ajax(
   {
    type: 'POST',
    ...
    success: function() {
        doAjaxThingie();

"<p>is it possible to read an attribute from a form element?</p>

<p>I got this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input class=""number required"" min=""1250"" max=""999999999"" id=""insert_counter1"" name=""my_counter"" value="""" type=""text""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>After submit I can access the value. But is there any way to get to the other attributes like ""min"" or ""max""?</p>

<p>Right now I have a hidden readonly input field named my_counter_min where the ""min"" attribute is stored. I do not know if that is a work-a-round or if it actually is the only way to do it.</p>

<p>Br. Anders</p>

<p><strong>UPDATED based on answers below:</strong></p>

<p>Thanks for good feedback. As I read the answers there are three good solution with some pros and cons.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Store value in input type=hidden</em>. Easy to do, but can be tampered with</li>
<li><em>Use parser</em>. Takes more time to code but original value will be fetched through a new web request. So no tampering</li>
<li><em>Store value in DB</em>. If the form is related to a specific rcord in the DB then storing extra values can make good sence and will not cost a lot of coding effort if other values have to go into and out of the DB allready (just add a value).</li>
</ul>

<p>I got three different answers for my question. Fastest answer marked correct even though there are more than this one solution.</p>

"<p>I have some jquery that works fine, but I'd like to highly optimize it. Basically I'm
doing standard appending list items to unordered lists. Can anyone recommend the fastest
way to optimise the following code e.g. createDocumentFragment ?</p>

<pre><code>for (key in data) {
     li = $('&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=""item""&gt;' + data[key][""Name""] + '&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=' +   options.deleteIcon + ' alt=""remove"" class=""delete""/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;');
     $('.item', li).data('ID', data[key][""Id""]);
     $(list).append(li);
}
</code></pre>
","70393","","<p>I would suggest reducing the number of writes to the DOM to just one. By that, I mean storing the list into a temporary variable and then appending the entire list in a single operation. Also, instead of using <code>.attr</code> to set the ID of each element, you can use concatenation as you have used it to set the text of each LI.</p>

<pre><code>var tmpList = '';
for (key in data) {
     li = '&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=""item"" id=""' + data[key]['Id'] + '""&gt;' + data[key][""Name""] + '&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src=' +   options.deleteIcon + ' alt=""remove"" class=""delete""/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;';
     tmpList += li;
}

// if you are appending to an existing list, use append
// if you have just built one up from scratch, just use `.html`

","70393","","<p>Perhaps there form element on your broken page(s) triggering the postback that is not a text node. Try removing the second part of the condition that prevents the submit, to see what happens:</p>

    return false;

<p>I have the form above; checkboxes 01 and 03 are ticked when the page has finished loading using the code below. </p>

<p>I now need to ensure that when the value of the checkboxes change, so too does the hidden CSV field (though this could perhaps be done when the form submits?). I think that using the variables created, it should be possible to re-populate the CSV field when the form submits. ie, using selected_ids to add the ids of the checked boxes onto the end of the CSV (if they aren't already present). Can this be done?</p>

<pre>var csvValue = $('#csv-input').val();
var selected_ids = csvValue.split(',');
for (var i = 0; i &lt; selected_ids.length; i++)
{
    var selected_id = selected_ids[i];
    $('#' + selected_id).attr('checked', 'checked');
}

<p>Some kind person gave me this code in my previous question:</p>

<pre>
$(':checkbox').bind('change', function(event){
    if (this.checked == true){
      // add to hidden field
      var tempIdStr = $('#cvs-input').val();
      // if not in hidden value already
      if (tempIdStr.indexOf(this.id) > -1){
          tempIdStr += ""id,""; // or "", id"" depending on how you are seperating the ids
         $('#cvs-input').val(tempIdStr);
      }
    } else {
    // remove from hidden field
      var tempIds = $('#cvs-input').val().split(',');
      var index = tempIds.indexOf(this.id);
      if (index > -1){
          tempIds.splice(index, 1);
          $('#cvs-input').val(tempIds.join(',');
    }
});

"<p>I will try to explain my problem with as little code as possible.</p>

<p>Basically I have several sortable lists connected in the usual way. Each item in the list has some hidden elements that are toggled with a button on the respective items. There is also a second button that causes the list item to slideUp and be removed from the list - then being sent to a new list. This works in conjunction with an ajax call which when successful uses the .load() function to refresh the receiving sortable list.</p>

<p>The problem: When I use .load() to refresh the receiving sortable list, the new list item is present but the list loses its sort-ability and all the hidden items on each list item are displayed. Any idea why the .load() function removes the interactivity of refreshed page elements?</p>

<p>This is the code to remove an item and refresh a new list:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function click(){
$("".finished"").click(function() {

  if (confirm('Are you sure  is complete?')) {

  $(this).closest("".card"").slideUp();

  var id = $(this).closest("".card"").find("".hiddenid"").val();
  var machinequantity = $(this).closest("".card"").find("".machinequantity"").val();

  $.ajax({

       url: ""update_item_machine_complete.php"",
       type: ""POST"",
       data: ""&amp;id=""+id+""&amp;machinequantity=""+machinequantity,        
       success: function() {
                           $('#complete').load('index.php #sortable4')         
                           }
     });

    }
  });
});
</code></pre>

<p>Here's an example of the receiving list:</p>

<pre><code>            &lt;div id=""complete"" class=""box""&gt;
    &lt;ul id=""sortable4"" class=""sortable""&gt;
    &lt;li class=""notsortable""&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Complete&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;?php

include(""php/database_connect.php"");


$result = mysql_query(""SELECT * FROM orders WHERE misc='complete' ORDER BY columnpos   ASC "");

while($row = mysql_fetch_array($result))

              {
         echo'  

        &lt;li id=""id_' . $row['id'] . '""&gt;
         &lt;div class=""card""&gt;
         &lt;table&gt;
         &lt;tr&gt;
         &lt;td class=""left""&gt;' . $row['customer'] . '&lt;/td&gt;
         &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
         &lt;td class=""right""&gt;' . $row['ponumber'] . '&lt;/td&gt;
         &lt;/tr&gt;
         &lt;tr&gt;
         &lt;td class=""left""&gt;' . $row['partnumber'] . '&lt;/td&gt;
         &lt;td&gt;&lt;div class=""show""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
         &lt;td class=""right""&gt;' . $row['quantity'] . ' x Black&lt;/td&gt;
         &lt;/tr&gt;
         &lt;/table&gt;
         &lt;div class=""hide""&gt;
         &lt;p&gt;Quantity Done: &lt;span&gt;&lt;input class=""machinequantity"" type=""text"" value=""' . $row['quantity'] . '"" /&gt;&lt;input type=""submit"" value=""update"" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/fieldset&gt;

","70393","","<p>That's because your hidden fields have duplicate IDs, so jQuery only returns the first in the set. Give them classes instead, like <code>.uid</code> and grab them via:</p>

<pre><code>var uids = $("".uid"").map(function() {
    return this.value;
}).get();
</code></pre>

<p>Demo: <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/karim79/FtcnJ/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsfiddle.net/karim79/FtcnJ/</a></p>

<pre><code>&lt;fieldset&gt;&lt;legend&gt;John Smith&lt;/legend&gt;
&lt;img src='foo.jpg'/&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href=""#"" class=""aaf""&gt;add as friend&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;input name=""uid"" type=""hidden"" value='&lt;?php echo $row-&gt;uid;?&gt;' class=""uid""&gt;
&lt;/fieldset&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You can target the 'uid' relative to the clicked anchor like this:</p>

<pre><code>$(""a.aaf"").click(function() {
    alert($(this).next('.uid').val());
});
</code></pre>

<p>Important: do not have any duplicate IDs. They will cause problems. They are <em>invalid</em>, <em>bad</em> and you should <em>not</em> do it.</p>

<p>In this scenario, i can simple write a metric script to store information like ip and time, but <em>i don't know how to <strong>echo</strong> the image in order to show it on the browser.</em> I think that maybe if i open the image in binary mode from the PHP script and then stream that information to the user it will work, but in this area i know nothing.</p>

"<p>I have a flashy page with image rotators in the front end for the clients.</p>

<p>For back-end I want to have different layout. Can i have multiple layout? </p>

<p>A little hint would be appreciable</p>
","70393","","<p>I create a layout plugin, to switch layouts when a non-default module is called:</p>

<pre><code>class MyApplication_Layout_Controller_Plugin_Layout extends Zend_Layout_Controller_Plugin_Layout
{

    public function preDispatch(Zend_Controller_Request_Abstract $request)
    {
        switch ($request-&gt;getModuleName()) {
            case 'admin': $this-&gt;_moduleChange('admin');
        }
    }

    protected function _moduleChange($moduleName) {
        $this-&gt;getLayout()-&gt;setLayoutPath(
            dirname(dirname(
                $this-&gt;getLayout()-&gt;getLayoutPath()
            ))
            . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR . 'layouts/scripts/' . $moduleName
        );
        $this-&gt;getLayout()-&gt;setLayout($moduleName);
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>Then in my Bootstrap, I do this:</p>

<pre><code>Zend_Layout::startMvc(
            array(
                'layoutPath' =&gt; self::$root . '/application/views/layouts/scripts',

                'pluginClass' =&gt; 'MyApplication_Layout_Controller_Plugin_Layout'
            )
        );
</code></pre>

<p>The non-default layouts go inside a folder named after the module, so my directory structure looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>/path/to/application/views/layouts/scripts/layout.phtml --&gt; default layout

/path/to/application/views/layouts/scripts/admin/admin.phtml --&gt; admin layout

After one full working day of messing around yet-again with the documentation, tutorials, and whatever other resources I could get my hands on, I gave up (again) and an hour later my form was ready complete with client and server side validation and filtering, using the slighty more intuitive <code>Zend_Filter_Input</code> interface, and jQuery. The only thing 'fancy' I used in the view in which the form appeared was the view helpers, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php echo $this-&gt;formText('username', isset($this-&gt;input) ? $this-&gt;input-&gt;username : '', array('size' =&gt; 32)) ?&gt;

"<p>OK, I have Google maps setup in a jQuery app. (V3).  I can geocode maps all day long.</p>

<p>So, I thought I'd be smart and move the actual geocode function into, well, a function.</p>

<p>Here is the function I am using:</p>

<pre>

    function geocode(address) {
        var self = this;
        geocoder.geocode( { 'address': address }, function(results, status) {
            console.log(status);
            if (status == google.maps.GeocoderStatus.OK) {
                return results[0].geometry.location;
            } else { return null; }
        });
        return ""WTF?"";
    }
</pre>

<p>The ""WTF"" is a joke that you will see in a moment.</p>

<p>Now, later on in my code, I try to call the function like so:</p>

<pre>
var start_latlng;
start_latlng = geocode(start_address);

console.log(start_latlng);
</pre>

<p>What I get in the console is:</p>

<pre>
WTF?
OK
</pre>

<p>Notice the ""WTF"" is BEFORE the ""OK"" even though I print the ""OK"" within the function.  (the console.log(status) )</p>

<p>My guess is because the geocoding needs a little time to return and the function continues on before returning the first geocoded value.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any suggestions on how to improve this so that my ""start_latlng"" contains the expected values?</p>

<p>Thanks for any pointers.</p>

<p><em>*</em> EDIT **</p>

<p>Here is what I ended up doing.</p>

<p>I call the function like so:</p>

<pre>
        geocode(start_address, function(data) {
            start_latlng = data;
            console.log(start_latlng);          
        });
</pre>

<p>And here is the new function (not finished but you get the idea)</p>

<pre>
    function geocode(address, callback) {
        geocoder.geocode( { 'address': address }, function(results, status) {
            if (status == google.maps.GeocoderStatus.OK) {
                callback(results[0].geometry.location);
            }
            else {
                callback(""Error"");
            }
        });
    }
</pre>

<p>Works like a charm.  :-)</p>

<p>Thanks for the tips and helping me <em>think</em> better.</p>
","70393","","<p>The geocoder appears to be working asynchronously, so the result is not surprising. What I mean is, execution flows past the point of the geocoder invocation, thus the function returns and subsequently the geocoder returns its result - which is why you get the output in that order.</p>

"<p>My actual implementation of this is much more complicated, with authentication and a bunch of other stuff, but at the simplest form, here's the problem I'm having. Redirecting with header doesn't reveal itself as a referer.</p>

<p>So, let's say I have three pages: start.php, middle.php and end.php</p>

<p>start.php</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;
&lt;a href=""middle.php""&gt;middle&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;

<p>middle.php</p>

<p>end.php</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
    echo 'The referer is: ' . $_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER'];
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>When you follow the link, you end up at end.php, but the referer is not middle.php. Is there any other redirection method I can use to correct this, or anything else I can do?</p>

<p>Cheers</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>
In this case, the destination page is a third party vendor. The only method they have to validate is from refering URL. I have no control over that. I just need my page that does the redirect to send the proper URL. Are there any alternatives to this redirection method, rather than picking apart the reasons not to trust http_referer?</p>
","70393","","<p>I would suggest something like this:</p>

<pre><code>header('Location: end.php?from=' . urlencode($_SERVER['PHP_SELF'));

<pre><code>echo 'redirected from ' . urldecode($_GET['from']);

"<p>If an element is removed from the page, does it automatically unbind? Or is this a scenario in which one ought to unbind using jquery's unbind?</p>

<p>I assume it's done automatically...</p>
","70393","","<p>If you remove elements using <a href=""http://api.jquery.com/remove/"" rel=""nofollow""><code>remove</code></a> or <a href=""http://api.jquery.com/empty/"" rel=""nofollow""><code>empty</code></a>, event handlers will automatically be removed in order to prevent memory leaks. Otherwise they will remain, unless they are explicitly unbinded prior to removing those elements.</p>

<p>EDIT: Turns out <code>.html</code> will remove event handlers too, by calling an internal <code>.cleanData</code> method (declared on line 5177). You can check this in the <a href=""http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.4.4.js"" rel=""nofollow"">source</a>:</p>

<pre><code>html: function( value ) {
   ...

    for ( var i = 0, l = this.length; i &lt; l; i++ ) {
                    // Remove element nodes and prevent memory leaks
                   if ( this[i].nodeType === 1 ) {
                       jQuery.cleanData( this[i].getElementsByTagName(""*"") );
                       this[i].innerHTML = value;
                    }
                }

"<p>I want to generate this complex WHERE clause in Zend_Db:</p>

<pre><code>$select-&gt;from('product');
$select-&gt;where('status = ?', $status);
$select-&gt;where('attribute = ?', $a1);
$select-&gt;orWhere('attribute = ?', $a2);

WHERE 
    (status = 'active') 
    AND 
    (attribute = 'one') 
    OR 
    (attribute = 'two')
;

<p>I did figure out one method of making this work but I felt it was sort of 'cheating' by using PHP to combine the ""OR"" clauses first and then combine them using Zend_Db where() clause.  PHP code:</p>

<pre><code>$WHERE = array();
foreach($attributes as $a):
    #WHERE[] = ""attribute = '"" . $a . ""'"";
endforeach;
$WHERE = implode(' OR ', $WHERE);

$select-&gt;from('product');
$select-&gt;where('status = ?', $status);
$select-&gt;where($WHERE);

<p>That produced what I was looking for.   But I'm curious if there's an ""official"" way of getting that complex WHERE statement (which really isn't too complex, just adding some parenthesis) with using the Zend_Db tool, instead of combining it in PHP first.</p>

<p>Basically I'm using embed.ly for my site, so when a user fills in a form, the youtube/flickr links automatically appear where he created them. The problem I'm having is that the thumbnail for the youtube video appears to be too large, and does not toggle properly (i.e. I want the user to click on the thumbnail for the video to show up).
(So, for example if the user clicks on the dolar link, the youtube video should appear below it, like it does in the embed.ly samples).</p>

<p>I'm using php on the server side with php markdown.</p>

<p>The query code for embedly is below:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;

$(document).ready(function() {
  $(""a"").embedly({}, function(oembed, dict){
    if ( oembed == null)
      alert(""no embedly content found"");    
    var output = ""&lt;a class='embedly' href='#'&gt;&lt;img src='""+oembed.thumbnail_url+""' /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;""+oembed.title+""&lt;/span&gt;"";
    output += oembed['code'];
    $(dict[""node""]).parent().html( output );
  });
  var anchors = $(""a"");  anchors.embedly();  anchors.filter(""[href*=flx.me]"").addClass(""googlenl"");
  $('a.embedly').live(""click"", function(e){
    e.preventDefault();
    $(this).parents('li').find('.embed').toggle();
  });
});
&lt;/script&gt;

"<p>Is it the process of doing the binding, or the having many things bound that's the primarily issue of binding more events than necessary?</p>

<p>The answer's probably both, but to what extent?</p>

<p>Also, I would assume that mouseover events are more expensive than click events, since they have to be checked for more frequently. Right?</p>
","70393","","<p>The binding of events does take time, so if you bind say, a hundred or more events, user interaction with the browser will be 'uneventful' during the time spent binding all of those events.</p>

<p>The more event handlers on the page, the longer the <em>event queue</em>, the slower the UI.</p>

<p>@Juan nicely summarises event delegation in a single sentence in his answer, as an alternative to binding events to many child elements.</p>

&lt;button&gt;Test 2&lt;/button&gt;

<p>so something like this:</p>

","70393","","<p>Just to add, another option would be to use <code>$.ajax</code>, and set the <code>context</code> option to <code>this</code>, making the clicked button the context for the success callback:</p>

"<p>I'm putting together a fixed, one-page site that deploys an overlay using jQuery. There are two elements that make up the overlay:</p>

<ul>
<li>#transparent-overlay - a div that covers the entire browser window</li>
<li>#about-wrapper - a pop-up div displayed in the centre of the browser window, containing text</li>
</ul>

<p>Both of these divs are hidden on page load and have opacity: 0.</p>

<p>These two lines of jQuery switch on the overlay:</p>

<pre><code>$('#transparent-overlay').show().fadeTo(200, 0.5);
$('#about-wrapper').delay(200).show().fadeTo(170, 1.0);
</code></pre>

<p>I currently can't work out how to put together the jQuery that will switch off the overlay - i.e., return these elements to the state they were in on page load - anyone got any ideas?</p>

<p><strong>Edit following Karim's suggestion below:</strong></p>

<p>The .js file now reads as follows:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function() {
   about_click();
   about_close();
 });

function about_click() {
   $('#about').click( function() { 
      $('#transparent-overlay').show().fadeTo(200, 0.5);
      $('#about-wrapper').delay(200).show().fadeTo(170, 1.0);
   }); 
}

function about_close() {
   $('#about-close').click( function() {
      $('#about-wrapper').hide();
      $('#transparent-overlay').fadeOut(200);
   });
}
</code></pre>

<p>This loads the overlay perfectly, and then hides it perfectly. However, when I go to re-load the overlay, both #about-wrapper and #transparent-overlay snap back in to place rather than - in the case of #transparent-overlay - fading in.</p>

<p>What's the best way to go about fixing this, please?</p>
","70393","","<p>If you like, you can use custom events to encapsulate the hiding/revealing of your overlay, and then trigger them using controls on your page. For example:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).bind(""overlay-reveal"", function() {
    $('#transparent-overlay').show().fadeTo(200, 0.5);
    $('#about-wrapper').delay(200).show().fadeTo(170, 1.0);
}).bind(""overlay-close"", function() {
    $('#about-wrapper').hide();
    $('#transparent-overlay').fadeOut(200);
});

$("".closeOverlay"").click(function() {
    $(document).trigger(""overlay-close"");
});

$("".showOverlay"").click(function() {
    $(document).trigger(""overlay-reveal"");
});

"<p>The title pretty much says it all.  If I include the <a href=""http://www.asual.com/jquery/address/"" rel=""nofollow"">Asual Address plugin</a>  for jQuery in my project IE6 warns the user about ""both secure and nonsecure items"".  I've stripped a page down to nothing but:</p>

&lt;/body&gt;

<p>Any help is appreciated.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: I've tried Fiddler to determine where the nonsecure item is coming from.  The only three things listed are:</p>

<pre><code>200   HTTPS   CONNECT         *websiteurl*:443

200   HTTPS   *websiteurl*    /js/jquery.address-1.3.min.js

<p>The difference comes if I click ""No"" to loading the nonsecure items. I get</p>

"<p>Hi i am new to jQuery and was drawn by much of enthusiasm to learn it. But the problem in very first stage inhibits me from proceeding :(</p>

<p>this is my code</p>

{
jQuery("".someclass"").css(""border"",""1px solid red"");
jQuery(""#si"").html(""so bold""); // (inside bold tags, cuz this editor s processing the      bold tag in my text )
}
)

<p>But i dont find any response here. can anyone tell me what is wrong in this code. </p>
","70393","","<p>Try this inside your <code>$(document).ready(function()</code>:</p>

"<p>What's the equivalent of <code>getElementsByTagName()</code> in jQuery? I just want to create a collection of elements in jquery so I can iterate through them and do something with each item...</p>

<p>Many thanks</p>

<p>So:</p>

<pre><code>$(""div"").each(function() {

    $(this).css(""border"", ""1px solid red"");

    // do something by directly manipulating the wrapped DOM element
    this.style.border = ""1px solid red"";

    // do something only if this particular div has a class of 'pretty'
    if($(this).hasClass(""pretty"")) {
        $(this).text(""I am the pretty one"");
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>or just:</p>

<pre><code>// apply some css to all div elements
$(""div"").css(""border"", ""1px solid red"");
</code></pre>

<p>Keep in mind that when you use jQuery to select a number of elements, e.g. <code>$(""span"")</code>, any method you invoke on the object will happen on <em>all matched elements</em>. Think of it as 'implicit iteration' - e.g. <code>$(""span"").hide();</code> will hide all span elements on the page.</p>

"<p>So I know that one of the downsides of using <code>jQuery.live</code> is the unavailability of <code>.stopPropagation()</code>. But I need it badly.</p>

<p>Here's my use case. I have a checkbox is that is currently bound to a click. However, other checkboxes appear on-screen via an AJAX call, meaning I really need <code>.live('click', fn)</code>. Unfortunately, the checkbox is situated atop another clickable element, requiring <code>.stopPropagation()</code>. This works fine with <code>.bind('click', fn)</code>, but the inability to use it with <code>.live()</code> is hampering me. Using <code>return false</code> doesn't work as the checkbox will not be checked.</p>

<p>Any ideas on how to mimic <code>.stopPropagation()</code> when using <code>.live()</code> without returning false?</p>
","70393","","<p>Instead of binding a <code>.live</code> handler to the checkboxes, bind a smarter event handler to the container, with behaviour dependent on <em>which</em> element is the <em>target</em> of the event.</p>

<pre><code>$(""#container"").click(function(e) {
    var ele = e.target;
    if(ele.tagName.toLowerCase() == 'input' 
        &amp;&amp; ele.type.toLowerCase() == 'checkbox') {
        e.stopPropagation();
        // do something special for contained checkboxes
        // e.g.:
        var val = $(ele).val();
    }

<p>In any case, if the key areas of the form are not 'filled up' when they're submitted, there's a PHP check which takes you to /iefail.php and lets you know.</p>

"<p>I'm wondering if anyone is aware of a plugin or a tutorial on how to trigger a tooltip after an ajax call. At the moment I'm using <a href=""http://jquerytools.org/demos/tooltip/any-html.html"" rel=""nofollow"">jQuery Tools</a> to create the tooltips. But I don't want the tooltips to trigger on a mouseOver event; rather, I want them to show after an ajax call. I can't find any documentation or examples on how to achieve this. For example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a class=""vote""&gt;Vote&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;div id=""tooltip""&gt;
Some tooltip with a message.
&lt;/div&gt;

$.ajax({
    context: this,
    dataType: 'json',
    success: function(response) {
        if (response.result == ""success"") {
// SHOW TOOL TIP HERE
        } 
        else {
// SHOW ANOTHER TOOL TIP HERE
            }
        });
</code></pre>

<p>The way jQuery Tools works is by simply binding the element to the tool tip as such: (but this causes the tooltip to open on mouseOver)</p>

<pre><code>$(""#myElement"").tooltip();
</code></pre>

<p>There is an API with events included in jQuery tools, but I have no clue how to only show the tooltip after the Ajax! Another complicating factor is the I need to have the same tooltip (or multiple tooltips) appear on multiple elements.</p>

<p>What gives?</p>
","70393","","<p>Use a POST request instead! GET request sizes are limited by browsers, web servers and who knows what else, from anything between about 256 characters to 4000. So generally, it is unreliable to send massive amounts of data through an ordinary GET. Submit that using POST, through a HTML form, and you should not face any problems.</p>

"<p>I would like to send a couple of arrays to my php with jquery and json, how do i do that?</p>

<p>Im working with:</p>

{
url: ""script.php"",
type: ""POST"",
data: ???,
dataType: ""html"",
success: function(tablehtml){
alert(tablehtml);
}
});
</code></pre>

<p>Typical i want to send along two arrays, and the php site would then produce a html table.</p>

<p>For instance: i want information about the users <code>[""Tim"", ""Alan"", ""Kate""]</code> for the months <code>[""June"", ""July"", ""August""]</code></p>

<p>I expect to json_decode in my php script, but how to i pack and send the two arrays? :D</p>
","70393","","<p>You don't necessarily need to decode json on the server side. Suppose you have:</p>

<pre><code>var months = [""June"", ""July"", ""August""];
var names = [""Tim"", ""Alan"", ""Kate""];
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can use <a href=""http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.param/"" rel=""nofollow"">$.param</a> to create a serialized representation of them, suitable for sending as a query string, like this:</p>

<pre><code>$.ajax(
{
    url: ""script.php"",
    type: ""POST"",
    data: $.param( { names: names, months: months } ),
    dataType: ""html"",
    success: function(tablehtml){
        alert(tablehtml);
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>From PHP, what you'll see is two arrays with keys 'months' and 'names', so, for instance, you can loop over them like this:</p>

<pre><code>foreach($_POST['names'] as $name) {
    echo 'Name is: ' . $name . '&lt;br /&gt;'; 
}

Additionally, <code>.ready</code> can only be called on a jQuery object matching the current document.</p>

<p>This is not what I want, however :)</p>

<p>How can I achieve this <code>.ready</code> type of functionality for data loaded via AJAX after <code>.ready</code> has already fired, in a cross-browser compliant manner?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>
Here's a very simplified example.  I do have a problem I'm trying to solve, but I'm more interested in understanding the way to do this properly.</p>

<p>Basically, the .ready function in ajaxPage.html is firing before importantDependency.js is completely loaded, so the first load of ajaxPage, importantDependency is missing, but subsequent loads see it.</p>

<p>index.html</p>

<pre><code>...
&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
  $(document).ready(function() {
    alert(""The document is ready"");

    $('#myButton').click(function() {
      $('&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;').dialog({
        open: function () {
          $(this).load('ajaxPage.html');
        }
      });
    });
  });
&lt;/script&gt;
...
</code></pre>

<p>ajaxPage.html</p>

<pre><code>...
&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""importantDependency.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
  $(document).ready() {
    $('#thing').leverageImportantDependency();
  });
&lt;/script&gt;
...
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong>
I want to do this <em>FROM</em> the loaded content, not from the page calling the content.  Modifying the calling page means duplicating code in every instance where this is called.  I'd like the behavior to be attached to the content, not the page calling it.</p>
","70393","","<p>Generally, you will want to do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>$(""#container"").load(function(html) {
    // container has been filled up, and is 
    // ready for JS processing
    doSomethingWithNewContent();
});
</code></pre>

<p>That is to say, fire off something <em>once</em> the content has been replaced, by utilizing the appropriate ajax callback. Other examples include:</p>

<pre><code>$.get(""foo.html"", function(html) {
    $(""#container"").html(html);
    $(""#container"").find("".foo"").fancyThing();
});

$.ajax({ 
      url: 'foo.html',
      type: 'post',
      success: function(html) {
                   $(""#container"").html(html).find("".foo"").hide();
               }
     });
</code></pre>

","70393","","<p>Since you are already using jQuery, you should start refactoring that to be more readable and therefore more maintainable. Notably, you can ditch that load function, and incorporate a pattern similar to this:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function() {

    // &lt;a class=""help"" href=""help.html""&gt;help&lt;/a&gt;
    $(""a.help"").live(""click"", function() {

                $(""#divHowTo"").html(html)
                    .animate({""height"": ""toggle""}, { duration: 800 });

    $.post( $(this).attr('action'), $(this).serialize(),

<li>Bind an onsubmit event handler to the contact form. Prevent the 'normal' submit.</li>

<p>console always tells me that the width and height of the image is 0.</p>
","70393","","<p>In one place you are using <code>$(this).attr('width');</code>, whereas in another you are using <code>$(this).width()</code>. Try <code>.width()</code> and <code>.height()</code>, which I believe are the ones you should be using, in both places:</p>

<pre><code>$("".post-body img"").each(function() {

            $(this).height(Math.round(newHeight));            
        }
});
</code></pre>

<p>Also (perhaps not relevant) shouldn't you be setting the data width and height attributes for each image after you change their dimensions?</p>

<pre><code>$("".post-body img"").each(function() {   
        if (bw &lt; $(this).data('width')) {
            $(this).width(Math.round(bw));
            //calculate ratio height
            var newHeight = (bw / $(this).data('width')) * $(this).data('height');
            $(this).height(Math.round(newHeight));
            $(this).data(""width"", Math.round(bw));
            $(this).data(""height"", newHeight);
        }
});

<p>And finally, I hope you are storing the image dimensions onload as @Emmett suggested in his comment:</p>

<pre><code>$("".post-body img"").load(function() {  
    $(this).data('width', $(this).width());
    $(this).data('height', $(this).height());
});

<p>Remember that <code>width()</code> and <code>height()</code> return the actual content width and height, regardless of CSS properties, so those values should only be captured once the content/images or whatever have been fully loaded.</p>

"<p>I'm trying to create something in jQuery and having a bit of problems with it. I'm not too adept on the framework, so I'm sure this is all wrong. </p>

<p>Anyways, the ultimate goal is a full form that contains 3 radio buttons - depending on the value of the button, a LI is shown. I have all of that done, but my problem is coming with validation. If something fails then the page is reloaded and the div that was selected doesn't show without clicking another radio first, then back to the original. This process is basically the same as someone came up with here. </p>

<p>Here's what I got so far. </p>

<p><strong>HTML</strong></p>

<pre><code> &lt;li&gt; &lt;label&gt; License (radio) &lt;/label&gt;
 &lt;label for=""commercial"" class=""checkBox""&gt; Commercial &lt;/label&gt; 
     &lt;input type=""radio"" name=""license"" value=""commercial"" id=""commercial"" class=""checkBox"" &lt;?php echo set_radio('license', 'commercial'); ?&gt; /&gt;
    &lt;label for=""abandonware"" class=""checkBox""&gt; Abandonware &lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;input type=""radio"" name=""license"" value=""abandonware"" id=""abandonware"" class=""checkBox"" &lt;?php echo set_radio('license', 'abandonware'); ?&gt; /&gt;
    &lt;label for=""freeware"" class=""checkBox""&gt; Freeware &lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;input type=""radio"" name=""license"" value=""freeware"" id=""freeware"" class=""checkBox"" &lt;?php echo set_radio('license', 'freeware'); ?&gt; /&gt;
   &lt;/li&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This is followed by three LI's that contain id=""commercial, abandonware, and freeware"" and class=""licenseli""</p>

<p>My jQuery is, as said, something from here. </p>

<pre><code> $('li.licenseli').hide();
    $('input[name=license]:radio').change(function(){
    var Type = $(this).val(); // Get value of radio
    $('li.licenseli').slideUp(); // Hide non-selected
    $('li#'+Type).slideDown(); // Show Selected
});
</code></pre>

<p>So what I need help with is I have a hidden input that retrieves the value of the radio box from validation - I want to take this value (or the radio's if possible?) and have the original selected option's LI already visible. </p>
","70393","","<p>Try triggering the change event on the radios once when the page has fully loaded, to correctly set the visual state of the page:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function() {
    $('li.licenseli').hide();
    $('input[name=license]:radio').change(function(){
        var Type = $(this).val(); // Get value of radio
        $('li.licenseli').slideUp(); // Hide non-selected
        $('li#'+Type).slideDown(); // Show Selected
    }).change();
});

","70393","","<p>Alternatively, try using <code>.html</code> and then <em>wrap</em> with <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> tags:</p>

"<p>I've got some thumbnails that I animate a border onto when moused over.
I use <code>hover()</code> to assign the functions when <code>document.ready()</code> is called. What I'd like is a way to disable this animation effect on the image that the user has clicked on. It has a different class. So, I was planning on doing this by making the animate function include a check to see if the thumb in question had this other class. If not, proceed; if so, do nothing.

"<p>I want this webpage to highlight certain elements when you click on one of them, but if you click anywhere else on the page, then all of these elements should no longer be highlighted. </p>

<p>I accomplished this task by the following, and it works just fine except for one thing (described below): </p>

<pre><code>$(document).click(function() {
    // Do stuff when clicking anywhere but on elements of class suggestion_box
    $("".suggestion_box"").css('background-color', '#FFFFFF');
});
$("".suggestion_box"").click(function() { 
    // means you clicked on an object belonging to class suggestion_box
    return false;
});

// the code for handling onclicks for each element
function clickSuggestion() {
    // remove all highlighting
    $("".suggestion_box"").css('background-color', '#FFFFFF');
    // then highlight only a specific item
    $(""div[name="" + arguments[0] + ""]"").css('background-color', '#CCFFCC');     
}
</code></pre>

<p>This way of enforcing the highlighting of elements works fine until I add more html to the page without having a new page load.  This is done by .append() and .prepend()</p>

<p>What I suspected from debugging was that the page is not ""aware"" of the new elements that were added to the page dynamically.  Despite the new, dynamically added elements having the appropriate class names/IDs/names/onclicks ect, they never get highlighted like the rest of the elements (which continue to work fine the entire time).   </p>

<p>I was wondering if a possible reason for why my approach does not work for the dynamically added content is that the page is not able to recognize the elements that were not present during the pageload.  And if this is a possibility, then is there a way to reconcile this without a pageload?  </p>

<p>If this line of reasoning is wrong, then the code I have above is probably not enough to show what's wrong with my webpage.  But I'm really just interested in whether or not this line of thought is a possibility.</p>

","70393","","<p>This is highly experimental (you have been warned!) and might not be a good fit to your problem or answer to this question, but it has occurred to me that you can do two things:</p>

<p>1 - Override the jQuery's core <code>.toggle</code> method to add some data to the elements it gets applied to.</p>

<p>2 - Bind a <code>changeData</code> event handler to elements, as of jQuery 1.4.4</p>

<p>What that means is, you can make something happen whenever an element gets toggled. The same principle could apply to the <code>.hide</code> and <code>.show</code> methods, or any other methods for that matter.</p>

<pre><code>// 1 - override .toggle()
var original = jQuery.fn.toggle;
jQuery.fn.toggle = function() {
    console.log(""Override method: toggle()"");

    // call the original toggle
    original.apply(this, arguments);

    // record the element's visibility
    $(this).data(""visible"", $(this).is("":visible""));

    return this;
};

// 2 - bind a changeData event handler to a 'watch list'
$('div').bind(""changeData"", function() {
    alert(""Visibility changed to: "" + $.data(this, 'visible'));
});

&lt;!-- exhaustive test markup --&gt;
&lt;div id=""test""&gt;Hello&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=""test2"" style=""display:none""&gt;Hello 2&lt;/div&gt;

Thanks.</p>
","70393","","<p>The only way to <em>reliably</em> detect a mime type is to parse the file on the server side, to confirm that it is the type that the user claims it to be, or that it fits a list of allowed types. Things to consider:</p>

<p>1 - JavaScript has limited access to the local filesystem, and with good reason.</p>

<p>2 - You cannot trust a mime type which has been received from a browser. It will not necessarily match the mime type of the sent file.</p>

<p>3 - In a situation where the user is allowed to upload files which fit a 'whitelist' of allowed types, validation is probably necessary anyway - considering that the application might have to actually do something with the file beyond storing them, which would at the very least involve parsing their headers for information such as run length (for a video) version number (for a Word document) and so on.</p>

","70393","","<p>That is redundancy at its finest. It makes little sense to have keys matching their values, and probably highlights the need for a design change, or a potential optimisation somewhere in your application. Turning this:</p>

"<p>hope you can help, </p>

<p>Prob. no need to go beyond the first 2 or 3 characters, in fact really just the first would do at the moment - so in example ""hello world"", the list might contain ""hello world,hi world,help world,a world,another world, because world ...."" </p>

<p>So if I type h as the first letter in my input all I would see in the <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> list - placed after the input field so could use <code>.next()</code> is ""hello world,hi world,help world"". </p>

<p>In your Bootsrap, you will need to incorporate something like this:</p>

<pre><code>Zend_Layout::startMvc(
    array(
        'layoutPath' =&gt; self::$root . '/application/views/layouts/scripts',

"<p>Basically I am trying to show hide divs and links, but having some trouble. The functionality required is as follows:</p>

<li>User can click the 'Selected Additional Languages' link which will show the 'additional-languages' DIV</li>
<li>At the point of clicking this link, the link will get hidden</li>
<li>User can then choose to hide the 'additional-languages' DIV by clicking on the 'hide' link</li>
<li>At the point of clicking this link, the 'Selected Additional Languages' link will re-appear</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""row""&gt;
    &lt;label for=""native_language""&gt;Select&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;select name=""native_language"" id=""native_language""&gt;
      &lt;option value=""""&gt;Any&lt;/option&gt;

    &lt;/select&gt;

    &lt;a class=""show-additional-link"" href=""#""&gt;Select Additional Languages&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=""additional-languages"" style=""display: none;""&gt;
    &lt;a class=""hide-additional-link"" href=""#""&gt;[hide]&lt;/a&gt;

    &lt;div class=""row""&gt;
        &lt;!-- additional language checkboxes --&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>JS:</p>

<pre><code>$('.show-additional-link').click(function(){
    $(this).parent().next().slideDown();
    $(this).hide();
    return false;
});
</code></pre>

<p>The first part is working for me, but I'm struggling on getting the second part to work, i.e. the functionality for the 'hide-additional-link'. I have tried this:</p>

<pre><code>$('.hide-additional-link').click(function(){
    $(this).parent().slideUp();
    $(this).parent().prev('.show-additional-link').show();
    return false;
});

","70393","","<p>Change this:</p>

<pre><code>$(this).prev('.show-additional-link').show();
</code></pre>

<p>to this:</p>

<pre><code>$(this).parent().prev(""div.row"").find('.show-additional-link').show();
</code></pre>

<p><code>.prev</code> will target, strictly, the immediately previous sibling. Your <code>.show-additional-link</code> button is a child of the previous div, so basically you need to go up one level, get the previous div, and find the <code>.show-additional-link</code> descendant.</p>

"<p>Hi everyone (first post!). I'm a JQuery and Javascript newbie.</p>

<p>I'm working on the following website: http://www.beautifulinteractions.com/lombo/</p>

<p>I made a custom .js file with my own functions calling JQuery selectors and methods. I call the startup() function from  tag and two divs (the menu and and footer) come in in the proper way.</p>

<p>However, the first time (and only the first) I click on a menu element (triggering a .show() call via onclick=""javascript:showContent(URL)"") the target div gets visibile but does not fade in - it just appears. Every other time I click on a menu item the animation works fine.</p>

function startup() {
    $('#hiddenMenu').show(millis, foo());

"<p>I've working on a site that was written using Prototype but we're phasing it to jQuery.  A lot of page updates are done via Prototype's Ajax.Updater. However, sometimes the elements that Prototype removes and replaces have had a jQuery widget run on them, so $.cache has references to the additional elements created by the widget.  Since jQuery isn't doing the DOM removal, it doesn't have a chance to clear the data from $.cache for those elements when they are removed, and I end up with a memory leak.  Is there a way to tell jQuery to check it's $.cache and discard any data for elements that are no longer in the DOM?</p>
","70393","","<p>Sounds a little tricky - particularly since Ajax.Updater is a specialisation of Ajax.Request which does <em>not</em> have an onsuccess/oncomplete callback, meaning that you will probably have to do a periodical check of the cache, among other things.

"<p>Hy,</p>

<p>a really stupid problem, but i cant get it to work:</p>

<p>I have some function that binds the click of my navigation. When a link is clicker it gets the class ""active"". So my idea was that i just say:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a id=""link1"" class=""main""&gt;link1&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a id=""link2"" class=""main""&gt;link2&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a id=""link3"" class=""main""&gt;link3&lt;/a&gt;

$('a.main').bind('click', function(){
$(this).removeClass('active');
//some code
$(this).addClass('active');
}
</code></pre>

<p>So far thats working. My element gets the active class when it´s hit and removes when another has been clicked. My idea now was just simple unbind all active links (otherwise some double reloading happends by paranoid 10000 clicks on my navigation =)</p>

<pre><code>§('a.active').unbind('click');
</code></pre>

<p>I also specify for each element in my navigation a special event:</p>

<pre><code>$('a#link1').bind('click', function() {
$img.fadeOut('slow', function() {
      $('#bg div table tr td').addClass('loading');
        $img.attr('src', 'images/image.jpg');
     });
});
</code></pre>

<p>Now what happends is, that if i click an element in my navigation (accordion), the thing slides down, gets the active class (still keeps the main class):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a id=""link1"" class=""main active""&gt;link1&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>When i click another element in the navigation, this one closes and the active class is removed.</p>

<p>BUT when i go back to that link before, it´s nnot clickable anymore? So, i guess jQuery unbinds the click event for ever from an element that has been active. Sounds a bit stupid and unlogic to me...</p>

<p>Maybe is there a way to enable/disabel these. So a function that checks if the element has an active class it should be disabled. Or is the problem the ""main"" class beside the ""active"" class...</p>

<p>Any idea?</p>
","70393","","<p>You can namespace event handlers, so you can easily unbind them without affecting other handlers of the same type attached to the same elements:</p>

<pre><code>$('a.main').bind('click.activeState', function() {
    ...
});


$('a.active').unbind('click.activeState');


// and instead of binding several times, you can use attributeStartswith
$('a[id^=link]').bind('click.animation', function() {
    ...
});

","70393","","<p>Your question is a little vague. In truth there are <a href=""http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/"" rel=""nofollow""><em>many</em> possibilities</a>. It all depends on your exact requirement.</p>

<pre><code>// link href contains 'page5'
$(""a[href*=page5]"").remove();

// links ending with page5.html
$(""a[href$=page5\\.html]"").remove();

// remove all links with some class
$("".standard_link"").remove();
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to target based on the text or html content of the link, you can do:</p>

<pre><code>$(""a.standard_link"").filter(function() {
    return $(this).text() == ""link 2"";
}).remove();

"<p>I am really hoping this is obvious and I just missed it :)</p>

<p>I have a collection of elements that I want to loop over using each, but I am looping over them inside an outer for loop. When I find what I want in the each, I return false to break out. The next time the outer loop runs, I want to start in the each at the element after the one I returned at. A generic code example:</p>

<pre><code>var nextIndex = 0;

for (var j=1; j &lt;= someCount; j++) {
    // do outside loop stuff

    $('#someElemID').find('.someClass').each(function(index) {
        if (/*this is right one*/) {
            // do something
            // next index should get passed to each function next loop... somehow?
            nextIndex = index + 1; 
            return false;
        }
    });

You would be better off following this pattern if you care about cross-browser compatibility:</p>

<ul>
<li>Get container element by ID.</li>
<li>Get needed child elements by tag name.</li>
<li>Iterate over children, test for matching className property.</li>
<li><code>elements[i].parentNode.removeChild(elements[i])</code> like the other guys said.</li>
</ul>

<p>Quick example:</p>

var len = cells.length;
for(var i = 0; i &lt; len; i++) {
    if(cells[i].className.toLowerCase() == ""column"") {

for (var i = 0; i &lt; col_wrapper.length; i++) {

}

<p>The problem was my fault; when you remove an element from the resulting array of elements, the length changes, so one element gets skipped at each iteration. The solution is to store a reference to each element in a temporary array, then subsequently loop over those, removing each one from the DOM.</p>

","70393","","<p>Use <code>.bind</code> instead. I take it that your tab content is loaded in from an ajax source? If so, then binding on the <code>tabsload</code> event will result in a new handler getting attached <em>each time the tab is loaded</em>, so it makes sense that you need to call <code>die()</code> beforehand.</p>

<p>Using <code>.bind</code> means that the click handler attached to <code>.show_comment</code> will <em>naturally</em> die when you load another tab, and will get reattached when <code>#tabs-2</code> is loaded again.</p>

","70393","","<p>Instead of chaining them after the <code>.animate</code> call, put those <code>.css</code> calls into <code>.animate</code>'s <a href=""http://api.jquery.com/animate/"">complete callback</a>. Also, you can shorten your solution by passing an object of key/value pairs to <code>.css</code>.</p>

}, 500, function() {
    $(this).css({color: '#7f3f97', backgroundImage: 'url(images/3.jpg)'});

<p>I was wondering if there is any chance to select the right DOM objects besides tagging everything using ids. </p>

<p>Thanks</p>
","70393","","<p>Capture the context into a variable, and use that within the success callback:</p>

<pre><code>$('.answerForm').live('submit', function(event) {

    $.post($(this).attr('action'), $(this).serialize(), function() {
        ...
        $(that).hide();

<p>The <code>.data('autocomplete')</code> section is the hack. Is there a way to go around this so when there is no autocomplete (no <code>#project</code> is found), it does not throw a javascript error?</p>

<p><strong>Also</strong>: When 2 autocompletes are on the page, only the first one works.</p>
","70393","","<p>Simply apply the autocompleter if <code>#project</code> exists, which can be determined by checking the <code>length</code> property of the jQuery object formed by that selector:</p>

<pre><code>if($(""#project"").length) {
    $(""#project"").autocomplete({...
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you are going to have more than one autocompleter, then you will need another selector since duplicate IDs are causing the problem of only the first one working. E.g.:</p>

<pre><code>if($("".project"").length) {
    $("".project"").autocomplete({...

"<p>I'm using the jQuery UI Autocomplete.</p>

<p>It's great, but there's a problem with multiple autocomplete boxes on the same page with multiple monkey-patched solutions to format the results (currently you can only overwrite the original renderItem allowing one result format per page).</p>

<p>How to solve this problem is one of the great unsolved mysteries (as I can find) of the Autocomplete widget. I had the idea that if I can reference the id of the auto complete element I can add an if statement in the monkey patch allowing me to create multiple instances. Let me demonstrate:</p>

<p>The monkey patch to format results is:</p>

<pre><code>$.ui.autocomplete.prototype._renderItem: function( ul, item) {
    return CUSTOMISE FORMATTING HERE;
};
</code></pre>

<p>If I specify on the same page, say:</p>

<p>$(""#input1"").autocomplete();</p>

<p>$(""#input2"").autocomplete();</p>

<p>I'm trying to achieve separate functions and had the idea of using the _RenderMenu:</p>

<pre><code>$.ui.autocomplete.prototype._renderMenu: function( ul, items ) {
    var self = this;
    $.each( items, function( index, item ) {
        self._renderItem( ul, item );
    });
};
</code></pre>

<p>by changing it to:</p>

<pre><code>$.ui.autocomplete.prototype._renderMenu: function( ul, items ) {
    var self = this;
    $.each( items, function( index, item ) {
        if ( $$$$CLASS-OR-ID$$$$ == '#input1' ) {
             self._renderItemCustom1( ul, item );
        }
        else if ( $$$$CLASS-OR-ID$$$$ == '#input2' ) {
            self._renderItemCustom2( ul, item );
        }
        else {
            self._renderItem( ul, item );
        }
    });
};
</code></pre>

<p>This should enable the configuration of multiple configurations to format the auto complete results?</p>

<p>e.g. by configuring x number custom _renderItem functions, listed within _renderMenu:</p>

<pre><code>$.ui.autocomplete.prototype._renderItemCustom1: function( ul, item) {
    return CUSTOMISE FORMATTING HERE;
};
</code></pre>

<p>So my question is, how can I reference the class or ID ($$$$CLASS-OR-ID$$$$ in the code) at the top of the chain within the _renderMenu function?</p>

<p>Hope this makes sense, thanks for your help!</p>
","70393","","<p>This might seem a bit hacky, but I honestly can't think of anything else. In short, we add a 'controlId' property to each data item. We override the <code>_renderMenu</code> method to read this property, and run its value through some conditions:</p>

<pre><code>$.ui.autocomplete.prototype._renderMenu = function(ul, items) {
    var self = this;
    $.each(items, function(index, item) {
        if (item.controlId == 'foo') {
            alert('got foo');
            self._renderItemCustom1(ul, item);
        }
        else if (item.controlId == 'bar') {
            alert('got bar');
            self._renderItemCustom2(ul, item);
        }
        else {
            self._renderItem(ul, item);
        }
    });
};

// each object should have a 'controlId' parameter
var projects = [
    {
    value: ""jquery"",

<p>My problem occurs only in IE and when try to upload an image I got the

<p>Please help me as I have no clue what to do to solve the problem</p>

","70393","","<p>IE likes to think that jpegs have the 'image/pjpeg' mime type (instead of 'image/jpeg'). That could be be the reason. I would suggest posting your implementation for <code>getExtension()</code>, or making sure that pjpeg is one of your allowed extensions.</p>

"<p>I have a site that is Ajaxed, content that is Ajax is from other pages, such as about.html, contact.html. The ajax is getting the content from a div called #main-content. But after the ajax call, rest of my scripts break. Such as the tinyscrollbar() plugin and some other custom functions. </p>

<p>I searched for about 4 days and found out that my problem was the AJAX request changing the DOM, and since scripts being loaded before that, it doesn't run after the ajax call.</p>

<p>If i'm right, what would I need to fix this? .live() or the .livequery() plugin?</p>

<p>All the JS I am using is in this:</p>

<pre><code>var $dd = $('.projects dl').find('dd'), $defBox = $('#def-box');

  $defBox.hide();
  $('.projects').hover(function(){
    $defBox.stop(true, true)
      .fadeToggle(1000)
      .html('&lt;p&gt;Hover The links to see a description&lt;/p&gt;');
  });

  $dd.hide();
  $('.projects dl dt').hover(function(){
    var $data = $(this).next('dd').html();
    $defBox.html($data);
    }); 

  // Ajax Stuff 
  // Check for hash value in URL  
  var hash = window.location.hash.substr(1);

  //  Check to ensure that a link with href == hash is on the page  
  if ($('a[href=""' + hash + '""]').length) {
    //  Load the page.
    var toLoad = hash + '.php #main-content';
    $('#main-content').load(toLoad);
  }

  $(""nav ul li a"").click(function(){
    var goingTo = $(this).attr('href');
    goingTo = goingTo.substring(goingTo.lastIndexOf('/') + 1);
    if (window.location.hash.substring(1) === goingTo) return false;

    var toLoad = $(this).attr('href')+' #main-content',
    $content = $('#main-content'), $loadimg = $('#load');

    $content.fadeOut('fast',loadContent);  
      $loadimg.remove();  
      $content.append('&lt;span id=""load""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;');  
      $loadimg.fadeIn('slow');  
    window.location.hash = goingTo;

    function loadContent() {  
        $content.load(toLoad,'',showNewContent)  
    }  
    function showNewContent() {  
        $content.fadeIn('fast',hideLoader);  
    }  
    function hideLoader() {  
        $loadimg.fadeOut('fast');  
    }  
    return false;  

  });
</code></pre>
","70393","","<p>For plugins, neither really. You can simply re-init your plugins within <code>$.load</code>'s complete callback:</p>

<pre><code>$('#main-content').load(toLoad, function() {
    $(""#foo"").tinyscrollbar();
    $(""#bar"").facebox();
    // etc
});
</code></pre>

<p>For event handlers, you can rebind them within the callback as in the above example, or use <code>.live</code> or <code>.delegate</code> (which you already seem to be using) to ensure that the binding persists for future (ajax-replaced) elements, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>$('.projects dl').delegate(""dt"", ""hover"", function() {
   ...
}, function() {
    ...
});
</code></pre>

<p>or:</p>

<pre><code>$('.projects dl dt').live(""hover"", function() {
   ...
}, function() {
    ...
});

<p>But in javascript how can I check it?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
","70393","","<p>There is no reliable way to do this without making a request to the server, since the session might have expired on the server side. In one project, I do it the following, imperfect way:</p>

<pre><code>checkAuth() {
    var logged = (function() {
        var isLogged = null;
        $.ajax({
            'async': false,
            'global': false,
            'url': '/user/isLogged/',
            'success': function(resp) {
                isLogged = (resp === ""1"");
            }
        });
        return isLogged;
    })();
    return logged;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I say imperfect because it makes a synchronous request which temporarily locks up the browser. It does have an advantage in that <code>checkAuth()</code> can be reliably called from any part of the client-side application since it forces the browser to wait for the result before continuing execution of the JS code, but that's about it.</p>

<p>The alternative, asynchronous (non-locking) approach would be to do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>$.ajax({
    'url': '/user/isLogged/',
    'success': function(resp) {

"<p>i am trying to load some data using json and jquery the problem occurs when i call data from 2 files like this:</p>

$.getJSON('json/character.json', function(data) {

});

<p>if i use only one file it works, but with both doesnt. Wired.</p>

<p>any ideas?</p>

<p>edit:
i have them like this: i have an index.php and file1.php and file2.php . </p>

<p>each file1 and file2 are included in the index.php and each file1.php and file2.php call a json file.</p>
","70393","","<p>I bet you execute them in that sequence every time. The first one works because the JSON is well-formed, the second one fails because the JSON is malformed. <code>$.getJSON</code> <a href=""http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/"" rel=""nofollow"">will fail silently</a> if it gets bad JSON from the server.</p>

"<p>How come my if statement <code>if (tablename == Character.toString('S'))</code> is not registering as true? Both print out the be S... Is there a different why I can implement this?

<pre><code>System.out.println(""Enter table:"");
String line = input.readLine();
StringTokenizer tk = new StringTokenizer(line);
String tablename = tk.nextToken();

DatabaseMetaData d = conn.getMetaData();

"<p>hey guys,
I'm using a google map with the full maps api on my website. The map is only visible and used once a specific link (e.g. Show Map) is clicked. Since this maps api is a rather large js file I want to load the api only when it's needed and not on page load like i'm doing it right now.</p>

<p>right now I have this in my </p>

<pre><code>&lt;script src=""http://maps.google.com/maps?file=api&amp;amp;v=2&amp;amp;sensor=true&amp;amp;key=ABQIAAAAnf9W..."" type=""text/javascript""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

<p>The map i only shown when i click the following item:</p>

  <li>The id attribute can act as more than    just an anchor name (e.g.,

  <li>Some older user agents don't support    anchors created with the id

<p>and the user picks ""pineapple"" I want to choose X number of additional fruits from the remaining array items.  The key thing is that ""pineapple"" can't be both the selection and also one of the additional fruits, so it needs to be excluded from the array once it's chosen as the selection.</p>

<pre><code>Selection: pineapple
Your additional fruits:  kiwi, grape, orange
</code></pre>

<p>NOT
    Selection: pineapple
    Your additional fruits:  kiwi, pineapple, grape</p>

<p>I'm actually doing this with filenames, not fruits, but it seems easier to describe this way.</p>

<p>I think I can do the random selection part, but I'm not sure how to <em>remove</em> the item that's selected from the given array in PHP.  Thanks very much for any suggestions or ideas.</p>
","70393","","<p>Another approach would be to use <a href=""http://php.net/manual/en/function.array-diff.php"" rel=""nofollow""><code>array_diff</code></a> to directly return an array which does not contain the chosen element(s), e.g.:</p>

shuffle($remainder);

// now do something with the first three from the shuffled remainder

"<p>What I need is a simple color picker (max 6-8 color) so the user can choose a color for an event that will be entered in a calendar.</p>

<p>I have tested several jQuery colopicker plugins and none have worked well in my project.</p>

<p>Either they are too complex (like Farbtastic) or are simple but don't run on the most recent version of jQuery.</p>

<p>So I decided to provide a good ol' dropdown menu with a list of colors</p>

<pre><code>&lt;select id=""evt_color""&gt; 
&lt;option value=""#3366CC""&gt;Blue&lt;/option&gt; 
&lt;option value=""#E070D6""&gt;Fuchsia&lt;/option&gt; 
&lt;option value=""#808080""&gt;Gray&lt;/option&gt; 
&lt;option value=""#4bb64f""&gt;Green&lt;/option&gt; 
&lt;option value=""#ed9d2b""&gt;Orange&lt;/option&gt; 
&lt;option value=""#FF9CB3""&gt;Pink&lt;/option&gt; 
&lt;option value=""#EA4A4A""&gt;Red&lt;/option&gt; 
&lt;/select&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This works well. But I would like to give the user some feedback on the color they choose, before submitting the form.</p>

<p>I wonder if somehow we could create a small square DIV next to the dropdown, and have its <code>background-color</code> change to the value of the selected color <code>onChange</code>, via something like <code>getElementById</code> or other method. By default, the first color would be selected (Blue).</p>

<p>Anyone have suggestions for this? jQuery or raw JS suggestions are welcome!</p>

<p>Thanks for helping!</p>

","70393","","<p>Your inner selector is incorrect. It should be:</p>

<pre><code>$(this).find(""option:selected"").length
</code></pre>

<p>You can't prepend a dom element to a selector (since they are not strings). You'll end up with a selector that looks something like ""Object objectoption:selected"" since it will implicitly call the <code>.toString()</code> method as it is being used with the dual purpose <code>+</code> operator. </p>

<pre><code>$(""ul.dropdown"").delegate(""li"", ""hover"", function() {
    $(this).addClass(""hover"");
    $('ul:first',this).css('visibility', 'visible');
}, function(){
    $(this).removeClass(""hover"");
    $('ul:first',this).css('visibility', 'hidden');
});
</code></pre>

<p><code>.live</code> pretty much does the same thing, however <code>.live</code> cannot be used in chaining - it needs to be used directly on a selector. Example:</p>

<pre><code>// won't work
$(""#foo"").children(""table"").find(""tr"").live(""click"",function() {...

// will work
$(""#foo"").children(""table"").delegate(""tr"",""click"",function() {...
</code></pre>

<p>Furthermore, <code>.live</code> attaches event handlers to the document element if no context is specified, which can significantly impact performance. This performance hit can be mitigated by explicitly specifying the context (works with jQuery 1.4 +):</p>

<pre><code>$(""li"",$(""ul.dropdown"")[0]).live(""hover"",function() {...
</code></pre>

<p>And lastly, you cannot stop the propagation of <code>.live</code> events. From the <a href=""http://api.jquery.com/delegate/"" rel=""nofollow"">docs</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since the .live() method handles
  events once they have propagated to
  the top of the document, it is not
  possible to stop propagation of live
  events. Similarly, events handled by
  .delegate() will always propagate to
  the element to which they are
  delegated; event handlers on any
  elements below it will already have
  been executed by the time the
  delegated event handler is called.</p>

"<p>I have a checkbox on a webpage that when you click it, updates the value in the database as well as the editedBy and editedDate columns in a table in the database.  I am doing the update via an ajax call to a php page.  I am trying to get the updated editedDate and editedBy data in the callback on success so i can update the sorresponding span tags that hold this information.  I'm trying to use jQuery to accomplish this.  This is what i have so far:</p>

    var project = target.attr('project');

<p>The <code>checklistpost.php</code> page takes the variables that are in the query string and posts them to the database.  It also then puts the variables in an array which is then encoded in json so that i have a json object to work with.  Basically, i am trying to take that json object that gets called back and use it to update the span as mentioned above.  When i have used an <code>alert()</code> inside of the <code>updateUserDate</code> function before to verify that i can see the variables and they all have the right data (you can see the code i used to do this is commented out).  However, whenever i try and use the variables with jQuery as you see on the 6th line of the code.  It doesn't do anything.  BTW, The jQuery code that should be output based on what is written above should look like this <code>$(""#tableName .row1 .newEditedDate"").html(""April 14, 2011 @ 5:15pm"")</code> What am i missing?

"<p>I have a mobile website and everything is working fine except for the validation. Basically I'm looking to take values from the user and then process them on a separate page (process.php). However, before doing so I need to check to make sure the fields have been populated. I have looked at several ways to do this but none seem to be working. I have the below code at the moment. When I press the process button it brings me through to the process.php splash screen even though the item field is empty. It doesn't write to the database but I would rather it didn't bring the user to the process.php screen until all mandatory fields have been filled in. Any ideas?</p>

"<p>I've got an html form that is being validated using <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation"" rel=""nofollow"">jquery validate plugin</a>. The form has 3 submit buttons.

<p>Thanks</p>
","70393","","<p>Yes, it is possible. You test the ID of the clicked submit button, and use the <code>click</code> event to perform the form submission, or the validation, depending on which button has been clicked:</p>

<pre><code>$(""#form input:submit"").click(function(e) {
    if (e.target.id == ""foo"") { // or this.id, or $(this).attr('id')

"<p>I just ran into the weirdest of bugs today. I'm not sure if it's a bug in Chrome or something that I can work around but here goes.</p>

<p>I built a JQuery function to resize a set of images that are posted on a forum:</p>

<pre><code>$("".post-message img.post-image"").load(function(){
    $(this).each(function() {
        var maxWidth = 200;     
        if($(this).width() &gt; maxWidth)
        {
            var factor = $(this).width() / maxWidth;

            $(this).css('height', height / factor);
        }       
    });

<p>The problem is that this only seems to work when I refresh the page. It doesn't work when you press previous or when you get linked to the page.</p>

<p>In chrome the <code>$(img).width()</code> property returns 0 in both cases when the function doesn't work.</p>

<p>This function performs as expected in IE9 and FF3</p>

<p>What can I do to fix this odd behavior?</p>
","70393","","<p>Most probably because the images are being pulled up from the browser cache, and the <code>load</code> event is not triggering. The way around this is to manually trigger <code>load</code> if the images's <code>complete</code> properties have been set:</p>

    $(this).each(function() {

"<p>A while ago I was making some test on javascript, 
and played with a code to get the text of all elements with a certain class,

","70393","","<p>In plain-old JavaScript you can do this:</p>

<pre><code>var inputs = document.getElementsByTagName('input');

for(var i = 0; i &lt; inputs.length; i++) {
    if(inputs[i].type.toLowerCase() == 'text') {
        alert(inputs[i].value);
    }
}

<p>In jQuery, you would just do:</p>

<pre><code>// select all inputs of type 'text' on the page
$(""input:text"")

// hide all text inputs which are descendants of div class=""foo""
$(""div.foo input:text"").hide();

"<p>I have written a script that will load a series of products into a div tag.</p>

","70393","","<p>You can test the checked state within the onchange handler, and simply invoke the onchange handler (which I believe you should be using instead of onclick) once when the page loads:</p>

","70393","","<p>The view you are rendering is HTML, so your <code>$.getJSON</code> call is fetching a bunch of HTML, and not JSON.

<p>Upon page load jQuery still focuses on the text input field, however it does not display clear class (x) but will display it only if there is at least 1 character inputed into the text field other vise it is not displayed.</p>

<li>There is no need to loop over the buttons. <code>$("".button"").click(...</code> will implicitly attach a handler to all elements with the 'button' class.</li>

"<p>I have seen a snippet like this for detecting IE in JavaScript using conditional comments.</p>

<pre><code>var ie = (function(){

    var undef, v = 3, div = document.createElement('div');

    // the while loop is used without an associated block: {}
    // so, only the condition within the () is executed.

    // semicolons arent allowed within the condition,
    //   so a comma is used to stand in for one
    // basically allowing the two separate statements 
    //   to be evaluated sequentially.

    while (
        div.innerHTML = '&lt;!--[if gt IE '+(++v)+']&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;![endif]--&gt;',
        div.getElementsByTagName('i')[0]
    );

    // each time it's evaluated, v gets incremented and
    //   tossed into the DOM as a conditional comment
    // the i element is then a child of the div.

    // the return value of the getEBTN call is used as 
    //   the final condition expression
    // if there is an i element (the IE conditional
    //   succeeded), then getEBTN's return is truthy
    // and the loop continues until there is no 
    //   more i elements.

    // In other words:  ** MAGIC**

    return v &gt; 4 ? v : undef;

}());

<p>The above given is the <a href=""https://gist.github.com/527683#gistcomment-7599"" rel=""nofollow"">documented (and slightly improved) version by Paul Irish</a> on a <a href=""http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/detect-ie-in-js-using-conditional-comments/"" rel=""nofollow"">snippet by James Padolsey</a>. I am posting the commented version to let you know that I might need a simpler explanation if anybody may.</p>

<p>I would really like to know <strong>what happens inside the while loop</strong>. I don't understand that. </p>
","70393","","<p><code>v</code> stores the IE version number. It is initialised to 3 so the loop creates strings like the following upon each iteration:</p>

<pre><code>// v = 3
&lt;!--[if gt IE 4]&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;![endif]--&gt;

// v = 4
&lt;!--[if gt IE 5]&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;![endif]--&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If you are confused by this part:</p>

<pre><code>+(++v)+
</code></pre>

<p>it simply means, in context, concatenate <code>'&lt;!--[if gt IE '</code> with the incremented value of <code>v</code> and then concatenate the newly formed string with <code>']&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;![endif]--&gt;'</code> The increment operator <code>++</code> acts to <em>return</em> the <em>incremented</em> value of <code>v</code>, since it <em>precedes</em> <code>v</code>. If it came after <code>v</code>, the current value of <code>v</code> would be returned before the increment happens. Mozilla does <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Arithmetic_Operators"" rel=""nofollow"">a better job</a> of explaining than I do:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This operator increments (adds one to)
  its operand and returns a value. If
  used postfix, with operator after
  operand (for example, x++), then it
  returns the value before incrementing.
  If used prefix with operator before
  operand (for example, ++x), then it
  returns the value after incrementing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>thus the first conditional comment created is always 4. The loop continues until <code>div.getElementsByTagName('i')[0]</code> does not yield any DOM element, evaluates to <code>false</code> and forces the loop to exit.</p>

","70393","","<p>You create a recursive function which calls itself whenever <code>.load</code> completes, thus guaranteeing order:</p>

"<p>So we have a table with a lot of checkboxes, onchange of a checkbox we want to call some javascript
we use something similar to this snippet</p>

<pre><code>addEventObserver(elementId){
        // ($= means 'ends with') this is required for elementIds which are in a table and get prepended with some id
        $$('[id$=:'+elementId+']').each(function(e) {
            Event.observe(e, 'change', function(event) {
                submitAction(something);
            });
        });
}

&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" language=""javascript""&gt;
                    addEventObserver('someId');
                &lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>this works fine with our test environment settings. In production though we have tables with ~700 checkboxes and this makes the browser/cpu get stuck.</p>

<p>We use jsf</p>
","70393","","<p>I would scrap adding an event listener to every single checkbox in favour of writing a single ""smart"" event handler attached to a container element. Here is a simple example:</p>

<pre><code>var theDiv = document.getElementById(""foo"");
theDiv.onchange = function(e) {
    if (e.target.tagName.toLowerCase() == ""input"" 
          &amp;&amp; e.target.type.toLowerCase() == ""checkbox"") {
        alert(""do something"");
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Demo: <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/xFC3A/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsfiddle.net/xFC3A/</a></p>

<p>The onchange event is thus captured by the container div which is bubbles up to. The event attached to the div can test for the type of element that triggered the event (the <a href=""http://www.quirksmode.org/js/events_properties.html#target"" rel=""nofollow"">source/target element depending on the browser</a>) and react accordingly. Main advantages are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Only one event handler - no time wasted binding handlers to hundreds of elements.</li>
<li>It will continue to work on  dynamically added elements (via AJAX, JS etc.).</li>
</ol>

So when I submit the form I can get this values.</p>

<br/>
thanks alot</p>
","70393","","<p>That is because facebox is not actually redirecting the browser to that page, but fetching via ajax and injecting it into the facebox div on the same page.</p>

<p>You could try grabbing the href attribute of the anchor instead, perhaps something like:</p>

<pre><code>var lastVisited = null;
var lastVisitedQS = null;
$(""a[rel='facebox']"").facebox()
          .click(function() {
              lastVisited = this.href;

              // you can extract the query string like this
              var a = document.createElement('a');
              a.href = lastVisited;
              lastVisitedQS = a.search; // should give path=blabla
          });
</code></pre>

<p>and then in your <code>destination.htm</code> do:</p>

<pre><code>alert(lastVisited);
alert(lastVisitedQS);

"<p>Here is my code. This centers images vertically with the class productImage. I have a bunch of images within the class. This works fine in chrome. but itermittently in ie and firefox. I can't figure out what's going on. I think it has something to do with when the image is getting loaded. I though by binding the load event to each image, it would always wait until each image is loaded until it fires, but it is not ... sometimes. Can anyone shed some light on this?</p>

<p>Thanks,

","70393","","<p>It could be that the images are getting cached by the browser, thereby preventing the <code>.load</code> event from firing. You can circumvent this problem by testing for the <code>.complete</code> property on each image, and where it is set, manually triggering the <code>.load</code> event:</p>

<pre><code>$('img.productImage').one(""load"",function() {
    $(this).css({
        'margin-left': $(this).width() / 2 + 'px',
        'margin-top': $(this).height() / 2 + 'px'
    });
}).each(function() {
    if(this.complete) $(this).trigger(""load"");

"<p>I have a function that does some stuff and one thing it does is calculates height/width and applies css top/left for centering. Instead of rewriting the formula more than once, I want to be able to reuse it and pass arguments through it.</p>

    left: (wrapper.width() - loading.outerWidth()) / 2 + 'px'

    var context = $(this);
    context.css({
        top: (wrapper.height() - context.outerHeight()) / 2 + 'px',

","70393","","<p>Based on your DOM structure, you can do:</p>

selects.each(function(index, el) {

"<p>I'm trying to replace a site written procedurally with a nice set of classes as a learning exercise.</p>

<p>So far, I've created a record class that basically holds one line in the database's main table.</p>

<p>I also created a <code>loader</code> class which can:</p>

<pre><code>loadAllFromUser($username)
loadAllFromDate($date)
loadAllFromGame($game)
</code></pre>

<p>These methods grab all the valid rows from the database, pack each row into a record, and stick all the records into an array.</p>

<p>But what if I want to just work with <em>one</em> record? I took a stab at that and ended up with code that was nearly identical to my procedural original.</p>

<p>I also wasn't sure where that one record would go. Does my loader class have a protected record property?</p>

<p>I'm somewhat confused.</p>

<p>EDIT - also, where would I put something like the HTML template for outputting a record to the site? does that go in the record class, in the loader, or in a 3rd class?</p>
","70393","","<p>You can encapsulate the unique parts of <code>loadAllFrom...</code> and <code>loadOneFrom...</code> within utility methods:</p>

<pre><code>private function loadAll($tableName) {
    // fetch all records from tableName
}

private function loadOne($tableName) {
    // fetch one record from tableName
}
</code></pre>

<p>and then you won't see so much duplication:</p>

<pre><code>public function loadAllFromUser() {
    return $this-&gt;loadAll(""user"");
}

public function loadOneFromUser() {
    return $this-&gt;loadOne(""user"");
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you like, you can break it down further like so:</p>

<pre><code>private function load($tableName, $all = true) {
    // return all or one record from tableName
    // default is all
}
</code></pre>

<p>you can then replace all of those methods with calls such as:</p>

<pre><code>$allUsers = $loader-&gt;load(""users"");
$date = $loader-&gt;load(""date"", false);

","70393","","<p>Elements injected via ajax need to have event handlers rebinded to them, or alternatively event handlers <em>delegated</em> to a suitable parent/container:</p>

<p>Is it the first solution? Because jQuery creates an object in the $.cache for every div.</p>

<p>PS: is an object with more than 1000 entries a problem for JavaScript?</p>
","70393","","<p>You can use event delegation to attach a single ""smart"" event handler to a suitable parent container:</p>

<pre><code>$(""#parent"").delegate(""div[id^='sId']"", ""click"", function() {

</code></pre>

<p>Advantages of the above approach:</p>

<ul>
<li>Only one event handler.</li>
<li>Can be attached to a jQuery object as opposed to a selector, which
makes <code>.delegate</code> calls chainable.</li>
<li>Works for future elements, such as those added via JS/Ajax.</li>

<pre><code>document.getElementById(""container"").onclick = function(e) {

    // e.target is the target of the event or ""source element""
    alert(e.target.innerHTML);
};

// dynamically adds new paragraph on button click
document.getElementById(""add"").onclick = function() {

    var event = e || window.event

    var oElement = e ? e.target : window.event.srcElement;
    if (!event.shiftKey &amp;&amp; !event.ctrlKey &amp;&amp; !event.altKey) {
        if ((key_code &gt; 47 &amp;&amp; key_code &lt; 58) ||
            (key_code &gt; 95 &amp;&amp; key_code &lt; 106)) {

<p>The one that's actually not trivial for me to explain is ""what the heck is a class?""</p>

Best I have so far:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A <strong>variable</strong> holds some kind of data; one variable might be a first name, another variable might be your weight in pounds.  </p></li>
<li><p>A <strong>method</strong> is a function, it does stuff, and can do stuff with those variables.   A method might display your name on screen, or tell you how much weight you should lose to have a good BMI ratio.</p></li>
<li><p>An <strong>object</strong> holds both variables and methods; one object might represent you, a second object might represent me.</p></li>
<li><p>A <strong>class</strong> is kind of the blueprint or template that describes the methods and variables that will be in each object.  An object is an instantiated (instance of a) class; an object is something, while the class is simply the plans to make that something.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Continuing the example, we have a Person object, which is instantiated to hold Alice's data, and another Person object instantiated to hold Bob's data, and another for Carol, and so on.</p>

<p><br/></p>

<p>How do I tune this example to make more sense, and/or what's a better approach?  The word ""instantiated"" feels too heavy at this point.</p>

","70393","","<blockquote>
  <p>I'm not looking for JavaScript objects.</p>

<p>There are no ""associative arrays"" in JavaScript, just objects comprised of property names and values which can be treated as such. So, what you are looking for is in fact objects. In fact, this example from your question is working with an object:</p>

<pre><code>var myArray = [];
myArray['a'] = 'b';
alert(typof myArray); // 'object'
</code></pre>

<p>You initially construct the object using the array literal syntax:</p>

<pre><code>var myArray = [];
</code></pre>

<p>which means you have created an object which inherits from <code>Array.prototype</code>. So essentially, you are dealing with an object which has been augmented with the methods stored in <code>Array.prototype</code>.</p>

<p>To check that <code>myArray</code> is actually an array (well, I would say JavaScript arrays are pseudo-arrays), you can check its constructor:</p>

<pre><code>alert(typeof myArray === 'object' &amp;&amp; myArray.constructor === Array);
</code></pre>

<p>There's a better way which will also identify arrays constructed in different windows and frames:</p>

<pre><code>alert(Object.prototype.toString.apply(myArray) === '[object Array]');
</code></pre>

<p>You can also use <code>instanceOf</code>:</p>

<pre><code>alert(myArray instanceof Array);
</code></pre>

<p>or <code>Array.isArray</code>:</p>

<p>which one of the 3 is the Correct way to check if the div exists?</p>

<p>EDIT:
Its a pitty to see that people do not want to learn what is the better approach from the three diffrent methods, this question is not actually on ""How to check if a div exists"",
But, its about which method is better, and if someone could explain, then also why.</p>
","70393","","<p>The first is the most concise, I would go with that. The first two are the same, but the first is just that little bit shorter, so you'll save on bytes. The third is plain wrong, because that condition will always evaluate true because the object will <em>never</em> be null or falsy for that matter.</p>

"<p>I'm trying to create a growth map similar to <a href=""http://projects.flowingdata.com/walmart/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://projects.flowingdata.com/walmart/</a>.</p>

<p>I am using <a href=""https://github.com/marioestrada/jQuery-gMap"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/marioestrada/jQuery-gMap</a> to do the maping</p>

"<p>Would some enlighten on the difference of Inner(Private) functions and Closures, as they appear very similar.</p>

<p><strong>Inner Function:</strong></p>

<pre><code>function a(param) {
    function b(theinput) {
        return theinput * 2;
    };
    return 'The result is ' + b(param);
};

<p><strong>Closure</strong></p>

<pre><code>function f() {
    var b = ""b"";
    return function () {
        return b;
    }
}
</code></pre>
","70393","","<p>Your second example explicitly returns a function object which maintains a link to the variables within the function which returned it, while your first example simply returns the result of invoking a private function. So the second example is of <em>closure</em>.</p>

<p>Here's a slightly modified version of your second example which better demonstrates a closure:</p>

<pre><code>function f(){
    var a = ""foo"";

    // return an object containing two methods
    // which can access and modify the private ""a""
    // variable even after the function has returned
    return {
        showA: function() {
          alert(a);  
        },
        changeA: function(str) {
            a = str;
        }

fun.showA(); // ""foo""
fun.changeA(""blahblah""); 
fun.showA(); // ""blahblah""

<p>Fiddle: <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/MKD6p/1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsfiddle.net/MKD6p/1</a></p>

<p>So as you can see, the <em>stack frame</em> has not been deallocated after the function has returned; the variables inside are kept alive and can be played with by means of a suitable interface.</p>

<p>Your first example's inner function <em>does</em> have access to its outer scope, and <em>does</em> return a value based on a variable declared in its outer function/scope/<em>closure</em>. But since a function or module has not been returned the variables local to the function are deallocated once the (outer) function has returned - so, while the the inner function does form a closure with its outer scope, it does not really serve as a productive example of what a closure is.</p>

<p>Could someone please help? Thank you very much.</p>
","70393","","<p>I <em>think</em> you need to change this:</p>

<pre><code>$(""#divSchedules"").load('@Url.Content(""~/Export/ScheduleDelete/"" + id)');
</code></pre>

<p>to this:</p>

<pre><code>$(""#divSchedules"").load('@Url.Content(""~/Export/ScheduleDelete/"")' + id);
</code></pre>

<p>And  you can't have multiple elements with <code>id=""delete""</code>. You should use a className instead to ""group"" elements together. The IDs should be the unique identifiers from your server. So my thinking is to give all your delete button the 'delete' class, and attach a click handler to all elements of that class. The ID of the clicked element can be easily extracted using DOM object property access.</p>

<p>In code:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;img alt="""" src=""@Url.Content(""~/Content/images/icons/delete.gif"")"" style=""border:none;"" class=""delete"" id=""@item.Id"" /&gt;

$(document).ready(function () {
    $("".delete"").click(function() {

        // get ID of clicked image
        var id = this.id
        if (confirm) {

            // concatenate ID to URL
            $(""#divSchedules"").load('@Url.Content(""~/Export/ScheduleDelete/"")' + id);
        }
        else {
            return false;
        }

","70393","","<p>Without seeing your markup, you can definitely reduce those to a single, short <code>.toggle</code>. For example, using the <code>toggleClass</code> and <code>slideToggle</code> methods:</p>

    var num = show.index(this);
    $(this).slideToggle(500);
    $(this).toggleClass('active');

    var cookieValue = ($(this).hasClass(""active"") ? 'show' : 'closed') + num;
    $.cookie(cookieName, cookieValue, { path: '/', expires: 10 }); 
}

<p>Do you really need both <code>.active</code> and <code>.inactive</code> classes? I would suggest the elements simply toggle between the <code>.active</code> class (and nothing, which implies 'inactive').</p>

"<p>In my continued effort to understand hash tags and page navigation I'm hitting a road block with resubmitting form data if a user uses the browsers navigation buttons (e.g. back and forward).</p>

<p>Any thoughts?</p>
","70393","","<p>Your best bet (I think) would be to store the serialized data in a cookie. When the user returns to the page which he/she has already filled out, retrieve the data from the cookie, unserialize it, and place it back where it belongs.</p>

","70393","","<p>JavaScript has no ""block scope"", it only has function scope - so variables declared inside an if statement (or any conditional block) are ""hoisted"" to the outer scope.</p>

<pre><code>if(true) {
    var foo = ""bar"";
}
alert(foo); // ""bar""
</code></pre>

<p>This actually paints a clearer picture (and comes up in interviews, from experience :)</p>

<pre><code>var foo = ""test"";
if(true) {
    alert(foo); // Interviewer: ""What does this alert?"" Answer: ""test""
    var foo = ""bar"";
}
alert(foo); // ""bar"" Interviewer: Why is that? Answer: Because JavaScript does not have block scope
</code></pre>

<p>Function scope, in JavaScript, typically refers to closures.</p>

<pre><code>var bar = ""heheheh"";
var blah = (function() {
    var foo = ""hello"";
    alert(bar); // ""heheheh""
    alert(foo); // ""hello"" (obviously)
});

blah(); // ""heheheh"", ""hello""
alert(foo); // undefined, no alert
</code></pre>

<p>The inner scope of the function has access to the environment in which it is contained, but not the other way around.</p>

<p>To answer your second question, optimisation can be achieved by initially constructing a 'minimal' object which satisfies all conditions and then augmenting or modifying it based on particular condition(s) which has/have been satisfied.</p>

"<p>How would I got about animating appended text to a div tag. For eample the div starts out with no text in it. When a user clicks a button it apends text to the div which the div expands to the height of the text. Instead of just expanding instantly. I would like to animate the expand.</p>

The text will populate about 4 lines in the div when added. Take 3 divs, a top div, center div which is my empty div waiting to be filled. Then a bottom div. With no text in my middle div it looks like the top and bottom div are close to each other.

"<p>This is going to be a nice little brainbender I think. It is a real life problem, and I am stuck trying to figure out how to implement it. I don't expect it to be a problem for years, and at that point it will be one of those ""nice problems to have"". </p>

<p>So, I have documents in my search engine index. The documents can have a number of fields, however, each field size must be limited to only 100kb. </p>

<p>I would like to store the IDs, of particular sites which have access to this document. The site id count is low, so it is never going to get up into the extremely high numbers. </p>

<p>So example, this document here can be accessed by sites which have an ID of 7 and 10.</p>

<pre><code>Document: {
 docId: ""1239""
 text: ""Some Cool Document"",
 access: ""7 10""
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, because the ""access"" field is limited to 100kb, that means that if you were to take consecutive IDs, only <code>18917</code> unique IDs could be stored.</p>

<p>Reference:
<a href=""http://codepad.viper-7.com/Qn4N0K"" rel=""nofollow"">http://codepad.viper-7.com/Qn4N0K</a></p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
    $ids = range(1,18917);
    $ids = implode("" "", $ids);
    echo mb_strlen($ids, '8bit') / 1024 . ""kb"";
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>// Output</p>

<pre><code>99.9951171875kb
</code></pre>

<p>In my application, a particular site, of site ID <code>7</code>, tries to search, and he will have access to that ""Some Cool Document""</p>

<p>So now, my question would be, is there any way, that I could some how fit more IDs into that field? 
I've thought about proper encoding, and applying something like a Huffman Tree, but seeing as each document has different IDs, it would be impossible to apply a single encoding set to every document. </p>

<p>Prehaps, I could use something like tokenized roman numerals?</p>

<p>Anyway, I'm open to ideas. </p>

<p><strong>I should add</strong>, that I want to keep all IDs in the same field, for as long as possible. Searching over a second field, will have a considerable performance hit. So I will only switch to using a second access2 field, when I have milked the access field for as long as possible. </p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<h2>Convert to Hex</h2>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
        function hexify(&amp;$item){
             $item = dechex($item);
        }
    $ids = range(1,21353);
    array_walk( $ids, ""hexify"");
    $ids = implode("" "", $ids);
    echo mb_strlen($ids, '8bit') / 1024 . ""kb"";

?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This yields a performance boost of 21353 consecutive IDs. 
So that is up like <strong>12.8%</strong></p>

<h1>Important Caveat</h1>

<p>I think the fact that my fields can only store UTF encoded characters makes it next to impossible to get anything more out of it. </p>

<p>Edit....
I gave up on this... I just used a filter and regex to validate the email. (the easy way)</p>

<p>Thank you all</p>
","70393","","<p>I think you're going wrong where the <code>validateExt_email()</code> function does not return a boolean (but rather, <code>undefined</code>) because <code>$.ajax</code> fires off a request asynchronously and JavaScript doesn't wait for the <code>success</code> callback to fire. That means in this condition:</p>

<pre><code>if(validateExt_email() &amp; validateExt_pass()) { // always false
</code></pre>

<p>because <code>validateExt_email()</code> always evaluates to <code>false</code> (<code>undefined</code> is <em>falsy</em>).</p>

<p>You can refactor your solution such that the entire form submit only happens once the ajax validation functions have returned, i.e. <code>success</code> is the key, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>ext_form.submit(function(){

    // your email ajax checker
    var emailXHR = $.ajax({
                       type: ""post"",
                       url: ""check_email_ext.php"",
                       ...
                   }).success = function() {
                       // do next validation step
                   });

"<p>For some reason, I just can't grasp how to tell jQuery to look at each div in a bunch and then make a decision based on just that div's content. </p>

 &lt;div class=""elbox""&gt;
  content
  &lt;div class=""options""&gt;A,B,C&lt;/div&gt;

 &lt;div class=""optionB""&gt;B&lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;div class=""optionC""&gt;C&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I want to make a hover function that does this:</p>

<ol>
<li>On hover over #menutable .optionA </li>
<li>Script scans all #maintable .options divs for the text string ""A""</li>
<li>If ""A"" is found in a div.options, nothing happens</li>
<li>If no ""A"" is found in a div.options, script adds some CSS to the parent div (.elbox)</li>
<li>Remove new class on mouseout</li>
<li>Do similar on hover of .optionB (look for ""B"") and .optionC (look for ""C"")</li>
</ol>

<p>So far, I have this:</p>

<pre><code>$('.menutable').hover(function() {
    $('.options').each(function(i) {
        if (!$("".options:contains('A')"")) {
            $('.elbox').addClass('bgtransp');                  
        }
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>But it doesn't work. </p>

<p>However, if I flip the logic so that addClass happens if ""A"" <em>is</em> found, the class is applied onhover to every .elbox. So, I think my script might actually be saying, ""if any .options div has an ""A,"" then hide every .elbox.</p>

<p>What am I doing wrong? Is it my ""each?"" Am I missing a parent selector? ...Or just the wrong approach entirely?</p>

<p>With apologies for my noobness (I'm working on it),
THANK YOU!</p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/500606/javascript-array-delete-elements"">JavaScript Array Delete Elements</a></p>

<p>[""test1"", ""test2"", ""test3""]</p>

<p>and I want to remove test2. The process I am using right now, which I'm hoping isn't the correct way to do it, is using $.each checking the value of each element in the array, maintaining a counter through the process (used as the index reference) and if the value is equal to ""test2"", then I have my index (in form of the counter) and then use splice to remove it.</p>

","70393","","<p>The server should do the heavily lifting because that's what it is there for. The involvement of the client should me minimal.

"<p>When uploading a file from a php form using</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input name=""xxx"" type=""file""&gt;

<p>is it necessary to use the php function <strong>is_uploaded_file</strong> to check if it was uploaded via PHP's HTTP POST upload mechanism?</p>

<p>I've read all there is to read about that function and i don't see the use? Am i wrong?</p>

<p>in the php documentation it says</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Returns TRUE if the file named by filename was uploaded via HTTP POST. This is useful to help ensure that a malicious user hasn't tried to trick the script into working on files upon which it should not be working</p>
</blockquote>

<p>but, the main function to upload the file <strong>move_uploaded_file</strong> also checks if it's a valid file</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This function checks to ensure that the file designated by filename is a valid upload file (meaning that it was uploaded via PHP's HTTP POST upload mechanism). If the file is valid, it will be moved to the filename given by destination.</p>

    // check if the artwork file was uploaded via HTTP POST to prevent a malicious attack

","70393","","<p>This is not difficult. You will need to modify your PHP script to send JSON to the client. You will then need to insert the values from the received JSON into the form elements one by one. Example to get you started:</p>

<pre><code>$(""#button1"").click(function(){
    $.post('script_1.php', { id: $('input[name=""id""]', '#myForm').val() },
        function(json) {
            $(""input[name='name']"").val(json.name);
            $(""input[name='age']"").val(json.age);
        }, ""json"");
});

<pre><code>$data = array('name' =&gt; 'Jeff', 'age' =&gt; '28');
echo json_encode($data);

","70393","","<p>When your IDs exceed 5 digits, your code will break (as has been stated in comments). You can also use the <code>.split</code> approach mentioned by @bordoz, the disadvantage being that spaces in any of the other words would break this solution. Or you could use:</p>

<pre><code>var url = 'ITEM.PRO?id='+ value.replace(/[^\d\.]/g,'');

<p>Which would fail only if any of the other word contain numbers. Which one best fits your situation?</p>

","70393","","<p><code>$(this)</code> does not refer to the object you think it refers to.</p>

<p>With <code>.attr</code> you can use a function as a second argument to compute new attribute values for each matched element, like this:</p>

$('#menu li a').attr('href', function(i, val) {

"<p>I have a piece of code which will invert all the checkboxes on my form. I have multiple elements (not just checkboxes but also  <code>&lt;input type='text'&gt;</code>'s) in it.

                if (document.FormFacturen[i].checked == true) {
                    Elements[iElement].className = ""invoice-tr-standard row"" + iCheckbox;
                } else {
                    Elements[iElement].className = ""invoice-tr-clicked row"" + iCheckbox;

","70393","","<p>Each call to <code>getElementsByClassName</code> is expensive, and it is being called on each pass of your for loop. </p>

<p>since ""widgets"" is a key mapped to an array of objects.</p>

<p>If you're trying to get the length of a column, you can do:</p>

"<p>Though I have seen other posts similar, I haven't been able to find out the exact cause/solution to my problem, so I hope i'm not just reposting what others have asked:</p>

<p>I recently discovered that in jquery the .live() allows my functions to be attached to items which are dynamically added into the page. So I have a list of items, i click delete which uses the get function, using the href as a get variable, which then deletes that item from my database and refreshes the list. </p>

<p>So with the live function, I managed to then have this same function added to the refreshed list. The problem however is that the get variable specifiying which item to delete seems stuck on the last number. </p>

<p>So if I delete item 13, then the list refreshed, and I try to delete say item 15, it seems (from firebug) that the get variable is again attempting to delete item 13 and not 15</p>

<p>apologies for the messy code to follow:</p>

<pre>

    $(document).ready(function() {

    $('.delav').live('click', function(e) {
        e.preventDefault();
                var pager = $(this).attr(""href"");
        $(""#dialog2"").dialog({
            autoOpen: false,
            width: 600,
            modal:true,
          buttons : {
            ""Confirm"" : function() {
                  $('#ava_list').html(""Loading.."");

            var pai =$('#epa_id').val();
                $.get(""/_includes/functions.php"", { table: ""availability"", pa: pai,delattr: pager} ,function(data) {$('#ava_list').html(data);});
            $(this).dialog(""close"");
            },
            ""Cancel"" : function() {
              $(this).dialog(""close"");
            }

    });

","70393","","<p>It would appear that you have multiple input elements with the ID 'epa_id'. If that is the case, you will need to remove duplicate IDs and employ DOM traversal to grab the correct element relative to the clicked <code>.delav</code> instead. </p>

<p>but all i got is 3,jpg is loaded all the time,
how to solve this? where am i wrong?</p>
","70393","","<p>That's because the <code>.load</code> event fires asynchronously. JavaScript will not wait for all the images to load before proceeding with the script execution, so you need to perform the test each time an image has loaded. I've made your code a bit more readable too.</p>

<pre><code>var len = pics.length;
var loadCounter = 0;
for(var i = 0; i &lt; len; i++) {
    $(document.createElement(img)).attr('src', pics[i]).load(function() {
        alert(pics[i] + 'is loaded');
        loadCounter++;
        if(loadCounter === len) {
            alert(""all are loaded"");   
        }
    });
}
</code></pre>

<p>Side note: traversing an array using <code>for...in</code> will yield nasty results. In particular, it will include all properties of <code>Array</code>, so in short, <strong>don't do it</strong> :) <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/karim79/jC8h4/"" rel=""nofollow"">See for yourself.</a></p>

<p>Another thing, the load event may not fire in some browsers when the image has been cached. To avoid this problem, you can manually fire the <code>.load</code> event on each image which has its <code>complete</code> property set.</p>

<pre><code>var len = pics.length;
var loadCounter = 0;
for(var i = 0; i &lt; len; i++) {
    $(document.createElement(img)).attr('src', pics[i]).one(""load"", function() {
        alert(pics[i] + 'is loaded');
        loadCounter++;
        if(loadCounter === len) {
            alert(""all are loaded"");   
        }
    }).each(function() {
        if(this.complete) $(this).trigger(""load"");
    });

"<p>I have a menu which links to anchors on the page. There are a couple of additional pages that can also link back to the home page with these anchors on.</p>

<p>I have some jQuery which changes the color of a menu item when it clicked. So if I click on About on the homepage, it goes to the about anchor and highlights about in blue. If I click on about from the blog page though, it goes to the home page, and the about anchor but it doesn't   highlight the menu item as that jQuery is only triggered by a click event. I am trying to therefore manually trigger the highlight when page loads if it sees an anchor in the URL.</p>

<p>The php file loads as expected when loaded inside a html form, but with ajax load the toggle function for the table is not working. How do I make this work in ajax?</p>
","70393","","<p>Try replacing your click handler with this <a href=""http://api.jquery.com/delegate/"" rel=""nofollow"">delegated</a> handler attached to the table parent. </p>

<pre><code>$(""#report"").delegate(""tr.odd"", ""click"", function() {
    $(this).next(""tr"").toggle();
    $(this).find("".arrow"").toggleClass(""up"");
});
</code></pre>

<p>Since the click event is captured by the table, clicking on the new (replaced) elements will work as expected since the event bubbles up from the <em>target element</em> to the parent to which the handler is attached. The handler will execute the passed function only if the element grabbed by the selector passed in the first parameter to <code>.delegate</code> matches the <em>target element</em>.</p>

<p>EDIT: jQuery 1.3.2 does not have <code>.delegate</code>, but you can use <a href=""http://api.jquery.com/live/"" rel=""nofollow""><code>.live</code></a> instead:</p>

<pre><code>$(""#report tr.odd"").live(""click"", function() {
    $(this).next(""tr"").toggle();
    $(this).find("".arrow"").toggleClass(""up"");
});
</code></pre>

<p>To re-apply your CSS, you can do this:</p>

<pre><code>if (xmlhttp.readyState == 4 &amp;&amp; xmlhttp.status == 200) {
    document.getElementById(""myDiv"").innerHTML = xmlhttp.responseText;
    $(""#report tr:odd"").addClass(""odd"");
    $(""#report tr:not(.odd)"").hide();
    $(""#report tr:first-child"").show();
}
</code></pre>

<p>or <em>get rid of that long ajax method</em> and use <code>$.load</code> as per @Tieson T's suggestion:</p>

<pre><code>$(""#changeContent"").click""(function() {
    $(""#myDiv"").load(""getData.php"", function() {

<p>Once I click the the SUBMIT button, it looks up if it is 1 or 0 just fine. Then it loops through the hidden elements. It recongizes that the element is either set to 1 or 0. After that, it goes wrong.</p>

"<p>I am trying to modify this <a href=""http://keith-wood.name/countdown.html"" rel=""nofollow"">JQuery Countdown</a> plugin to initialize itself when it has a value in its <em>div</em> or <em>span</em>. I need because I'm building an application that will allow people to have any amount of countdowns on their page and they chose what the target date/time is. </p>

<p>As a reference, I'm doing my web app in ASP.Net, but I don't think it really matters for my problem.</p>

<p>The date will be coming from a Database but I will probably be converting it in seconds in the code-behind. Basically, I want to be able to throw something like</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""93"" class=""countdown""&gt;300&lt;/div&gt; /* Countdown of 300 seconds, 5 minutes */
&lt;div id=""104"" class=""countdown""&gt;19483&lt;/div&gt; /*Countdown of 5 hours, 24 minutes and 43 seconds */

<p>and initialize all this from a single line of JQuery</p>

<pre><code>$("".countdown"").countdown();
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>$("".countdown"").countdown(""initializeFromValue"");
</code></pre>

<p>I'm starting to get familiar with JQuery itself, but I have a hard time changing the javascript in the back. I have started creating a new part in the code. My issue here is to verify if the div has a value in integer and then initialize the value of the Countdown to that value, deleting that value after.</p>

        $(""#countdown4"").countdown({ until: $(""#countdown4"").text() });
    });
</code></pre>

<p>This is working since every countdown has an unique ID and I can also get its own text value. But it is not flexible. Can I proceed from there as well? I know for sure that</p>

"<p>I am using jQuery UI (1.8.16) extensively in my application.</p>

<p>this is the javascript:</p>

<pre><code>BuildAnswersPager: function(selectedPage, totalPages) {
    $(""#answersPager"").empty();
    if (totalPages &gt; 1) {
    var ctl = [];
    var isChecked = """";

        if (i === selectedPage) {

    $(""#answersPager"").append(ctl.join(''));
    $(""#answersPager"").buttonset();

   // Fetches json data (new page)

<p>Everything works fine but I was wondering if I have to destroy the buttonset before I rebuild it (at the moment I just empty it). </p>

<p>Are there any memory issues I must be aware of ? </p>
","70393","","<p>Not really. <code>.empty</code> removes all data and handlers attached to any removed markup via jQuery's internal <code>.cleanData</code> method thereby preventing any memory leaks, so you are quite safe. From the <a href=""http://api.jquery.com/empty/"" rel=""nofollow"">docs</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To avoid memory leaks, jQuery removes other constructs such as data
  and event handlers from the child elements before removing the
  elements themselves.</p>

"<p>I have a question regarding efficiency of jQuery filtering. I've just written quite a lengthy expression and I was wondering if jQuery stops filtering if the current number of matches is 0.</p>

<pre><code>passengers.filter('input.FromDate[value=""01/09/2011""]')
          .closest('tr')
          .filter('input.ToDate[value=""08/09/2011""]')
          .length;
</code></pre>

<p>If after the first <code>filter()</code> call the number of matches is 0 will jQuery continue to search the DOM or will it forego the additional calls and just return 0?</p>
","70393","","<p>The nice thing about chainable calls with jQuery is that when there are no matches, nothing bad will happen. </p>

<p>When you call <code>.filter</code> and zero matches have been yielded, you <em>are</em> executing the subsequently chained method calls by definition because they are invoked directly on the returned object (that's what chaining is). </p>

<p>When there are no matches, JavaScript will still invoke each subsequently chained method on each returned object. How much wasted processing happens depends on how the specific method has been implemented.</p>

<pre><code>$.fn.doesItTryToDoStuff = function() {
    alert('called');

    // here I could have some wasteful process
    // which could foolishly be executed

"<p>I am working on a jQuery plugin, but I am having some trouble with the design pattern, which combines the defaults and options, data and namespacing techniques from jQuery's <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring"" rel=""nofollow"">best practices</a>. Here's the abstracted version of my code:</p>

<pre><code>(function($) {
var defaults = {
    key1: 'value1',
    key2: 'value2'
};
var settings = {};
var methods = {
    init: function() {

            console.log('init called');
            // If the plugin hasn't been initialized yet
            if (!data) {
                //Do more setup stuff here

    },
    methodname: function() {
        return this.each(function() {
            var $this = $(this), data = $this.data('pluginname');
            console.log('methodname called');
            //test for settings and data
            console.log(settings);
            console.log(data);

    settings = $.extend({}, defaults, options);
    if (methods[method]) {
        return methods[method].apply(this, Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 1));
    } else if (typeof method === 'object' || ! method) {
        return methods.init.apply(this, arguments);

<p>If you run that code with the latest version of jQuery you will see that I am calling both the <code>init</code> and <code>methodname</code> functions and logging the <code>settings</code> and <code>data</code> objects in each. In the <code>methodname</code> call, I can access both <code>settings</code> and <code>data</code>, but in the <code>init</code> call itself, the <code>data</code> object returns undefined. If I set a breakpoint in the script at line 21, I can call back the <code>data</code> object with <code>$this.data('pluginname')</code> in the console. Anyone see what I am doing wrong here? I should just be able to write <code>data.key3</code> inside the init, function, right?</p>
","70393","","<p>In your <code>init</code> method, at the very beginning of the <code>.each</code> loop you assign the object stored in the currently iterated element to your <code>data</code> variable. If there is no data available for the specified key, <code>data</code> is undefined. </p>

<p>You then test <code>data</code> for truthiness, and if it is evaluates to <em>false</em> you go ahead and assign a data object to the current element.</p>

<p>Then later on, you call <code>console.log(data);</code> and it gives you <code>undefined</code>. This is expected, as <code>data</code> was initially assigned <code>undefined</code> - and that's what it still refers to. To fix:</p>

<pre><code>// if undefined
if (!data) {
    //Do more setup stuff here


    $this.data('pluginname', {
        key3: 'value3',
        key4: 'value4'
    });
    data = $this.data('pluginname');

<p>And here is the ticket mentioned in the comment. Apparently it was fixed eight months ago:</p>

<p><a href=""http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7054#comment:10"">http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7054#comment:10</a></p>

<p>According to Dave Methvin the solution seems to be to <em>Ensure that the DOM element ref in an event handler is removed by cleanData to avoid an IE6/7/8 memory leak.</em></p>

<p>In other words, set references to DOM elements within event handlers to <code>null</code> otherwise some awesome browsers, without mentioning any names <em>cough</em> IE <em>cough</em> will leak memory.</p>

<p><code>discardElement</code> (from your link) inserts the element into a container, and then empties the container, thereby <em>nullifying</em> any references to that element.</p>

<p>With that in mind, I would suggest upgrading jQuery. The article you point to is from 2009, and two years is roughly equivalent to four-hundred-zillion man hours of jQuery development time.</p>

<p>Finally, here is some interesting (and ridiculously long) reading on leak patterns in Internet Explorer:</p>

"<p>I'm working on a web framework and am trying to build XSS prevention into it. I have set it up so it will escape incoming data for storage in the database, but sometimes you want to save html that the user generates. I am trying to make a custom tag that will prevent any javascript from executing, here is my first hack at it:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;

        &lt;!-- end user content --&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/preventjs&gt;

    &lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
      // &lt;preventjs&gt; tags are supposed to prevent any javascript events
      // but this does not unbined DOM events
      $(""preventjs"").find(""*"").unbind();
    &lt;/script&gt;

  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I tried using jQuery to unbind everything, but it doesn't unbind events in the DOM, which is exactly what I'm trying to do. Is it possible to unbind all events for a DOM element?</p>
","70393","","<p><code>.unbind</code> will only unbind events attached using jQuery. You can get rid of inline event handler code by setting them to null, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>$(""preventjs *"").removeAttr(""onclick"").removeAttr(""onmouseover"");
</code></pre>

<p><a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/bkgx2/"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>Demo.</strong></a></p>

<p>EDIT: Here's an evil solution, you can remove all attributes starting with ""on"":</p>

<pre><code>$(""preventjs *"").each(function() {
    var attribs = this.attributes;
    var that = this;
    $.each(attribs, function(i, attrib) {
        if(attrib.name.indexOf(""on"") === 0) {
            $(that).removeAttr(attrib.name);

"<p>My question is rather basic, but I can't find it out.</p>

<p>I have a quite big library of images to display in my website, so I've written a jQuery script to scan the folder, gather sources of images and put them as a background-image in the right place. That works perfectly.</p>

<p>My second step is to prepend a copy of an image above it and process it with Pixastic library. I tried with the code shown below:</p>

<pre><code>function blurBackground() {
$wrapper2.prepend('&lt;img class=""blur"" src=""'+$sourceImage+'"" /&gt;'); // great, a copy of the image is set!
    $('.blur').load(function() {    // execute on load
        $('.blur').pixastic(""blur"").css('border','10px solid red'); // failed to process with pixastic, succeded to edit css
    });
}
</code></pre>

<p>If I have an existing <code>&lt;img src=""something.jpg"" class=""blur"" /&gt;</code> in my markup everything works perfect, even if I strip the function down and use only that code:</p>

<pre><code>function blurBackground() {
 $('.blur').pixastic(""blur"");
}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is I cannot process any image which is prepended or appended.</p>

<p>I have no idea what I'm doing wrong. $sourceImage is 100% correct, and the image is always cached before the execution of the function.</p>
","70393","","<p>It looks to me like you need to do this specify <code>this</code> image with the class <code>.blur</code> within the <code>.load</code> event handler.</p>

"<p>I'm not sure the title explains it well enough, but was trying to keep it quite short!</p>

<p>So, I've got a number of images scattered around a page and have created a lightbox gallery for them all (.cboxElement is the class that calls it).  What i wanted to add into this was a hover effect on each image affected by the lightbox so the user knows it can be zoomed.</p>

<p>The problem:</p>

<p>I didn't write the original code for the site and this is a new feature.  Due to inconsistencies in classes across images, I had to prepend a  tag before each image with a unique class for the hover method to refer to, as follows:</p>

<pre><code>    $(""a.cboxElement"").each(function(){
        $(this).prepend(""&lt;span class='zoom'&gt;&lt;/span&gt;"");
    });
</code></pre>

<p>Immediately following this, I've used the hover effect:</p>

<pre><code>    $(""a.cboxElement"").hover(function(){
        $(""a.cboxElement span"").fadeIn('fast');
    },
    function(){
        $(""a.cboxElement span"").fadeOut('fast');
    });
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that when I hover over an image on the page, the hover effect appears on every image simultaneously and I can't work out how to get it to affect only the image I'm hovering over.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any ideas as to what I could do?</p>

"<pre><code>var array = [,, ""cat"", ""dog""];

<p>This will create an array with two empty values (so that I can use them later on). I can't think of any other way to do this without doing the slow and tedious <code>array[2] = ""cat""; array[3] = ...</code> Is this a good way to do this. Or is there another recommended practice that emulates this ability.</p>
","70393","","<p>Yeah, it's fine. Essentially what you're doing is declaring an array of four elements but without having to type in <code>undefined</code> for the first two. If, however, you <em>don't</em> want the length to equal four, you will have to do it another way.</p>

<p>It seems that your array is a list of elements where the mapping of the index to the value is important. If that is the case, you might consider using an object instead, which (I <em>think</em>) would be neater:</p>

<pre><code>var obj = { 2: ""foo"", 3: ""bar""};
alert(obj[2]);
// later
obj[4] = ""baz"";
alert(obj[4]);

","70393","","<p><code>.live</code> relies on the event bubbling all the way up to document, and you are stopping the immediate propagation of the your handler, thereby stopping it from working. Try this instead:</p>

"<p>I am developing my first jQuery plugin but want it to work in a slightly different manner to usual. I'll start by explaining it's purpose:</p>

<p>Very simple, &lt;input&gt; fields with a title attribute specified will fill the input box with the value in the attribute, focusing on the input field will remove the value and allow the user to type in the box.</p>

<p>I know this isn't new stuff and probably done 100 times before but it's more the learning curve than the final outcome.</p>

<p>So, I've got it so far working in two ways, first method is the code is called onto a particular element:</p>

<pre><code>$('input').fillForm();
</code></pre>

<p>The other method involves using a selector within the plugin (specified as an option) which will find all elements on the page with a particular class and run the function:</p>

<pre><code>$().fillForm(); // Called from the document load

$('.fillForm').each(function () {... // Within the plugin
</code></pre>

<p>My question is, is there a way to detect whether or not the user as specified a selector: $(<strong>'input'</strong>).fillForm(); The bit highlighted in bold.</p>

<p>That way, if they haven't then I can tell it to use the default css selector.</p>

<p>Here is a fiddle of my code: <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/chricholson/HwkRw/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsfiddle.net/chricholson/HwkRw/</a></p>

<p>There are two versions there, swap the comments around to try out the other method.</p>
","70393","","<p>I'm not sure <em>exactly</em> what it is you're after, but you can access the selector <em>property</em> of the constructed jQuery object like this:</p>

<pre><code>console.log($(""input"").selector); // ""input""
</code></pre>

<p>From within your plugin, you can do:</p>

<pre><code>$.fn.myPlugin = function() {
    console.log(this.selector);
}

$(""p"").myPlugin(); // ""p""
</code></pre>

<p><a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/JkPNA/1/"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>Demo.</strong></a></p>

<p>If you need to <em>do something</em> to the matching element(s), you don't really need to test first, since nothing will happen if there are no matches, so:</p>

<pre><code>$("".second:has(.tg-hey)"").hide();
</code></pre>

<p>is perfectly safe.</p>

<p>Another way is to use <code>.is</code> and <code>:has</code>:</p>

<pre><code>if($("".second"").is("":has(.tg-hey)"")) {
    // do something
}
</code></pre>

<p>but I wouldn't do that since it just seems like too much jQuery for a fairly simple task.</p>

"<p>I've seen a couple similar questions here with no real answers. Hopefully someone notices this...</p>

<p>IE 8 and below are refusing to apply styles from the css stylesheet defined in the header when they are loaded in a document.ready jquery call.</p>

<p>Paranoid client wants NOBODY to see code or the dev site so I'll have to give a short example.
The client wants the site to render only the relevant portion of HTML on a nearly exclusively ""ajaxed"" site. So, the site is like a grid. If you load the homepage you get this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""content""&gt;
    &lt;section id=""home""&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Title&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Hi There!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then onload I use jquery to render the surrounding pages...</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function(){
    $('#content').append('&lt;section id=""about""&gt;&lt;h1&gt;About Us&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/section&gt;');
});
</code></pre>

<p>IE can handle this much, but when it comes to respecting my carefully plotted css, it just ignores the styles and laughs at me.</p>

<p>The site is entirely positioned with absolute positioning, tons of z-indexing and a horrendous amount of jquery animation. The kind of thing you do not want to have recreate in some extra stupid way for some inferior yet dominantly used browser. Dear god please tell me someone has figured out some way to get IE to respect defined styles on elements created after load.</p>

<p>Have ye any ideas?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I know chunks of real code are preferred but this is succinct and tells you enough without having a full blown audit. Even if the only defined style is #about{ display:none; } it is ignored. The about section is written as requested but it is display block by default.</p></li>
<li><p>I also know this is not technically ajaxing, but I'm using technical jargon to attempt to clarify the order of page loading in as much as it is not standard loaded html.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>THE SOLUTION</strong></p>

<pre><code>$('#content').append($('&lt;section&gt;').attr('id', 'about').html('&lt;h1&gt;About Us&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;some text&lt;/p&gt;'));
</code></pre>

<p>Properly applies the element as well as the css for this and all children. Not sure why nested elements are read properly by IE without having to be declared the same way, but I am definitely grateful. Thanks jfriend00 and everyone else who helped.</p>
","70393","","<p>To be safe, use jQuery to apply said classes after the append:</p>

<pre><code>$('#content').append('&lt;section id=""about""&gt;&lt;h1&gt;About Us&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/section&gt;');
$(""#about"").addClass(""foo"");

"<p>How can i load a new image in place of another using jQuery?</p>

<p>I hope to do this possibly by clicking a button for previous or next. See below for an example. <strong>Important: i dont know how many pictures on server (1 or 100). So, i cant load them all on web page load. and cant do array in javascript code on same reason</strong></p>

<pre><code>showing /img/1.jpg (click on button 'next')
showing /img/2.jpg (click on button 'next')

showing /img/2.jpg (click on button 'prev')
showing /img/1.jpg (click on button 'prev')

","70393","","<p>You can just create an image tag each time you need a new image, and append it to the document and it will be loaded in asynchronously. e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>var $img = $(""&lt;img/&gt;"");
$img[0].src = ""foo.jpg"";
$(""#someDiv"").append($img);

","70393","","<p>You're declaring the <code>hide()</code> function after you invoke it using <code>setTimeout</code>. Simply put the declaration before the <code>setTimeout</code> call.</p>

"<p>The question is: how can I make it so that every time openZonePupup() is called, whatever is assigned to the .click function changes on every call because right now it only changes on the first call ofopenZonePupup() </p>

<p>Let me first try and explain what the program does through prose and examples. This is for an online course which is split up into units. once a unit is clicked on a box pops up asking the user if they want to do a lesson or an exercise and then the lesson and exercise button has a function attached, with specific variables related to that lesson or exercise, to it with the <code>.click</code> function. </p>

<p>The problem is that once one unit has been clicked upon and the specific variables in the function applied using the <code>.click</code> function, once this popup has been closed and the user clicks on another unit, it uses the same specific variables from the first time. Maybe looking at my code would help you better:</p>

<p>Popup HTML:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""jqmWindow"" id=""dialog""&gt;
    &lt;a id=""popupHide"" href=""javascript:;"" onclick=""$('#dialog').jqmHide();"" style=""""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

    &lt;div id=""zoneName""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div id=""buttons""&gt;
            &lt;a id=""lessonButton"" class=""lessonButton""&gt;Lesson&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;a id=""exerciseButton"" class=""exerciseButton""&gt;Exercise&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The function called when the link to the unit is clicked on. It applies the name to the popup html and sets the link to the lesson and exercise according to the variables specified, then after it shows the popup:</p>

<pre><code>function openZonePupup(name,juegoID,tipoID,lang,nivel) {
    $(""#zoneName"").html(name);

    $("".lessonButton"").click(function () { 
    $('#dialog').jqmHide();
        abrirLeccion(juegoID,nivel);    
    });

    $("".exerciseButton"").click(function () { 
        obreJoc(juegoID, tipoID, name);
        $('#dialog').jqmHide();
    });

    $('#dialog').jqmShow();
}
</code></pre>

<p>openZonePopup is called by the text for the unit, for example:  </p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href=""javascript:;"" onclick=""abrirZonePopUp('Past Simple - Past Continuous ',8,2,'EN',1);""&gt;02&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=""javascript:;"" onclick=""abrirZonePopUp('Conjunctions',22,8,'EN',1);""&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;

<p>I hope you understand, if not leave a comment and i'll respond asap, thanks for any help that you can give!</p>
","70393","","<p>As a first step I would try unbinding the click handlers before binding them to the specific values passed by the function.</p>

"<p>Here's some code I've got in my sandbox.php file:</p>

    &lt;img class=""active"" id=""also"" alt=""Fifty-Fifty?"" src=""http://placehold.it/350x150""/&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div id=""title""&gt;
    This is the alt element of the 350x150 image, found by class.  It should return 'Fifty-Fifty?':
    &lt;script&gt;
      $(""#title"").text($('.jq .active').attr('alt'));
    &lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So, I'm just trying to figure out why ""This is the alt element..."" gets scrubbed, and I want to know how to keep that from happening.  I actually don't feel that I need a 'title' div.  I feel like I could just append the text into the 'jq' section.</p>

<p>Could someone explain why people over structure documents, also?  I'm looking at the code for StackOverflow, and they put all of the links in their <code>hlinks-custom</code>-id'd div in that div.  The anchors make it very clear structural separator, and it doesn't seem anything more is needed.  Go to YouTube.com, though, and you'll see that every single link on the page has its own div.  Does that not seem strange?</p>
","70393","","<p>Because you're replacing, not appending. Try:</p>

"<p>I have successfully implemented a slideToggle effect on a navigation bar item/image.  You can see the effect <a href=""http://salliannputman.com/test.html"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.</p>

&lt;/ul&gt;

<p>And the script:</p>

<pre><code>$('li#home').hover(function () {
    $('img.hover').slideToggle('medium');
    });
</code></pre>

<p>Because I couldn't get this working I also tried implementing jQuery UI, with the slide effect included, and this script, but I got no effect at all with this:</p>

<pre><code>$('li#home').hover(function () {
      $('img.hover').show(""slide"", { direction: ""down"" }, 1000);
});

"<p>I'm trying to create a multi-select list and do some stuff when the selection changes.  I have the following code in an ASP.NET MVC view (Model.AvailableChoices is an IEnumerable):</p>

<pre><code>@Html.ListBoxFor(
m =&gt; m.Value,
Model.AvailableChoices.Select(s =&gt; new SelectListItem() {Text = s, Value = s,})
, new {@class = ""StringChoiceMetadataFieldViewModel""}
)
</code></pre>

<p>It generates the following html:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;SELECT id=""MetadataFields_10__Value"" name=""MetadataFields[10].Value"" multiple=""multiple"" &gt;
  &lt;OPTION value=""Wakka""&gt;Wakka&lt;/OPTION&gt;
  &lt;OPTION value=""Splat""&gt;Splat&lt;/OPTION&gt;
  &lt;OPTION value=""Bang""&gt;Bang&lt;/OPTION&gt;
&lt;/SELECT&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And I'm binding to the change event via jQuery (v1.6.4):</p>

<pre><code>$('#someDivAboveTheSelect select').change(function () {
alert('change event');
}); 
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>The change event handler is not getting hit when I ctrl+click to change the selection, unless I do 
something that causes the <em>first</em> selection in the list to change.  So if I select Wakka then ctrl+click Splat I don't get the event.  However if I select Splat then ctrl+click Wakka I do.</p>

<p>Normal click changes work just fine.  And everything works just fine in Chrome and Firefox.</p>

<p>Does anybody know what's going on here?  I suspect it might be something about needing IDs on the select options...if that's the case, how do I make that happen with MVC?</p>

<p>If, however, you need to construct a huge table (or multiple ones) comprised of many rows, cells, and whatever, I would suggest doing it <em>offline</em>; that is, assembling all the parts into a plain-old string buffer, and inserting it into the DOM once you have finished constructing it. That way you are not slowing down the browser by repeatedly writing to the DOM, which can be terribly expensive.</p>

<p>any idea?</p>
","70393","","<p>That is because your synchronous ajax call locks up the browser, thereby pausing the animation thread created by <code>.animate</code>. When you call <code>.animate</code>, the browser does not wait for it to finish before evaluating the next ($.ajax) statement, so the sajax call effectively pauses it until the server has responded. Try putting the ajax call into <code>.animate</code>'s callback, or removing the <code>async: false</code> option.</p>

","70393","","<p>I am not certain how this would fit in to that plugin, but a general solution which I use in such situations (I have adapted it to fit your situation to the best of my ability) is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>$content.one(""load"", function() {
    var $imgs = $(this).find(""img"");
    $imgs.hide();
    var loadCounter = 0;
    var nImages = $imgs.length;
    $imgs.load(function () {
        loadCounter++;
        if(nImages === loadCounter) {

            // all the images have loaded
            // reveal them, remove the loading indicator
            $body.removeClass(""loading"");
            $imgs.show(); 
        }

    // trigger load event if images have
    // been cached by the browser
    }).each(function () {
        if(this.complete) {
            $(this).trigger(""load"");   
        }

","70393","","<p><code>$.getJSON</code> fires off asynchronously, meaning that in most cases it will not have completed by the time you read out your variables. You will need to restructure your solution such that you do the thing you want to do within it's success callback:</p>

<pre><code>$.getJSON(""http://path.json"", function(data) {
    $.each(data, function(key, val) {
        names.push(key);
        marks.push(parseInt(val.Science));

"<p>I am currently using the RadTreeNode from telerik.  I would like to make use of some nicer scrollbars which appear on the hover event. For the most part it seems to be working as expected.  However, if you expand an item in the tree node (so that scroll bar would be needed) the scroll bars don't appear until you mouse out and back in again.  I presume this is happening because the hover event is not firing as the mouse is already above the element.  The treeview control has a client side event which fires when a node is expanded.  Is it possible to fire the hover event when this function is fired?  </p>

"<p>I have html  elements with class ""ajaxem"" that are ment to be used in my jquery below. I also have the same for any form elements. For the first few ajax requests the jquery is attached and triggered and work properly. However, after a user logs in or registers, the returned links (which also have class=""ajaxem"") are not caught by jquery and not triggered.</p>

<p>the outputted html at which the scripts stop working is below:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""container""&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Welcome to CodeIgniter!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;a href=""auth/logout/""&gt;Logout&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=""""&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;div id=""body""&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The page you are looking at is being generated dynamically by CodeIgniter.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;If you would like to edit this page you'll find it located at:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;application/views/welcome_message.php&lt;/code&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The corresponding controller for this page is found at:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;application/controllers/welcome.php&lt;/code&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;If you are exploring CodeIgniter for the very first time, you should start by reading the &lt;a href=""user_guide/""&gt;User Guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class=""footer""&gt;Page rendered in &lt;strong&gt;1.0343&lt;/strong&gt; seconds&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div id=""logininfo""&gt;You have successfully registered. &lt;a href=""http://localhost/testrun/auth/login"" class=""ajaxem""&gt;Login&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>which makes no sense since it includes the class ""ajaxem"" which should be caught by jquery but is not.</p>
","70393","","<p>Since the returned link's <code>href</code> does not contain the words 'register' or 'password' neither of the following conditions are met:</p>

<pre><code>if (action.indexOf('register') &gt; 0) {
    $(""div#logininfo"").load(""http://localhost/testrun/auth/register/"").fadeIn();
} else if (action.indexOf('password') &gt; 0) {
   $(""div#logininfo"").load(""http://localhost/testrun/auth/forgot_password/"").fadeIn();
}
</code></pre>

<p>so no ajax request happens.</p>

<p>You will probably need to account for the 'login' scenario, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>} else if (action.indexOf('login') &gt; 0) {
   $(""div#logininfo"").load(""http://localhost/testrun/auth/login/"").fadeIn();
}
</code></pre>

<p>...and why hard-code the URLs when they can be extracted from the clicked anchor?</p>

<pre><code>if (action.indexOf('register') &gt; 0) {
    $(""div#logininfo"").load(this.href).fadeIn();
} else if (action.indexOf('password') &gt; 0) {
   $(""div#logininfo"").load(this.href).fadeIn();

"<p>I need some help me with a peice of JavaScript that will convert telephone numbers to tel: links?</p>

<p>Few things I need this code to do: 1) Only find numbers in text, do not find numbers that are located in tag attributes. 2) Once the number is found wrap it in a tel: anchor. 3) Clean up the number for the href attribute (remove anything that is not a number). 4) Hopefully work pretty fast :)</p>

","70393","","<p>Looks like your form gets submitted the ""classic"" way, because you are not preventing the form's default action. Try adding a <code>return false</code> to the end of your save function, or binding a handler to your form's <code>submit</code> event:</p>

","70393","","<p>You attach another click handler to 'ok' every time you invoke a dialog. Quick fix:</p>

})

"<p>Can anyone point me in the right direction. I am appending an HTML element with data from JSON via AJAX call. tis all works fine.

"<p>What does the selector <code>&lt;div/&gt;</code> syntax mean in this code?  I've seen selectors like <code>div</code> or <code>#someId</code> but I'm confused what the <code>&lt;div/&gt;</code> means</p>

  <p>When the parameter has a single tag, such as <code>$('&lt;img /&gt;')</code> or

","70393","","<p><code>#sub</code> is your submit button. You want to submit the form, so:</p>

<pre><code>document.getElementById(""form1"").submit();

"<p>I have a few very simple jQuery functions running after the document is ready. For example:</p>

<p>I use this because Magento's TinyMCE editor constantly throws in annoying <code>&lt;br /&gt;</code>'s if you have any whitespace leftover. This works great but obviously while the page is loading I have to look at the ugly content with all the <code>&lt;br /&gt;</code>s in it, then it flashes and executes the function which is even more distracting.</p>

"<p>Using JQuery, what is the best way to slide in 3 different pieces of html content? There would also need to be a way to go ""back"" or show the other pieces of content that have been hidden if the user so desired.</p>
","70393","","<p>Basically you want a ""carousel"". You can use a <code>UL</code> with the <code>overflow</code> property set to <code>hidden</code>; each slide would go into a <code>LI</code>, and you can ""slide"" them by animating the <code>margin-left</code> property.</p>

<p>If you're too lazy to implement that, you can steal or check out the code of one of the zillions of freely available carousel implementations out there, just ask google.</p>

"<p>im trying to select an <code>&lt;option&gt;</code> by its text label...
I have an array to autofill a form, but for the dropdown to select a region I have the Name of the region, but not the value is there a way to select this option field by just knowing its name ?</p>

<p>Here's my code so far </p>

<pre><code>var string = $(""textarea[name=shortFillString]"").val();
var split  = string.split('~');
$(""select[name=region]"").val(split[1]);

<p>The value of split[1] is the name of the region for ex. ""Berlin"", but the value of the  is the database ID of the region not the name :s</p>

<p>I hope you can help me...</p>

<p>--EDIT--</p>

"<p>I have a table 'grid' with multiple rows, say 50, and multiple columns, say 50 that are both around 20px square. The user can click and change the cell bg color, which is relevant because I think it needs to stay a table. I would like to let the user 'draw' lines along the grid.

"<p>I created a widget framework using inettuts and added some database functionality with ajax in asp.net and sqlserver.

","70393","","<p>Presumably because your ajax behaviour is replacing elements, destroying any event handlers which are directly tied to them. You will need to use <a href=""http://www.sitepoint.com/javascript-event-delegation-is-easier-than-you-think/"" rel=""nofollow"">event delegation</a>, which, in essence, means tying a ""smart"" handler to a suitable parent container. Try:</p>

<pre><code>// as of jQuery 1.7
jQuery(""#widgetbodycontainer"").on(""click"", "".h"", function () {
    jQuery(this).next("".c"").slideToggle(200);
});
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT: Since you are using a prehistoric release of jQuery, you'll have to do event delegation the old-school way:</p>

<pre><code>jQuery(""#widgetbodycontainer"").click(function(e) {
    console.log(""clicked"");
    // if user clicks on a .c element or a descendant of one
    if (jQuery(e.target).hasClass(""h"") || jQuery(e.target).parents("".h"").length) {
        jQuery(e.target).next("".c"").slideToggle(200);

"<p>The function works, but the popup will open only after the button is clicked twice (and then, subsequent clicks get the action on the first click).</p>

<p>What's wrong?</p>
","70393","","<p>I think that is because you are actually initialising the plugin within the <code>click</code> handler. From a quick skim through the <code>popupWindow</code> docs it appears that the plugin takes care of binding a <code>click</code> handler for you, which means that your first click binds the popup functionality (including an onclick handler) so it only works upon click a second time. I would try:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function() {

    $("".printPopup"").popupWindow({
        centerBrowser: 1,
        height: 500,
        width: 720,
        scrollbars: 1,
        resizable: 1

","70393","","<p>I think you're a bit confused. It appears that you want to use the data attribute of the clicked <code>.categorie</code> to slideToggle the corresponding element. So, you can do:</p>

<pre><code>$('.categorie[data-cat]').click(function(){
    $('div[id=box-""' + $(this).attr('data-cat') + '""]').slideToggle('slow');
});

<pre><code>$('.chapter-title').dblclick(function() {
    $('div p').toggleClass('hidden');
});
</code></pre>

<p>but as is probably fairly evident this only has the effect of hiding all p tags under both of the divs. I want it to just hide the p tags under the relevant H3 heading that was double clicked. I've tried using 'this' but evidently incorrectly as it didn't have the desired effect.</p>

<p>I guess I need to somehow select the parent div of the H3 tag clicked on and the unique id associated with it and then apply the hide/display event to any child p tags within....any suggestions?</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>
","70393","","<p>You can use <code>.nextAll</code> or <code>.siblings</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$('.chapter-title').dblclick(function() {
    $(this).nextAll(""p"").toggleClass('hidden');
});
</code></pre>

<p>or:</p>

<pre><code>$('.chapter-title').dblclick(function() {
    $(this).siblings(""p"").toggleClass('hidden');
});

"<p>How do I find out if a user has scrolled to the end of a table using jQuery?  I can find when the user scrolls to the end of a page using this:</p>

"<p>As a result of an Ajax query, I am renaming a html <em>option</em> tag (the label, not the value).
For this, I do the following</p>

<pre><code>$('#my-select-box option:selected').html(answer.label); // answer.label is a string

<p>Works fine everywhere, but strangely not on Chrome. Well, Chrome actually gets the new label (I can output it in the console) but doesn't render it. The select option looks as if it had kept the previous label.</p>

Plus one MCQ type question will appear. If Participant chooses right answer, Blurriness of Image Should decrease and Then next Question appears for which again on choosing right answer blurriness should decrease little more again . </p>

Please Suggest What should i do?
Is there anything else that i can use?
Thanx in advance.</p>
","70393","","<p>It can. Each time <code>Pixastic.process(img, ""blur"");</code> is called, the image is blurred a little more, so it is just a matter of triggering that method multiple times. </p>

<p>Now <em>decreasing</em> the blurriness will be a little trickier, since (I am guessing) that will involve reverting to a ""less-blurred"" cached copy of the image. Good luck with this!</p>

<p>Probably there's an internal jQuery function that does the check (or a RegExp), but my voodoo is too poor to find it.</p>

<p>Probably something like this:</p>

<pre><code>function isSelector(string)
{ 
   try 
   { 
       $(string); 
       return true;
   } 
   catch(e) 
   { 
       return false; 
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>would do the trick, but it seems a little extreme.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>

<hr>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>For basic CSS selectors this solution should be sufficient:</p>

<pre><code>function isSelector(string)
{
    var ns = document.styleSheets[0];

    if (!ns)
    {
        document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(document.createElement('style'));
        ns = document.styleSheets[0];
    }

    try
    {
        ns.insertRule(string+"" {}"", 0);
        ns.deleteRule(0);

        return true;
    }
    catch(e)
    {
        return false;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>additionally <code>isSelector('#\\~\\!\\@\\$\\%\\^\\&amp;\\*\\(\\)\\_\\+-\\=\\,\\.\\/\\\'\\;\\:\\""\\?\\&gt;\\&lt;\\[\\]\\\\\\{\\}\\|\\</code>\#')` = true, yay :D</p>

  <p>for a specific string how to check if it's a proper jQuery selector</p>

<p>You can't. Just about anything can be a selector, for example my page could consist of a bunch of <code>blah</code>s, which would make <code>$(""blah"")</code> perfectly valid. </p>

<p>jQuery does do some checking on the string you pass as argument, this happens within the <code>init</code> method of the core, which I have highlighted in source browser for you:</p>

","70393","","<p>Well, yes. The first parameter will refer to the index of the element in the set of matched elements. Just do:</p>

<pre><code>...

    var str = $(this).val().toLowerCase();

    $(""td"").filter(function() {

        return $(this).text().toLowerCase().indexOf(str) != -1;
    }).css('background', 'red');​

"<p>Using tabs users can click around a tabbed interface. On each tab results are called and display within a visible div the rest are hidden. When a user clicks a tab, I call results fo r that tab. I have multiple sets of results per tab each calling functions that would be required if only one set was used. This is a possibility. When multiple sets are called my script calls the same functions over and over - for each set. How do I stop subsequent functions from reloading once they have already run for the first time on that tab?</p>

"<p>I have a carousel slider, which have three static ""dots"" in the corner, one for each slide.
When the slide is active, the corresponding dot is white. When inactive, the dot is grey.
I have made this possible with this code below, but Im new to Jquery so Im looking if this can be shortened.</p>

<p>Is it possible to rewrite this code to be shorter?</p>

<p>I have this in the HTML:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a id=""th_1"" class=""thumb act""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a id=""th_2"" class=""thumb""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a id=""th_3"" class=""thumb""&gt; &lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then I have this in jquery, at the top of the document:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function(){   

            $('#th_1').click(function(){
                $('#carousel').carousel(0); //go to slide1
                $('#th_1').addClass('act');
                $('#th_2').removeClass('act');
                $('#th_3').removeClass('act');
            ;})     

            $('#th_2').click(function(){
                $('#carousel').carousel(1); //go to slide 2
                $('#th_1').removeClass('act');
                $('#th_2').addClass('act');
                $('#th_3').removeClass('act');
            ;}) 

            $('#th_3').click(function(){
                $('#carousel').carousel(2); //go to slide 3
                $('#th_1').removeClass('act');
                $('#th_2').removeClass('act');
                $('#th_3').addClass('act');
            ;})
</code></pre>

<p>Then, I also have this below code for when the slides are rotating themselves, without clicks (because I need to change the dots when this happens as well).    </p>

<pre><code>$('#carousel_slide_1').hasClass('active')(function(){
                $('#th_1').addClass('act');
                $('#th_2').removeClass('act');
                $('#th_3').removeClass('act');
            });

$('#carousel_slide_2').hasClass('active')(function(){
                $('#th_1').removeClass('act');
                $('#th_2').addClass('act');
                $('#th_3').removeClass('act');
            });

$('#carousel_slide_3').hasClass('active')(function(){
                $('#th_1').removeClass('act');
                $('#th_2').removeClass('act');
                $('#th_3').addClass('act');
            });
</code></pre>

<p>The class ""active"" is on a div, which contains the slide. When the slide is active, this class is added through another carousel script to the div. So above I check if the div has this class, and if so, I change the class of the ""dot"".</p>

<p>The class ""act"" is simply a background change of the ""dot"" which makes it white in color, if the class is set. If removed, color of dot is grey.</p>

<p>Hope I haven't forgotten anything. If so, I will update this question.
Thanks</p>

<ul>
<li>you just need to bind to the <code>.thumb</code> class, and that will attach a click handler to all matches.</li>
<li>you can get the <code>.index</code> of the clicked one, and use that to invoke your carousel.</li>
<li>the clicked one gets the class, the other ones (<em>siblings</em>) get the class removed.</li>

"<p>I'm using ASP.NET MVC 3 to create a webapp that hosts business games.
On the setup part I have to create multiple teams to play the games.
To dynamically add teams I use this script.</p>

<p>In the background this calls a method in my Controller. In that method, I generate a new instance of my viewmodel which (in his turn) creates a new (random) color for each team.
If I test this in Firefox, I get different colors for each team.
But when I test it in Internet Explorer, I only get one color for all the teams.
My controller action is also only called once.</p>

<p>I clicked in a butten and I insert some data throught ajax in the database, after that I want to open a fancybox. Like I said, it works on Chrome but not in IE8</p>

<p>any help or clue?
thanks in advance</p>
","70393","","<p>Off the top of my head, two possibilites:</p>

<p>1)    <code>'titleShow' : true,</code> &lt;-- extra comma at the end of object IE interprets as Satan</p>

<p>2) Enclose your event handler in a document ready block:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function () {
    $('#btnd16').click(function (e) {
    ...
});

<p>The intended outcome is that when a <code>.poll_option td</code> is clicked, the background colour changes to pink &amp; the checkbox is checked. Each option has different bugs, these are:</p>

<p><strong>Option 1:</strong>
The problem I have is that on Option 1, when I click the checkbox itself, it does not check but everything else works fine. By that I mean that when I click the label &amp; the <code>&lt;td&gt;</code> the outcome is correct. It seems that the event is not bubbling correctly..</p>

<p><strong>Option 2:</strong>
For this one, I tried another solution (removed the .toggle() method) and tried to figure out what element is actually being clicked (<code>console.log(e.target.nodeName);</code>) and now I can click the checkbox but not the label, rather the label does not make the event work.</p>

<p>Could you please have a look at my code &amp; see where I'm going wrong because I'm sure it can't be this hard...</p>

<p>Cheers</p>
","70393","","<p>Proposed simpler solution:</p>

<pre><code>$('.poll_option.one td').click(function (e) {
    $(this).toggleClass('highlight');
    $(this).find('input').prop(""checked"", $(this).hasClass(""highlight""));
    console.log(e.target.nodeName);

// weird that clicking the label does not naturally propagate
// the click event to the parent
}).find(""label"").click(function () {
    $(this).closest(""td"").click();

"<p>I know this is a simple question, but can you all help me with the following code?  I made this function to check that the required fields are filled out in a form.  If it finds one of the inputs is blank, then it should stop and return false.  If all the elements have content, it should return true.  The following function does not work because my <code>return false;</code> line is inside the jQuery <code>.each</code> function.  It is not returning the new function I defined.  How can I handle this?</p>

<pre><code>function check_form(){
    $('form .required').each(function(){
        if ($(this).val() == """"){
            show_dialog('Please enter a value for ' + $(this).attr('name'));

","70393","","<p>Assuming:</p>

"<p>We need to retrieve all the required fields in this codeIgniter/PHP app, since the hide/display js code is used, how can I, using jquery, get all the required fields that are visible? see attached sample html.</p>

<p>In the prod app, all the required fields have this css on the label [ * ]. is there a way to pull all these fields using jquery? Here is the catch, issue, this [ * ] is on the label, I actually need get/check that the associate field is empty and the field could be a text, dropdown, checbox, radio, etc. if empty, I need prevent submission of the form and display error message.</p>

<p>In short, <strong>OnClick</strong> of the submit button, grab <strong>all fields that are required</strong> that are <strong>in fieldsets that are currently visible</strong> [has to do with detecting height and width] if any of these fields are empty, stop form submission and display error message, ie:
""this field is required"" 
""this field is required"" 
""this field is required"" [This will go into a div at the top of the page]</p>

  <p><strong>error(jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown)</strong></p>
  
  <p>A function to be called if the request fails. The function receives
  three arguments: The jqXHR (in jQuery 1.4.x, XMLHttpRequest) object, a
  string describing the type of error that occurred and an optional
  exception object, if one occurred. Possible values for the second
  argument (besides null) are ""timeout"", ""error"", ""abort"", and
  ""parsererror"". When an HTTP error occurs, errorThrown receives the
  textual portion of the HTTP status, such as ""Not Found"" or ""Internal
  Server Error."" As of jQuery 1.5, the error setting can accept an array
  of functions. Each function will be called in turn. Note: This handler
  is not called for cross-domain script and JSONP requests. This is an
  Ajax Event.</p>

","70393","","<p>That is the expected behaviour, considering that the link is anchored to a div on the same page:</p>

<p>You can kill that behaviour like this (you have jQuery included on your page):</p>

"<p>I have a JavaScript function which redirect to Asp.net MVC action method.</p>

<p>I'm refactoring scriptlets to JSTL and EL and I would like to know how to write the following in JSTL / EL:</p>

<pre><code>if(sokandeList != null &amp;&amp; sokandeList.size() &gt; 0) { %&gt;
...

<p>I don't know how to test for null and AFAIK EL can only access getters in this context so I must add a method getSize() to the sokandeList class. Correct? What should the JSTL / EL expression look like? Thanks for any help</p>
","70393","","<p>Here's one way:</p>

"<p>So I have an interval I create for each of my posts, the issue is that I load new posts and remove the old ones, so obviously I'd like to stop the interval for the previous posts.

    myInterval = setInterval(""postStats('""+$(this).attr('id')+""')"", 500);
});

function postStats(pid) {
    //do some stuff
}

$("".button"").click(function(){
    clearInterval(myInterval);
});
</code></pre>
","70393","","<p>You can store the interval ID in a data attribute:</p>

<pre><code>$("".post"").each(function () {
    var that = this;
    var myInterval = setInterval(function () {
        postStats(that.id);
    }, 500);
    $(this).data(""i"", myInterval);
});

<p>and clear the interval specific to each <code>.post</code> like so:</p>

<pre><code>$("".button"").click(function () {

    // assuming the button is inside a post
    clearInterval($(this).closest("".post"").data(""i""));
});

<p>and like SiGanteng said, you should pass a function object to <code>setInterval</code> rather than a string, which only gets <code>eval</code>'d.</p>

"<p>HI I have the jquery script which calls the server every 5 seconds and reload the content (via synchronous ajax call) into div which has a scroll bar enables if the content of the div overflows. now on other browsers when the content of the div is reloaded. the scroll bar maintains its position. but on firefox the scroll bar moves back to the start of div.

<li><p>How to get the attachment number in ID attribute for every LI inside the gallery UL only when an ID attr is there and pass them via ajax data in this way: <code>{ attached : '32,34,38,64,75' }</code> if there is a better way of doing this let me know I want to pass the list items which contain attachments to process. <strong>I want to avoid LI items which are empty, do not include id attr.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>How to get the list item LI which has class of featured e.g. { featured_img : .. } and pass the attachment ID number if featured LI exists, and if none of list items is featured pass featured_img with 0. So i know how to process it via php in the request.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Any help is appreciated.</p>

"<p>Hi I have two dropdown menus: priceMaximum and mortgageMaximum</p>

"<p>I have an oninput event on a textarea to check the height and resize it. Now I need to edit the value sometimes. I do this just by editting the val() in jQuery, but that does not trigger the oninput event. Is there any way to trigger the oninput event programatically with jQuery?</p>
","70393","","<p>You can simply invoke it, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>$(""input"")[0].oninput = function () {
   alert(""hello"");

"<p>Normally, when a page is loaded, and the browser has Javascript disabled, we use the <code>&lt;noscript&gt;</code> tag to write something like a warning and tell the client to enable Javascript. However, Facebook, even <strong>after</strong> you load the page with JS enabled, the moment it's disabled you get a notification. How can I do something like this?</p>

<p>UPDATE : This mechanism is no longer available in Facebook, but it was before, I was too late in asking this question, but if any answer is found, I would really appreciate it.</p>

<h2><strong>What I have tried</strong></h2>

<p>I thought about having a segment inside my page which keeps checking if Javascript is disabled, if yes, show the contents of <code>&lt;noscript&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>To Achieve this, I created a page <strong>CheckJS.html</strong>.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;

&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta http-equiv=""refresh"" content=""0""&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;noscript&gt;
       JS is disabled!
    &lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This page will keep on <strong>refreshing</strong>, when JS is disabled, <strong>JS is disabled!</strong> will appear.</p>

<p>To add this page inside my original page. I tried the following:</p>

<p><strong>1- .load()</strong></p>

<p>I used <strong>JQuery</strong> to <code>.load('CheckJS.html')</code> inside a <code>div</code>. However, it seems that <code>.load()</code> only loads the contents of the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> of <strong>CheckJS.html</strong>. Means the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element and what's inside it will not be loaded inside the <code>div</code>.</p>

<p><strong>2- iframe</strong></p>

<p>After some searching, I found that the only possible way to load a <strong>FULL</strong> html page <strong>including <code>&lt;head&gt;</code></strong> is to use an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;iframe src=""CheckJS.html""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>However, the <code>&lt;meta http-equiv=""refresh"" content=""0""&gt;</code> of <strong>CheckJS.html</strong> affects the parent page, the original page itself started refreshing.</p>

<p>If we are able to use this <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> without forcing the original page to refresh, then this could be a solution, but even if this solution is found, I feel its more of a <strong>trick</strong> rather than a <strong>real</strong> solution.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11633920/how-can-a-site-instantly-detect-that-javascript-has-been-disabled/14764039#14764039""><strong>Antony</strong> 's answer</a> proved that I was wrong about that the <code>iframe</code> refreshes the original page, the browser shows that its refreshing but actually its not, if this is it, then Javascript can be avoided, the <code>CheckJS.html</code> that I provided does the job, and even better, the <code>&lt;noscript&gt;</code> will be hidden when JS is re-enabled. Still this whole iframe approach isn't so user friendly (could freeze the browser), unless refresh occurs every 10 seconds or so, which isn't an <strong>instant detection</strong>.</p>
","70393","","<p>Hrm, I think it depends on the browser. HTML5 supports <code>&lt;noscript&gt;</code> in the HEAD element, so you might try something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;style&gt;
    .noscriptMessage {
         display: none;
     }
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;noscript&gt;

        .noscriptMessage {
             display: block
        }
    &lt;/style&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;

&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div class="".noscriptMessage""&gt;Foo bar baz&lt;/div&gt;
    ...

Already tried <code>$('span.cls').click(function()</code> and <code>$('#cls').click(function()</code> (after switching the ""span"" with a ""div"" and the class with an ID) no clues. Just a link to click that does nothing. Firebug and IE dev toolbar don't even get into the function.

"<p>how can i specify the <code>a</code> to target to the class <code>contenido_calendario</code> in jquery?</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""col1 sub_section_title""&gt;
    &lt;article&gt;
        &lt;h3 class=""article_header calendari""&gt;2012&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;/article&gt;
    &lt;a href=""#"" class=""button arrow_back_but"" rel=""tooltip"" title=""Click Aquí""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;           
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></p>

<p>this is my code:</p>

<pre><code>$(""a"").click( function() {    
    $("".contenido_calendario"").hide();
    $(this).children("".contenido_calendario"").toggle();
});
</code></pre>

<p>but it doesn´t work</p>
","70393","","<p>If there is in fact something in your anchor tag, you might want to try:</p>

<pre><code>$(this).find("".contenido_calendario"").toggle();
</code></pre>

<p>since <code>.children()</code> only targets <em>direct descendants</em> - and I'm guessing the <code>.contenido_calendario</code> is <em>not</em> a direct descendant of the clicked anchor.</p>

<p>EDIT (based on your comment ""it´s the next div outside 'col1 sub_section_title' div, sorry i put it in the question""):</p>

<pre><code>$(this).closest("".sub_section_title"").next().toggle();

"<p>I'm just trying to scroll to a specific DOM element or absolute position in my browser window, and it's not working. Here's my code:</p>

<pre><code>$(window)._scrollable();

<p>and here's the documentation for the plugin:</p>

     alert(""mydiv contonet is loaded"");

<p>Tell please, how can this make?</p>
","70393","","<p>Divs have no onload event. The best you can do is something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""myDiv""&gt;I am a div&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script&gt;// do stuff with loaded div&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>...unless you can/want to specifically address stuff within the div which does support <code>onload</code>, like images.</p>

"<p>I am using Jquery to animate my text opacity in(from 0 to 1) when you go to any page of my site. Then, on main navigation click, it initializes an animation of the text to fade out, then initializes the link and goes to the next page. However for some reason when you click the main navigation before the text is fully animated in,the text fades out but flickers on full opacity, then loads the link for the next page. I was wondering if someone knew how to correct this, I have the code im using below. I was thinking I need to use queue's somehow but then again im not sure if that would help....Here's the link to my site where you can see it flicker -> www.originalengine.com/test/iindex.html</p>

<p>I start with a 0 opacity in CSS</p>

<pre><code>#AlternateContent{
position: relative;
opacity: 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>then I fade in the text div</p>

<pre><code>$('#AlternateContent').animate({opacity: '1'},{duration: 2650});
</code></pre>

<p>then this is how I check which nav button was pressed, and animate the fadeout:</p>

<pre><code>if (window.location.pathname === '/test/index.html')

{

$('#AboutButton').bind('click', AboutButton);
$('#PortfolioButton').bind('click', PortfolioButton);
$('#ContactButton').bind('click', ContactButton);

} 

function ContactButton(e) { 

$('#AlternateContent').animate({height: 0},{duration: 2650, queue: false}, 'swing')
.animate({opacity: '0'},{duration: 577, queue: false}, function(){
document.getElementById(""AlternateContent"").style.opacity=0;
window.location = 'contact.php';

});
}
</code></pre>

<p>Like I said, this works, but I get a flash at the end. Go to my site ( www.originalengine.com/test/iindex.html ) and check it out, if you press the nav items quickly between pages, while fading out, the text will blink 'on' again before going to the next page, I just want it to completely fade out!!</p>

<p>Thanks in advance</p>
","70393","","<p>Probably because you have two animations running simultaneously. Try:</p>

<pre><code>$('#AlternateContent').stop().animate({height: 0},{duration: 2650, queue: false}, 'swing')

<p>I've got some code that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>$.post(self.baseUrl + 'api/method',

        {param1: data},
        function (response, self) {
            // Do something
        });
</code></pre>

<p>However, it doesn't work like this, the jQuery documentation doesn't show a way that would make this possible and a cursory Google search hasn't turned up anything. Is this possible, and how can I do so?</p>
","70393","","<p>If you use the <a href=""http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/""><code>$.ajax</code></a> method you can specify a context:</p>

<pre><code>$.ajax({

","70393","","<p>Having scanned through the online docs, there is no option to highlight an area on mouse click. That said, it should be pretty straightforward to modify the script to get what you want. Take a look <a href=""https://github.com/kemayo/maphilight/blob/master/jquery.maphilight.js#L318"" rel=""nofollow"">here on line 318</a>:</p>

<pre><code>$(map).trigger('alwaysOn.maphilight').find('area[coords]')
      .bind('mouseover.maphilight', mouseover)
      .bind('mouseout.maphilight', function(e) { clear_canvas(canvas); });
</code></pre>

<p>You could try changing it to this:</p>

<pre><code>$(map).trigger('alwaysOn.maphilight').find('area[coords]')
      .bind('click.maphilight', mouseover)
      .bind('mouseout.maphilight', function(e) { clear_canvas(canvas); });
</code></pre>

<p>I reckon that will do the trick, but it will still clear the canvas when you move the mouse out of the clicked area.</p>

<p>That should be a start.</p>

"<p>I'm using Twitter Bootstrap to create <a href=""http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/javascript.html#tooltips"" rel=""nofollow"">tooltips</a>. Currently, I init the tooltips in <code>$(document).ready()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function() {

<p>This calls <code>tooltip()</code> (which inits the listeners) for every element that has the <code>data-toggle</code> element.</p>

<p>The problem is that if I have dynamic DOM elements (using Ajax), the <code>tooltip()</code> will not be called on them. I thought of a solution like the following:</p>

"<p>First off I'm not 100% sure how to title this page so please edit if you can.</p>

<p>So I'm Learning so jQuery, I want a system that has a number of articles on a page, when the page is first loaded i want the first article to be displayed and all other articles to be reduced to either their heading text or a set height.</p>

<p>Now I have a system that will open and close the containers, it looks like that:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
    jQuery(document).ready(function() {
        jQuery("".content"").hide();

        //toggle the component with class msg_body

        });
    });
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>my Mark up is this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""page_content""&gt;
    &lt;h1 align=""center""&gt;Updates&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;article class=""update_article""&gt;
        &lt;h2 class=""heading""&gt;13/12/2012 - Article Heading&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;div class=""content""&gt;
            Article Body
        &lt;/div&gt;

            Article Body
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/article&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;  
</code></pre>

<p>When this runs, all articles will be reduced to just their headings, once they have been clicked jQuery will open the body.</p>

<p>So I want to know how I would go about firstly opening the first article when the page is loaded, but I would also like for the system to close the open article when a different one is clicked and opened.</p>

<pre><code>window.getSelection().removeAllRanges();

<pre><code>function clearSelection() {

        document.selection.empty();
    } else if(window.getSelection) {

<p>On the page I insert some HTML with jQuery so the DOM changes. For example, I insert a extra element with the class ""tip"" or ""test"".

{

});

<p>I don't understand why, but this way it's working with the manipulated DOM and the jQuery stuff works on the new inserted elements. So my first question is, why does this work and just the click() function not? And the second question, why do I have to point to the ""body""?</p>

<p>Finally, my third question is, how get this done with the tooltip?</p>

","70393","","<blockquote>
  <p>So my first question is, why does this work and just the click()

</blockquote>

<p>Because the event handler is now delegated to a parent element, so it remains even after replacing/manipulating child elements.</p>

<p>Ancient article on event delegation for your perusal - but the concepts remain the same:</p>

<ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>And the second question, why do I have to point to the ""body""</p>

<p>You don't, any suitable parent element will do. For example, any direct parent (a div wrapper, for instance) which does <em>not</em> get replaced.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Finally, my third question is, how get this done with the tooltip?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You need to re-initialize your tooltip plugin on the newly inserted elements. For example:</p>

    $(""#someDiv"").html(html);
    $(""#someDiv"").find("".tip"").tooltip();
});

"<p>I am trying to figure out if there is a way around doing <code>.hasClass()</code> multiple times to see if the active element I am working with has one of currently four specific classes, I am also trying to figure out the most optimized way to do this while the element(s) that are acting as the trigger (or the active element) has multiple classes in it mostly for styling purposes. </p>

<p>Example of the HTML:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""form_row""&gt;
    &lt;div class=""primary_row""&gt;1&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div class=""primary_row subexists""&gt;1&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div class=""secondary_row""&gt;2&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=""form_row""&gt;
    &lt;div class=""primary_row subexists""&gt;1&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div class=""secondary_row_sub""&gt;2a&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<p>I am in the progress of currently building it up, so this is still a rough draft, but its safe to assume more classes will exist on various elements per the need. The Four main classes I am worried about are <code>primary_row, primary_row_sub, secondary_row, secondary_row_sub</code>. I am building a click handler like:</p>

<pre><code>$('.form_row &gt; div').click(function()
{
   //code
});
</code></pre>

<p>in this click handler I want to be able to detect if the element clicked is one of the four mentioned above. Where if it is, I want to do something based on which. So determining which class is of the element clicked, rather than building four click handlers one for each type. I am hoping I can keep it optimized and contained to a single handler. Any ideas?</p>

"<p>My question is driven by curiosity, and I appreciate any performance difference is liable to be minuscule.</p>

<p>I was recently looking at producing some hover effects for an image map. As with most things someone else had suggested a method with jQuery. Below was the suggest code</p>

<pre><code>$('#borders area').each(function(){
    var mapRegion = $(this).attr('class');
    $(this).hover(
        function(){
            $('#regions').addClass(mapRegion).show();
        },
        function(){
            $('#regions').hide().removeClass(mapRegion);
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>This obviously works fine where <code>&lt;div id=""regions""&gt;</code> is positioned absolutely above a base <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> and the a further blank transparent <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> is placed above this for <code>&lt;map id=""borders""&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>I did wonder however if it made more sense (slightly less code) to do the following with the jQuery</p>

<pre><code>$('#borders area').each(function(){
    $(this).hover(
        function(){
            $('#regions').removeClass().addClass($(this).attr('class')).show();
        },
        function(){
            $('#regions').hide();
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>Would this be faster as no variable is set? Does removeClass() work faster without a parameter supplied? I suppose I would also be interested to know which semantically is considered better.</p>

"<p>how do I play with dom with jquery again after the dom is appended by using jquery?
I guess they don't work since they are appended after ""$(document).ready();""</p>

<p>for example:</p>

&lt;/div&gt;

<p>Thank you in advance :)</p>
","70393","","<p><code>this</code> refers to the options object, and not the jQuery object. If you have the one-off field from which you want to extract the primary key to send to the server, then I would simply do:</p>

<pre><code>var $task = $(""#task"");
$task.editable({
    type: 'text',
    pk:  $task.attr(""id""),
    url: '/update_task/' + pk + '/',
    title: 'Enter task',
});
</code></pre>

<p>If you are using a more generic selector, such as <code>.someDiv</code> and want the <code>pk</code> for each individual one, you can use the <code>params</code> option with a callback, which allows you to append/overwrite the data to be sent, depending on whether you pass an object or a function (function overwrites, see the <a href=""http://vitalets.github.io/x-editable/docs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">docs</a>): </p>

<pre><code>$("".someDiv"").editable({
    type: 'text',
    pk:  0,

    // hooray, params takes a callback so
    // we can get the right context
    params: function (params) {
        var data = {};
        data.pk = $(this).closest(""div"").attr(""id""),
        data.makesure = ""You know that this will overwrite the original params object"";
        data.soPut = ""Everything you need into it before returning"";
        return data;
    },
    url: '/update_task/' + pk + '/',
    title: 'Enter task'
});
</code></pre>

<p>p.s. <code>pk</code> seems to accept a function too, so I guess you can do this, but I'm in no position to test right now:</p>

<pre><code>$(""#task"").editable({
    type: 'text',
    pk:  function () {

<p>On the previous jQuery event there is a anonymous function —I think that it's a anonymous function. Correct me if I'm wrong please. In this function there's a parameter 'z' that we can use inside this event to know which key was pressed with .which property. So my questions are:</p>

","70393","","<p>You should refactor your solution to send all the data to the script in one single request. There is really no to execute numerous requests (especially since you own the server code).</p>

<p>To get you started:</p>

<pre><code>var description;
var id;
var dataBuf = [];
$("".description"").live('blur',function() {
   var success;
   var dataType;
   $("".dynamic_row,&lt;?php echo $services; ?&gt;"").each(function() {
      var row = $(this);
      var id = row.find("".id"").val() || 0;
      var description = row.find("".description"").val() || """";
      var q = &lt;?php echo $q; ?&gt;;
      dataBuf.push({""ider"" : id, ""descriptionr"" :description, ""qr"" :q};
    });

    // now send it all as one request:
    $.ajax({
        type: ""POST"",
        url: 'setdescname.php',
        data: {""data"": JSON.stringify(dataBuf)},
        success: function(result) {
        if(result.isOk == false)
            alert(result.message);
        },
        dataType: dataType
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>And on the server:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
$data = json_decode($_POST['data']);
foreach($data as $row) {
    echo $row['ider'];
    echo $row['descriptionr'];
    echo $row['qr'];
    // etc.
    // do stuff with data, store in DB
    // for example
}
</code></pre>

","70393","","<p>Possibly because you are firing too many simultaneous XHR request. Most browsers limit them to something reasonable. One potential solution would be to <em>not</em> fire the event upon every keypress, but incorporate a timer which ensures that the even fires a maximum of once per specified time. You can use this little plugin I made some time ago for that:</p>

<pre><code>(function ($) {
    $.fn.delayEvent = function (event, callback, ms) {
        var timer = 0;
        $(this).on(event, function () {                   
            clearTimeout (timer);
            timer = setTimeout(callback, ms);
        });
        return $(this);
    };
})(jQuery);
</code></pre>

<p>Usage:</p>

<pre><code>$(""#someTextInput"").delayEvent(""keyup"", function () {
    console.log(""I will fire a maximum of once every 500ms"");
}, 500);

"<p>So I've got a scroll event. It does a load of stuff to work out whether something should be moved on the page. When you scroll down, it fires off. If you wheel down, drag, it fires of bazillions and bazillions of times. As you'd expect, perhaps. Here's some simple dummy code to represent the sequence of events.</p>

<pre><code>function scroller() {
    // 1. A really expensive calculation that depends on the scroll position
    // 2. Another expensive calculation to work out where should be now
    // 3. Stop current animations
    // 4. Animate an object to new position based on 1 and 2
}
$(window).on('resize' scroller);
</code></pre>

<p>Don't get me wrong, it's usually <em>accurate</em> so there isn't so much a concurrency issue. My animations <em>inside</em> the event call <code>.stop()</code> (as part #3) so the latest version is always* the right one but it's eating up a lot of CPU. I'd like to be a responsible developer here, not expecting every user to have a quad core i7.</p>

<p>So to my question... <strong>Can I kill off previous calls to my method from a particular event handler?</strong> Is there any way I can interfere with this stack of queued/parallel-running ""processes"" so that when a new one is added to the stack, the old ones are terminated instantly? I'm sure there's a concurrency-minded way of wording this but I can't think of it.</p>

<p><sub>*At least I <em>think</em> that's the case - if the calculations took longer in an earlier run, their animation could be the last one to be called and could cock up the entire run! Hmm. I hadn't thought about that before thinking about it here. Another reason to stop the previous iterations immediately!</sub></p>
","70393","","<p>You can ensure the event is fired a maximum of once per x milliseconds. E.g.:</p>

            clearTimeout (timer);
            timer = setTimeout($.proxy(callback, this, event), ms);
