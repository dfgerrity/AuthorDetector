QUESTION,USERID,USERNAME,ANSWER
"<p>I want to have a abstract view for any type of UI (web or window). In order to do that I must use Interface (IView ) in which I can only apply just rules about view. In fact, I want to set a some basic comple function to provide to its inheritances.</p>

<p>So in this way, I must use abstract class. The problem is</p>

<p>1) Interface only have rules
2) The view (web form or window form) can't inherit any more since that's already inherited from window or web form</p>

<p>How can I do that?
Many thanks</p>
","34211","Andrew Hare","<p>Will the functions you add change the definition of what the class is, or will you simply be creating functions to manipulate data that is already a part of the class?</p>

<p>If you need to redefine aspects of the base class of these two classes then yes, you will need to change your inheritance structure.  But if the functions will simply manipulate data that is already part of the class now then I would suggest you use the interface and create utility functions.</p>

<p>Here is a clumsy example of what I mean:</p>

<pre><code>using System;

abstract class Pet { }

class Dog : Pet, IPet
{
    public String Name { get; set; }
    public Int32 Age { get; set; }
}

class Cat : Pet, IPet
{
    public String Name { get; set; }
    public Int32 Age { get; set; }
}

interface IPet
{
    String Name { get; set; }
    Int32 Age { get; set; }
}

static class PetUtils
{
    public static void Print(this IPet pet)
    {
    	Console.WriteLine(pet.Name + "" is "" + pet.Age);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Your two UI classes are perhaps related in this way.  I would imagine that what you need to do in a cross-cutting fashion would be solved by a utility method like the one I have created.  I did create the <code>PetUtils.Print</code> method as an extension method as this will create the expressive illusion of an instance method.  If you are not using C# 3 just remove ""<code>this</code>"" from <code>public static void Print(this IPet pet)</code>.</p>

"<p>I have a list of objects implementing an interface, and a list of that interface:</p>

<pre><code>public interface IAM
{
    int ID { get; set; }

{
     public int ID { get; set; }

     //save the object
     }

<p>The previous code doesn't compile because the compiler requires all the interface members to be public.</p>

<pre><code>internal void Save(){
</code></pre>

<p>But i don't want to allow the from outside my DLL to save the <code>ConcreteIAM</code>, it only should be saved through the <code>MyList</code>.</p>

<p>Any way to do this?</p>

<p><strong>Update#1</strong>: Hi all, thanks for the answers so far, but none of them is exactly what i need:</p>

<p>The interface needs to be public because it is the signature the client from outside the dll will use, along with <code>ID</code> and other properties i didn't bother to write in the example to keep it simple.</p>

<p>Andrew, I don't think the solution is create a factory to create another object that will contain the <code>IAM</code> members + Save. I am still thinking... Any other ideas?</p>
","34211","Andrew Hare","<p>I think the best thing to do would be to break the internal and public members into two separate interfaces.  If you inherit the interfaces you can still declare the members publicly but the visibility of the internal members will be dictated by the visibility of the interface itself.</p>

"<p>Suppose I have a method that takes an object of some kind as an argument.  Now say that if this method is  passed a null argument, it's a fatal error and an exception should be thrown.  Is it worth it for me to code something like this (keeping in mind this is a trivial example):</p>

<p>Secondly, suppose that someMethod is a constructor and x won't be used until another method is called.  Should I throw the exception immediately or wait until x is needed and throw the exception then?</p>
","34211","Andrew Hare","<p>I agree with the idea of failing fast - however it is wise to know why failing fast is practical.  Consider this example:</p>

<p>If you rely on the <code>NullReferenceException</code> to tell you that something was wrong, how will you know what was null?  The stack trace will only give you a line number, not which reference was null.  In this example <code>x</code> or <code>x.Property</code> could both have been null and without failing fast with aggressive checking beforehand, you will not know which it is.</p>

"<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>I have made a Web Service in Visual Studio, and I'm trying to consume it using the automatically generated proxy class. The Web Service returns a class that I have implemented, containing a List.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>The proxy class has automatically generated methods to send the SOAP to the web service. It uses the Invoke() method to execute the call, and then casts the result as a DataSet. How can I get this object back into the class I know it is?</p>

<p>I know that I can hand-edit the auto-generated file, but that's not very maintainable, so I don't want to go down that route (any time the Web Service is rebuilt, the changes would have to be made again).</p>

<p>Is there a way to tell the generated class to be more specific, and actually use the correct data type? Or do I have to write a clunky set of deserialisers to get my data back into the correct shape?</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>One method in my Web Service class:</p>

<pre><code>[WebMethod]
public UpdateList RetrieveUpdates(long sessionID, string configurationVersion, string coreVersion, string researcherDBVersion)
{ ... }
</code></pre>

<p>Adding the class as a Web Reference generates the following proxy method:</p>

<pre><code>public DataSet RetrieveUpdates(long sessionID, string configurationVersion, string coreVersion, string researcherDBVersion) {
    object[] results = this.Invoke(""RetrieveUpdates"", new object[] {
        sessionID,
        configurationVersion,
        coreVersion,
        researcherDBVersion});
   return ((DataSet)(results[0]));
}
</code></pre>

<p>The DataSet I receive from this method is always empty (because you can't cast from my class to a DataSet).</p>

<p>Thanks in advance</p>
","34211","Andrew Hare","<p>Unless your client code knows about your custom class (e.g. has a reference to the assembly) you will not be able to retrieve an object of that type from the service.</p>

<p>It sounds like what you are looking to do is share types across a service layer.  In order to do that you will either have to give your client app a copy of the assembly that has the 
<code>UpdateList</code> type or you will need to look at something like WCF.</p>

"<p>I have a row of divs that must all be the same height, but I have no way of knowing what that height might be ahead of time (the content comes from an external source). I initially tried placing the divs in an enclosing div and floated them left. I then set their height to be ""100%"", but this had no perceptible effect. By setting the height on the enclosing div to a fixed-height I could then get the floated divs to expand, but only up to the fixed height of the container. When the content in one of the divs exceeded the fixed height, it spilled over; the floated divs refused to expand.</p>

<p>I Googled this floated-divs-of-the-same-height problem and apparently there's no way to do it using CSS. So now I am trying to use a combination of relative and absolute positioning instead of floats. This is the CSS:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;style type=""text/css""&gt;
div.container {
  background: #ccc;
  position: relative;
  min-height: 10em;
}
div.a {
  background-color: #aaa;
  position: absolute;
  top: 0px;
  left: 0px;
  bottom: 0px;
  width: 40%;
}
div.b {
  background-color: #bbb;
  position: absolute;
  top: 0px;
  left: 41%;
  bottom: 0px;
  width: 40%;
}
&lt;/style&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This is a simplified version of the HTML:</p>

<pre><code>   &lt;div class=""container""&gt;
    &lt;div class=""a""&gt;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Integer pretium dui sit amet felis. Integer sit amet diam. Phasellus ultrices viverra velit.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=""b""&gt;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Integer pretium dui sit amet felis. Integer sit amet diam. Phasellus ultrices viverra velit. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Integer pretium dui sit amet felis. Integer sit amet diam. Phasellus ultrices viverra velit.&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This works, unless you change the min-height to something like 5em (demonstranting what happens when the content exceeds the minimum height), and you can see that while the text doesn't get cutoff, the divs still refuse to expand. Now I am at a lose. Is there any way to do this using CSS?</p>
","34211","Andrew Hare","<p>Here is one of those moments where you can get stuck between being idealistic or realistic.  I understand that there is no semantic value to placing non-tabular data in a table strictly for formatting reasons but I don't want to see you bending over backwards to create a non-tabular solution to this problem simply for its own sake.</p>

<p>I am the first to shoot down non-semantic designs, trust me, but sometimes you need to face the fact that CSS + semantic markup does not work for all design scenarios.  I don't know the accessibility needs of this site but I would recommend that you look to a more practical solution to this problem.</p>

<p>Cheers to you for approaching this the right way and looking for the proper way to solve it!  Unfortunately this is one of the dark corners of CSS (along with vertical positioning within a block) that is just plain impossible to do without faux columns, javascript, or table cells.</p>

<p>Whichever you choose, please don't adhere to a standard for its own sake.</p>

"<p>I was working with the Action Delegates in C# in the hope of learning more about them and thinking where they might be useful.</p>

<p>Has anybody used the Action Delegate, and if so why? or could you give some examples where it might be useful?</p>

<p>Notice that the foreach method iterates the collection of names and executes the <code>print</code> method against each member of the collection.

<p>Take <code>3.Days().FromNow()</code> as an example.  This is wonderfully expressive and anyone could read this code and tell you exactly what it does.  That is a truly beautiful thing. As coders it is our joy to write code that is self-describing and expressive so that it requires almost no comments and is a pleasure to read.  This code is paramount in that respect.</p>

<p>However, as coders we are also responsible to posterity, and those who come after us will spend most of their time trying to comprehend how this code works.  We must be careful not to be so expressive that debugging our code requires leaping around amongst a myriad of extension methods. </p>

"<p>Is there a best practice for instantiating / calling business logic layer service in a web app?  I've got a large number services that I keep instantiating and then disposing for just one method call.  </p>

","34211","Andrew Hare","<p>I always find it best to have loose coupling between application tiers so I would recommend that you introduce some level of abstraction between your service client code (<code>ProductService</code>) and the code that calls it.  </p>

<p>In a lot of cases (I am not sure if this is your case) any given team may access any other tier of the application in a product-like way.  In other words, another team may own the business layer and could potentially introduce breaking changes into your tier's code.</p>

<p>I would recommend that you create a service client factory for instantiating client objects and return custom interface types from your factory that only expose the members you choose.

"<p>What are the different types of encapsulation?</p>

<p>Am I right in thinking this basically refers to central OO concepts such as Abstraction, Polymorphism and Inheritance?</p>

<p>My understanding of encapsulation is that it is a method of hiding data / functionality, but I never really considered Polymorphism or Inheritance a form of encapsulation, although I can see how polymorphism could be considered encapsulation as it can hide the exact type of the object you are interacting with.</p>

<p>So, would you say that's about it, or am I missing some core concepts?</p>

<p><em>edit</em> I just noticed in the comments someone mentioned it could refer to private / public methods, perhaps I'm thinking in to the question too much and expecting a more complicated answer than it really is?</p>
","34211","Andrew Hare","<p>Since encapsulation simply refers to ""information hiding"" then I would imagine that a lot of things can be categorized as encapsulation.  However I tend to think of encapsulation as ""implementation hiding"", in other words it is a tool that I use to create loose coupling between anything I write and anything client of what I have written.</p>

<p>So I tend to believe, pragmatically, that encapsulation is any paradigm or best-practice that allows me to present a clean, solid interface to any client.</p>

"<p>What are the real differences between anonymous type(var) in c# 3.0 and dynamic type(dynamic) that is coming in c# 4.0?</p>
","34211","Andrew Hare","<p>An anonymous type is a real, compiler-generated type that is created for you.  The good thing about this is that the compiler can re-use this type later for other operations that require it as it is a POCO.</p>

<p>My understanding of dynamic types is that they are late-bound, meaning that the CLR (or DLR) will evaluate the object at execution time and then use duck typing to allow or disallow member access to the object.</p>

<p>So I guess the difference is that anonymous types are true POCOs that the compiler can see but you can only use and dynamic types are late-bound dynamic objects.</p>

","34211","Andrew Hare","<h2>When does using extension methods make sense?</h2>

<p>They make sense when you are using LINQ and want to chain or pipe functional output from one function to another.  It improves the readability of the code and allows you to express a concept more elegantly (whatever that is worth).</p>

<p>They also allow you to give the appearance of instance methods on any type you like without modifying the source of that type, this can often help readability and the expressiveness of your code when it is used reasonably</p>

"<p>In working with objects and interfaces what is the best practice for writing to the database? There is a plethora of opinions regarding the object design but I am unclear about the database end. A simple example: </p>

<p>Suppose a Contact base class that contains the common fields such as contact name (Bill, Fred, Sally) and a location (home, work, etc.). Add an IPhone interface (area code, phone number, extension) and an IEmail interface (email address,cc) to abstract out the differences. Then create classes (Phone, Email) that inherit from these as thus:</p>

<pre>
    Phone: Contact, IPhone 
    Email: Contact, IEMail

","34211","Andrew Hare","<p>I guess you need to consider the relationship between these three entities.  Say the following statements out loud and see which is true for your application:</p>

"<p>One advantage of lambda expressions is that you have to evaluate a function only when you need its result.</p>

{
    if (writer != null)
    {
        writer.WriteLine(text());

<pre><code>PrintLine(""Some text"", Console.Out);
</code></pre>

<p>and have to call it this way:</p>

<pre><code>PrintLine(() =&gt; ""Some text"", Console.Out);
</code></pre>

<p>The compiler is not able to ""infer"" a parameterless function from the passed constant. Are there any plans to improve this in future versions of C# or am I missing something?</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>I just found a dirty hack myself:</p>

<pre><code>    public class F&lt;T&gt;
    {
       private readonly T value;
       private readonly Func&lt;T&gt; func;

       public F(T value) { this.value = value; }
       public F(Func&lt;T&gt; func) {this.func = func; }

       public static implicit operator F&lt;T&gt;(T value)
       {
            return new F&lt;T&gt;(value);
       }

       public static implicit operator F&lt;T&gt;(Func&lt;T&gt; func)
       {
           return new F&lt;T&gt;(func);
       }

       public T Eval()
       {
           return this.func != null ? this.func() : this.value;
       }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now i can just define the function as:</p>

<pre><code>public static void PrintLine(F&lt;string&gt; text, TextWriter writer)
{
    if (writer != null)
    {
        writer.WriteLine(text.Eval());
    }
}

<p>and call it both with a function or a value.</p>
","34211","Andrew Hare","<p>The compiler is very good at inferring <em>types</em>, it is not good at inferring <em>intent</em>.  One of the tricky things about all the new syntactic sugar in C# 3 is that they can lead to confusion as to what exactly the compiler does with them.</p>

<p>Consider your example:</p>

<pre><code>() =&gt; ""SomeText""
</code></pre>

<p>The compiler sees this and understands that you intend to create an anonymous function that takes no parameters and returns a type of System.String.  This is all inferred from the lambda expression you gave it.  In reality your lambda gets compiled to this:</p>

    return ""SomeText"";
};

<p>and it is a delegate to this anonymous function that you are sending to <code>PrintLine</code> for execution.</p>

"<p>It's been a while since I wrote html full-time ;-p</p>

<p>In the modern era of css etc, what is the preferred way of creating a pair of panels (for example, a preview window like in Outlook, or for master/detail views)? Ideally where the top (master) pane would get scrollbars etc?</p>

<p>The intended use-case is so that a user can scroll in the top window while always being able to see the preview / detail window (I intend to load data for the selected row into the bottom panel via jQuery).</p>

<p>In the old world (table layouts), I might have something like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;table height=""100%"" border=""1"" width=""100%""&gt;
&lt;tr height=""*""&gt;&lt;td&gt;master&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

","34211","Andrew Hare","<p>There are lots of good ways to do this - you could use any block level element (like a div) with <code>overflow:scroll</code>.  This would allow you do do what you want without resorting to something complicated like frames (unless that is what you need).</p>

"<p>I am a hobbyist programmer and am trying to improve my skills. To that end, I have been reading 'The Pragmatic Programmer' and 'Code Complete' as recommended by some in this forum and I have to say that it has improved my approach and skills. That said, one aspect of programming I am struggling with is the 'Don't Repeat Yourself' (DRY) mantra espoused in 'The Pragmatic Programmer' and echoed in Code Complete. Let me explain.</p>

<p>I recently wrote a small (~2500 lines of code) software program for a friend. Armed with my new knowledge from the books I have been reading I resisted the temptation to write code straight away but instead took some time (~3 days) to design my software in an abstract way e.g. what does the software need to achieve, what does the end user require etc.</p>

<p>Having done my design I then wrote down the the core functions / procedures that I would need to deliver the software e.g. IsFileOpen(), getEmployeeName(), WriteAddressToDatabase() etc. I felt pleased with this and happily set on my way coding.</p>

<p>Half way through my coding I realised that there were functions / procedures that I required that weren't in my initial draft. On the fly I would add these functions / procedures. However, after a day or so I'd realise that the new functions / procedures that I had added had a lot of code repetition. So I'd try and make a generic function / procedure with additional input parameters to handle the nuances of different situations. </p>

<p>What struck me is that this process is almost an infinite loop i.e. you can just go on and on condensing code to remove repetitions. Also, it seems to me very difficult to plan so thoroughly in advance that you know all the functions / procedures that you will need and remove all the repetitions before hand. My questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Am I really just not doing enough
initial planning of my software
design and this is why I keep having
to add new functions / procedures?</li>
<li>Or is this a common experience that
you just get better at over time?</li>
<li>There seems to me a contradiction
between 'The Pragmatic Programmer'
and 'Code Complete'. The former
suggests the 'DRY' principle whereas
the latter seems to suggest building
functions / procedures that only do
one thing i.e. don't build functions
that return two or three different
things. So, as an example, suppose I
have a data table with three
variables ('Employee Name', 'Age',
'Salary') and I want to retrieve
each one at different times. Then
'Code Complete' says build three
functions [ getEmpName(), getAge(),
getSalary() ] to keep each function specific whereas 'The Pragmatic
Programmer' says there is repetition
in that code and one should build a
single function getEmpDetails(Name,
Age, Salary) which would return the
variable you want.</li>
</ol>

<p>For clarity, I am only half way through 'Code Complete' so maybe there is an answer to resolve the contradiction later in the book. Can anybody give me some guidance please.</p>

","34211","Andrew Hare","<p>Any good writer will tell you the importance of the ""Crappy First Draft"".  A writer named Anne Lamott wrote an <a href=""http://buddha-rat.squarespace.com/shitty-first-drafts/"" rel=""nofollow"">essay explaining this concept</a>.  Basically the idea is that you write something just to get the ideas out of your head an somewhere you can see them in a concrete fashion so that you can then chip away the bad and refine the good.</p>

<p>Coding is a lot like writing in this way, and that is why I would suggest you do a bit less designing up front and get your hands dirty on the code itself.  A quick-and-dirty <strong>prototype</strong> of your final product will show you some of the places you may have missed in a design session.  As you become more experienced you will begin to be able to foresee these areas and there will be less surprises.</p>

<p>I don't want to detract from the concepts you learned in ""Code Complete"" and ""The Pragmatic Programmer"".  These are great concepts and <em>must</em> be used when designing systems.  However until you become more comfortable with this approach I would suggest you take the 3 days you would normally use to design the system and split it in half.  Use half of that time to lay down a good design to the best of your abilities.  Then take the other half of the time to bang out a prototype to see if there is anything that your design does not account for.</p>

"<p>What is the difference between storing a datatable in Session v.s Cache?  Advantages and disadvantages?</p>

<p>So if it is a simple search page which returns results in a datatable and binds to a gridview.  If user a searches and user b searches, is it better to store it in Session since each user would most likely have different results or can I still store each of their searches in Cache or does that not make sense since there is only one cache.  I guess basically what I am trying to say is that would the Cache be overwritten.</p>
","34211","Andrew Hare","<p>Well it depends on how you have session configured for ASP.NET.  Are you storing session in a database or in memory?  If in memory are you using a separate server or are you using the current webserver for session?</p>

<p>Depending on how things are set up for you there may be performance implications when you are using something like a datatable which tells me that you are perhaps storing large amounts of data.</p>

<p>Also Session is stored per user and is retrieved per user by means of their Session ticket that is stored either in a Session cookie or on the URL if they do not accept cookies and you have set up ASP.NET to cookieless mode.  Anything that you cache will be cached at the application level and will be available to all user sessions which may or may not be what you want.</p>

"<p>I'm having a hard time trying to get my team comfortable with interface based programming ... anyone have some suggestions?</p>
","34211","Andrew Hare","<p>I would suggest you show them the benefits that can come from it.  Imagine this C# scenario:</p>

<pre><code>class User
{
    public String GetFirstName() { return ""foo""; }
}

class App
{
    void Run()
    {
    	User user = new User();
    	String firstName = user.GetFirstName();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here we have a <code>User</code> class that will go and get a first name from somewhere and return it.  Now your app is coupled to this class and it will be difficult to later change where you get first name from because you have used the <code>User</code> class everywhere.  What would happen if you implemented a service and wanted to begin calling that service for the <code>FirstName</code> value?  You would have a bit of refactoring to do.</p>

<p>Consider this approach:</p>

<pre><code>interface IUser
{
    String GetFirstName();
}

class User : IUser
{
    public String GetFirstName() { return ""foo""; }
}

static class UserFactory
{
    public static IUser GetUser() { return new User(); }
}

class App
{
    void Run()
    {
    	IUser user = UserFactory.GetUser();
    	String firstName = user.GetFirstName();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can implement the interface in any class you want like:</p>

<pre><code>class UserService : IUser
{
    public String GetFirstName() { return ""bar""; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>and just change the factory method like:</p>

<pre><code>static class UserFactory
{
    public static IUser GetUser() { return new UserService(); }
}
</code></pre>

<p>and your app code will be none the wiser.  </p>

"<p>Greetings stackers,</p>

<p>I'm trying to come up with the best database schema for an application that lets users create surveys and present them to the public. There are a bunch of ""standard"" demographic fields that most surveys (but not all) will include, like First Name, Last Name, etc. And of course users can create an unlimited number of ""custom"" questions.</p>

<p>The first thing I thought of is something like this:</p>

<pre><code>Survey
  ID
  SurveyName

SurveyQuestions
  SurveyID
  Question

Responses
  SurveyID
  SubmitTime

ResponseAnswers
  SurveyID
  Question
  Answer
</code></pre>

<p>But that's going to suck every time I want to query data out. And it seems dangerously close to <a href=""http://thedailywtf.com/Articles/The_Inner-Platform_Effect.aspx"">Inner Platform Effect</a></p>

<p>An improvement would be to include as many fields as I can think of in advance in the responses table:</p>

<pre><code>Responses
  SurveyID
  SubmitTime
  FirstName
  LastName
  Birthdate
  [...]
</code></pre>

<p>Then at least queries for data from these common columns is straightforward, and I can query, say, the average age of everyone who ever answered any survey where they gave their birthdate.</p>

<p>But it seems like this will complicate the code a bit. Now to see which questions are asked in a survey I have to check which common response fields are enabled (using, I guess, a bitfield in Survey) AND what's in the SurveyQuestions table. And I have to worry about special cases, like if someone tries to create a ""custom"" question that duplicates a ""common"" question in the Responses table.</p>

<p>Is this the best I can do? Am I missing something?</p>
","34211","Andrew Hare","<p>I would suggest you always take a normalized approach to your database schema and then later decided if you need to create a solution for performance reasons.  Premature optimization can be dangerous.  Premature database de-normalization can be disastrous!</p>

"<p>When employing custom attributes to store meta-data, is it best to decorate the interface, or the class that implements the interface, assuming that any class that implements the interface would have the same data in the attribute?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Basically i'm writing a custom data storage mechanism for a project, and the objects represent the various tables being stored. The custom attribute is used to designate which table in the dataset is used to store the objects of that class, and also to identify which tables are involved in a n:m relationship.</p>

<p>So if i put the attributes on the interface, is this a clearer approach, or does it clutter the interface and make accessing the data itself more cumbersome?</p>
","34211","Andrew Hare","<p>Well it depends on whether or not the interface has anything to do with the metadata.</p>

<pre><code>interface IRunnable
{
    void Run();
}

class Test : IRunnable
{
    public void Run() { }
}
</code></pre>

<p>In this example it would make sense to put the attributes on the interface if they pertain to the intent of the interface.  If the attributes are applicable across all implementations then put the attributes on the interface.</p>

<p>However if the attributes have nothing to do with the ""runnability"" (with ""runnability"" pertaining to <code>IRunnable</code> not the CLR) of the class then put the attributes on the class.</p>

"<p>When working with namespaces such as System.Data.Odbc or System.Data.OracleClient the various data reader methods generally require an integer corresponding to a column be provided to the functions (e.g. <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.oracleclient.oracledatareader.getint32.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">OracleDataReader.GetInt32</a>). </p>

<p>My question is this, what is the best way to work with these functions so that the code is fairly self-documenting. Right now, it seems to me that there are three options, namely:</p>

<pre><code>// Option One - Just provide the integer value
string myString = oraData.GetString[0];

// Option Two - Provide the integer value using a constant
string myString = oraData.GetString[FIELD_NAME];

// Option Three - Provide the column name and use System.Convert to return the correct value
string myString = Convert.ToString(oraData[""Field_Name""]);

"<p>Just a quick database design question: Do you ALWAYS use an ID field in EVERY table, or just most of them?  Clearly most of your tables will benefit, but are there ever tables that you might not want to use an ID field?  </p>

<p>For example, I want to add the ability to add tags to objects in another table (foo).  So I've got a table FooTag with a varchar field to hold the tag, and a fooID field to refer to the row in foo.  Do I really need to create a clustered index around an essentially arbitrary ID field?  Wouldn't it be more efficient to use fooID and my text field as the clustered index, since I will almost always be searching by fooID anyway?  Plus using my text in the clustered index would keep the data sorted, making sorting easier when I have to query my data.  The downside is that inserts would take longer, but wouldn't that be offset by the gains during selection, which would happen far more often?</p>

<p>What are your thoughts on ID fields?  Bendable rule, or unbreakable law?</p>

<p>edit: I am aware that the example provided is not normalized.  If tagging is to be a major part of the project, with multiple tables being tagged, and other 'extras', a two-table solution would be a clear answer.  However in this simplest case, would normalization be worthwhile?  It would save some space, but require an extra join when running queries</p>
","34211","Andrew Hare","<p>If you need to retrieve records from that table with unique id then yes.  If you will retrieve them by some other composite key made up of foreign keys then no.  The last thing you need is fields, data, and indexes that you do not use.</p>

"<p>I often find myself writing a property that is evaluated lazily. Something like:</p>

<pre><code>if (backingField == null) 
  backingField = SomeOperation();
return backingField;
</code></pre>

<p>It is not much code, but it does get repeated a lot if you have a lot of properties.</p>

<p>I am thinking about defining a class called LazyProperty:</p>

<pre><code>public class LazyProperty&lt;T&gt;
    {
    private readonly Func&lt;T&gt; getter;

    public LazyProperty(Func&lt;T&gt; getter)
    {
        this.getter = getter;
    }

    private bool loaded = false;
    private T propertyValue;

    public T Value
    {
        get
        {
            if (!loaded)
            {
                propertyValue = getter();
                loaded = true;
            }
            return propertyValue;
        }
    }

    public static implicit operator T(LazyProperty&lt;T&gt; rhs)
    {
        return rhs.Value;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This would enable me to initialize a field like this:</p>

<pre><code>first = new LazyProperty&lt;HeavyObject&gt;(() =&gt; new HeavyObject { MyProperty = Value });
</code></pre>

<p>And then the body of the property could be reduced to:</p>

<pre><code>public HeavyObject First { get { return first; } }
</code></pre>

<p>This would be used by most of the company, since it would go into a common class library shared by most of our products.</p>

<p>I cannot decide whether this is a good idea or not. I think the solutions has some pros, like: </p>

<ul><li>Less code</li>
<li>Prettier code</li>
</ul>

<p>On the downside, it would be harder to look at the code and determine exactly what happens - especially if a developer is not familiar with the LazyProperty class. </p>

<p>What do you think ? Is this a good idea or should I abandon it ? 
Also, is the implicit operator a good idea, or would you prefer to use the Value property explicitly if you should be using this class ? </p>

<p>Opinions and suggestions are welcomed :-)</p>
","34211","Andrew Hare","<p>I like your solution as it is very clever but I don't think you win much by using it.  Lazy loading a private field in a public property is definitely a place where code can be duplicated.  However this has always struck me as a pattern to use rather than code that needs to be refactored into a common place.</p>

<p>Your approach may become a concern in the future if you do any serialization.  Also it is more confusing initially to understand what you are doing with the custom type.</p>

<p>Overall I applaud your attempt and appreciate its cleverness but would suggest that you revert to your original solution for the reasons stated above.</p>

","34211","Andrew Hare","<p>Since you are using .NET I would strongly recommend that you match the convention of the .NET framework.  This will keep your code consistent with the framework.</p>

<p><strong>Clarification:</strong> I cannot read line-by-line because it can span multiple lines.</p>
","34211","Andrew Hare","<p>This depends on the file and the regex.  The best thing you could do would be to read the file in line by line but if that does not work for your situation then might get stuck with pulling the whole file into memory.</p>

<p>Lets say for example that this is your file:</p>

<pre><code>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur
adipiscing elit. Ut fringilla pede blandit
eros sagittis viverra. Curabitur facilisis
urna ABC elementum lacus molestie aliquet.
Vestibulum lobortis semper risus. Etiam
sollicitudin. Vivamus posuere mauris eu
nulla. Nunc nisi. Curabitur fringilla fringilla
elit. Nullam feugiat, metus et suscipit
fermentum, mauris ipsum blandit purus,
non vehicula purus felis sit amet tortor.
Vestibulum odio. Mauris dapibus ultricies
metus. Cras XYZ eu lectus. Cras elit turpis,
ultrices nec, commodo eu, sodales non, erat.
Quisque accumsan, nunc nec porttitor vulputate,
erat dolor suscipit quam, a tristique justo
turpis at erat.
</code></pre>

<p>And this was your regex:</p>

<pre><code>consectetur(?=\sadipiscing)
</code></pre>

<p>Now this regex uses <a href=""http://www.regular-expressions.info/lookaround.html"" rel=""nofollow"">positive lookahead</a> and will only match a string of ""consectetur"" if it is immediately followed by any whitepace character and then a string of ""adipiscing"".</p>

<p>So in this example you would have to read the whole file into memory because your regex is depending on the entire file being parsed as a single string.  This is one of many examples that would require you to have your entire string in memory for a particular regex to work.</p>

<p>I guess the unfortunate answer is that it all depends on your situation.</p>

"<p>This came up in a conversation I was having online, and it occured to me that I have no idea how this is supposed to work: Quite a lot of programmers seem to just take as a given- indeed, obvious that classes are a necessary language feature for managing huge software projects.</p>

<p>It's not obvious to me how they do this.</p>

<p>My question to you is, how do you know? What objective measures are there that show that classes increase productivity, code reuse, and reduce the complexity of the production of a program? What aspects of classes make them ideal for large teams to collaborate on?</p>

<p>And now, there's a question I would like to ask, that is somewhat difficult to express. I'm sorry if I get this wrong and end up confusing or angering anyone:</p>

<p>Objectively, how do you know that the use of classes is not the cause of the application being large to begin with? That is, is it possible that a program with equivalent function could have been written, with much less code, small enough to not need any special measures to ""manage"" it, using some other code re-use strategy? (there are lots to choose from, such as those in functional programming paradigms, or aspect oriented programming). </p>

<p>That last bit is something that Steve Yegge has been hinting at on his blog. But I'm kind of sceptical of both sides of the argument, due to a real lack of any hard data from anyone, and not enough experience to come to a conclusion on my own.</p>

<p>What do you think?</p>

<p>edit: In particular I'm interested in why many programmers think prototypal style inheritance is not up to the task when it comes to large applications. I'm sorry of this question is vague- it's a product of my lack of understanding about this topic.</p>

<p>edit2: there seems to be some confusion over what I mean by functional programming. (I don't think any version of VB was ever functional, certainly not older versions). Please refer to the wikipedia article.
<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming</a></p>

<p>edit3: and let me emphasize that I'm looking for Objective measures. Not subjective opinions.</p>
","34211","Andrew Hare","<p>This is a very good question.  Organizing code into classes is one way for a development team to create small, reusable modules.  Also these modules have expressive and limited interfaces that express only what the class is capable of and not how it does it.  Each class is orthogonal to the others and is therefore highly testable and modular in case of error.</p>

<p>Now what I have just described is a strange scene from a perfect world.  But any good developer doing OOP work ought to be striving for something like this.  </p>

<p>OOP is an acknowledgment that we, the developers, are simply human and cannot comprehend an entire system at once.  So we break the system up into tiny reusable parts and focus on those.</p>

<p>Take a ten-digit US phone number as an example.  It is difficult to remember a ten digit number in you head so we do what psychologists call ""chunking"".  This means we mentally break down the numbers into chunks that we can better remember.</p>

<p>So <code>1234567890</code> becomes <code>123-456-7890</code>.  Fortunately for us, the phone companies also break these numbers down the same way and assign the chunks meaning.  <code>123</code> is the area code, <code>456</code> is the prefix, and <code>7890</code> is the line number.  Each of these chunks is like a class, they all have individual responsibilities, formats, and meanings.  </p>

<p>So in conclusion the best thing I can say is that OOP allows us to build large, scalable systems that have centralized and encapsulated functionality.  It allows us to not have to see the big picture all the time and be able to focus on doing one thing and doing it well. </p>

"<p>In JavaScript, I know that a closure is can be defined as a nested function that has access to its containing function's variables. For example:</p>

<pre><code>function outerFunction(x, y) {
    function innerFunction() {
        return x + y + 10;
    }
    return innerFunction;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, the following code is wiring up a callback for the <code>onreadystatechange</code> property of the request object; however, <strong>I was wondering if, by definition, this is also considered to be a closure</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>/* This is a contrived example, I know. 
 * Bear with me - it demonstrates the point I'm trying to convey. */

function submitHandler() {

    var oRequest = createRequest(); // assume I'm getting an instance of the xhr
    var sUsername = 'Tom';          // assume this is needed for work in the handler
    var This = this;
    oRequest.onreadystatechange = function() {
        This.handleResponse(oRequest, sUsername)
    }

}

function handleResponse(oResponse, sUsername) {
    if(oResponse.readyState === 4 &amp;&amp; oResponse.status === 200) {
        // do work with the username
    } else {
        // we're not done yet...
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I realize that the <code>handleResponse</code> function could also just be written as an anonymous function in the context of <code>submitHandler</code>, but I find that more complex Ajax code can be more readable and easily maintained if callbacks are defined outside the scope of the function calling back to them.

The more I think about it the more I think from a usability standpoint, it is better to hide the parent from anyone using the child class.  That way when you are creating an object from the child class, you don't have to know anything about the parent class.</p>
","34211","Andrew Hare","<p>Since this is a <code>HAS-A</code> relationship between your two classes then I think you ought to leave it as is.  You don't need to introduce encapsulating code for something that does not need it.</p>

<p>Here is a pseudo-code example:</p>

<pre><code>class Engine
    [method] start()

class Car
    [property] Engine

<p>Ideally you would want to reference <code>Engine</code> as a property of <code>Car</code> like so:</p>

<pre><code>Car.Engine.start()
</code></pre>

<p>The alternative would be to write extra code in <code>Car</code> to wrap the methods in <code>Engine</code>.  While you can do this it doesn't make much sense as you will be simply writing pass-through methods from <code>Car</code> to <code>Engine</code>.</p>

"<p>I have an aspx page that uses a master page.  On this page I have a group of radio buttons.  I need to get at the checked property for each of the elements in the radio button group in javascript.  Before the page was converted to use a master page, the following javascript code worked just fine:</p>

<pre><code>if((!f.rblRegUseVehicles[0].checked) &amp;&amp; (!f.rblRegUseVehicles[1].checked))
{
    isValid = ""false"";
}
</code></pre>

<p>f is the reference to the form.  This worked just fine.</p>

<p>When the page was chanded to use a Master Page, I changed the javascript to the following:</p>

<pre><code>if((!f.&lt;%=rblRegUseVehicles.ClientID%&gt;[0].checked) &amp;&amp; (!f.&lt;%=rblRegUseVehicles.ClientID%&gt;[1].checked))
{
    isValid = ""false"";
}

<p>Now, the javascript is failing because it can't find the element.  In the ""View Source"" I have elements with the name:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input id=""ctl00_cphContent_rblRegUseVehicles_0"" type=""radio"" name=""ctl00$cphContent$rblRegUseVehicles"" value=""Yes"" /&gt;

","34211","Andrew Hare","<p>This is a part of ASP.NET that has always been difficult.  You need to have static javascript that references dynamically created element ids!</p>

<p>This is how I have always solved the problem:</p>

<p>Wrap your <code>RadioButtonList</code> in a <code>div</code> or <code>p</code> or whatever you want:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""yourId""&gt;
    &lt;asp:RadioButtonList id=""radiolist1"" runat=""server""&gt;
    	&lt;!-- ... --&gt;
    &lt;/asp:RadioButtonList&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Which renders to something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""yourId""&gt;
    &lt;table id=""radiolist1"" border=""0""&gt;
    	&lt;tr&gt;
    		&lt;td&gt;
    			&lt;input id=""radiolist1_0"" type=""radio"" name=""radiolist1"" value=""Item 1"" checked=""checked"" /&gt;
    			&lt;label for=""radiolist1_0""&gt;Item 1&lt;/label&gt;
    		&lt;/td&gt;
    	&lt;/tr&gt;
    	&lt;tr&gt;
    		&lt;td&gt;
    			&lt;input id=""radiolist1_1"" type=""radio"" name=""radiolist1"" value=""Item 2"" /&gt;

    		&lt;/td&gt;
    	&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<p>And this would allow you to have a static javascript function that targets <code>yourId</code> which doesn't get <code>runat=""server""</code>.  Then your javascript would look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>var rbl = document.getElementById(""yourId"");    		
isValid = (!rbl.getElementsByTagName(""input"")[0].checked 
    &amp;&amp; !rbl.getElementsByTagName(""input"")[1].checked);

<p>now, one thing i can not seem to work my head around is how to handle nested lists. the dokuwiki syntax uses an asterisk (*) for a list item which is prepended by two white spaces per nesting level (c.f. <a href=""http://www.dokuwiki.org/syntax#lists"" rel=""nofollow"">wiki syntax</a>).</p>

<p><strong>my question:</strong> in the following example, how can the <strong>&lt;xsl:template mach=""li""></strong> that matches the list <strong>item 2.1.1</strong> be aware of it's <strong>nesting level</strong>, in order to prepend the right amount of white spaces?</p>

<pre><code>* list item 1
* list item 2
  * list item 2.1
    * list item 2.1.1
  * list item 2.2
  * list item 2.3
* list item 3
</code></pre>

<p>corresponds to</p>

<ul>
<li>list item 1</li>
<li>list item 2
<ul>
<li>list item 2.1
<ul>
<li>list item 2.1.1</li>
</ul></li>
<li>list item 2.2</li>
<li>list item 2.3</li>
</ul></li>
<li>list item 3</li>
</ul>

<p>which is how the following html is displayed:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        list item 1
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        list item 2
        &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;
                list item 2.1
                &lt;ul&gt;
                    &lt;li&gt;list item 2.1.1&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ul&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;list item 2.2&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;list item 2.3&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;

    	&lt;xsl:param name=""initial-value""/&gt;
    	&lt;xsl:if test=""$initial-value &amp;lt; $maxcount""&gt;

    		&lt;/xsl:call-template&gt;
    	&lt;/xsl:if&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:template&gt;
&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Here is how it breaks down:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;xsl:output method=""text""/&gt;
&lt;xsl:strip-space elements=""*""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You need to make sure that the output of the XSLT is text and you also want to strip any existing whitespace.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;xsl:template match=""//li""&gt;
    ...
&lt;/xsl:template&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This is your main template and will match every single <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> in the document.  The first step in this template is to output the appropriate number of tab characters (feel free to adjust this to be spaces or whatever you need).  The way this is done is by calling a custom <code>loop</code> template that will recursively call itself, looping from <code>initial-value</code> to <code>maxcount</code>, outputting a tab character (<code>&amp;#x9;</code>) on each iteration.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;xsl:text&gt;* &lt;/xsl:text&gt;
&lt;xsl:value-of select=""normalize-space(text())""/&gt;
&lt;xsl:text&gt;&amp;#xd;&lt;/xsl:text&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This chunk simply outputs the text with the <code>*</code> in front and a newline (<code>&amp;#xd;</code>) after.  Note that I used the <code>text()</code> function instead of <code>.</code> to retrieve the value of the node.  If you don't the output of the parent node will (as it should according to the W3C recommendation) concatenate all child text nodes with the parent.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;xsl:apply-templates select=""ul/li"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Finally we recursively call the current template but explicitly reference the next <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> that is a direct child of a <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> - this keeps us from accidentally calling the template twice on the same parent element.</p>

"<p>I am creating a portal where many sites will run of the same MVC application. I have a list of Sites stored in the HttpRuntime.Cache. Is it wrong to access the cache via a static method? Should I instead be passing this on view data?</p>

<p>The first two answers are both correct and complete and at the end of the day, produce exactly the same result.  However, one uses a Regex object and calls the aRegex.Replace(...) method (Joel's answer) and the other uses the static Regex.Replace(...) method. (CMS' answer).</p>

<p>Or is there something I can setup in the OnInit() method where I'm rebinding this data everytime that i can do?</p>

<p>See, my custom EventHander raises an event which is caught by a the parent page in which this control resides, so that the parent could take some action using the newly selected value.  And this is currently working for all cases where the selected index > 0.</p>

<p>I create a property in this control which contains the most recently selected index, in which case my parent page can action on this property value on every Page_Load... dunno.</p>

<p>Open to suggestions.  Or how to force this SelectedIndexChanged event to fire for that 0th index selection.</p>
","34211","Andrew Hare","<p>The problem is that you are loading the data each time and this is resetting the selected index. Imagine this is your dropdown:</p>

<pre><code>zero [selected]
one
two
</code></pre>

<p>Then in the client you change the selected index:</p>

<pre><code>zero
one [selected]
two
</code></pre>

<p>This populates the hidden input <code>__EVENTARGUMENT</code> with your new index (1) and the hidden input <code>__EVENTTARGET</code> with the <code>id</code> of your dropdown.  Now the server-side code kicks in and reloads your data:</p>

<pre><code>zero [selected]
one
two
</code></pre>

<p>""zero"" is the selected value because that is the default when the data is loaded.  Then ASP.NET looks for <code>__EVENTTARGET</code> and <code>__EVENTARGUMENT</code> in the <code>Request</code> and finds your dropdown's <code>id</code> and finds the new index (1).  Now your dropdown looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>zero 
one [selected]
two
</code></pre>

<p>Since the index has changed, the dropdown raises its <code>SelectedIndexChanged</code> event indicating that the index has changed.  Obviously this is the part that is working, now lets see why selecting the first item in the list does not raise the event.</p>

<p>Now lets say that we still have the dropdown in the state it was just in (with ""one"" being selected and the selected index of 1).  What happens when we select the first item in the list on the client?</p>

<p><code>__EVENTTARGET</code> and <code>__EVENTARGUMENT</code> are populated with the <code>id</code> of the dropdown and the new index (0).  Then the server loads the data into the dropdown and the dropdown now looks like this again:</p>

<pre><code>zero [selected]
one
two
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that since you reloaded the data <em>before</em> the events fired the index is already set to 0 because that is the default.  Now when your event fires and the dropdown's selected index is set to 0, the dropdown does not see this as a change since the selected index (as far as it knows) has not changed.</p>

<p>Here is how to fix the problem:</p>

<pre><code>protected override void OnLoad(EventArgs e)
{
    base.OnLoad(e);

    if (!Page.IsPostBack)
    {
    	this.DropDownList1.DataTextField = ""Text"";
    	this.DropDownList1.DataValueField = ""Value"";
    	this.DropDownList1.DataSource = fillQueueDropDown();
    	this.DropDownList1.DataBind();
    }

"<p>I'm hitting a weird issue with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSBuild"" rel=""nofollow"">MSBuild</a>, and I'm thinking it might just be an environment issue. We're using MSBuild to build a number of separate solutions, and it seems to work on my machine. But on a couple of other machines, it's not working.</p>

<p>I've tracked down the issue, and it looks like one of the solutions (or one of the projects in that solution) is being built in ""Release"" when everything else is being built in ""Debug"". This causes some of the references to be missing - so the solution being built in ""Release"" fails to build. I want all solutions to be built in ""Debug"". In the following is our current TFSBuild.proj file - what are we doing wrong?</p>

    &lt;!-- TO EDIT BUILD TYPE DEFINITION

        To edit the build type, you will need to edit
        this file which was generated by the Create New
        Build Type wizard.  This file is under source
        control and needs to be checked out before
        making any changes.

        The file is available at -

            $/{TeamProjectName}/TeamBuildTypes/{BuildTypeName}

        where you will need to replace TeamProjectName
        and BuildTypeName with your Team Project and
        Build Type name that you created

        Checkout the file

          1. Open Source Control Explorer by selecting
             View -&gt; Other Windows -&gt; Source Control Explorer

          2. Ensure that your current workspace has a mapping for
             the $/{TeamProjectName}/TeamBuildTypes folder and
             that you have done a ""Get Latest Version"" on that
             folder

          3. Browse through the folders to
             {TeamProjectName}-&gt;TeamBuildTypes-&gt;{BuildTypeName} folder

          4. From the list of files available in this folder, right
             click on TfsBuild.Proj. Select 'Check Out For Edit...'

        Make the required changes to the file and save

        Checkin the file
          1. Right click on the TfsBuild.Proj file
             selected in Step 3 above and select
             'Checkin Pending Changes'

          2. Use the pending checkin dialog to save your
             changes to the source control

        Once the file is checked in with the
        modifications, all future builds using this
        build type will use the modified settings

"<p>I'm having some issues validating some XML against a Schema, using .net and C#.</p>

<p>I am using XmlReaderSettings with the ValidationEventHandler.</p>

<p>However, this seems to stop catching errors after it has encountered the first error at a particular level within the XML file, instead of checking the next tag at the same level, so basically it does not check each and every tag within the XML file instead skipping a level when it has found an error.</p>

<p>I was hoping to get some advice from somebody who has successfully accomplished this type of validation.</p>

<p>Thanks very much</p>
","34211","Andrew Hare","<p>This sounds like you have a <code>xsd:sequence</code> defined in your schema and the error occurs when the order of elements in your document does not match the order of the elements defined in the schema.</p>

"<p>The title pretty much says it all. When I'm doing some reflection through my classes, will the MemberInfo.GetCustomAttributes() method preserve the order of attributes on a member, or not? The official documentation does not say anything one way or the other.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>In case you're wondering why I would need this, here's the full explanation. It's lengthy and not needed for the question as it is posed now, but perhaps someone can come up with an alternative solution to the greater problem which does not involve relying on attribute enumeration order.</p>

<p>I'm trying to make a flexible framework for an (ASP.NET) application that is expected to have a pretty long lifetime. Over the course it will gain many forms that will have to be accessible from the menu. To make life easier for the developers to come I've made a <code>MenuItemAttribute</code> which you can apply to a form's class. This attribute has an unlimited amount of string parameters in its constructor which allows a developer to specify where exactly will the form reside in the menu. A typical usage example would be something like <code>[MenuItem(""Company"", ""Clients"", ""Orders"")]</code> which would then mean that the menu should have an item ""Company"" under which there would be an item ""Clients"" under which there would be an item ""Orders"" - which would then open the form. A single form can have several of these attributes if needed - it will then be acessible from several places in the menu.</p>

<p>Obviously the whole menu is built in runtime by enumerating through all the classes in my assemblies and searching for this attribute. However recently I've gotten a request that the menu items should be sorted in a predefined way. Forms that have related functionality should be next to each other in the menu. Note that this is NOT alphabetical sorting, but a predefined order that the developers specify.</p>

<p>This then brings the problem - how do I specify the order in these attributes? Since one <code>MenuItemAttribute</code> describes a whole hierarchy, the order specification should also include order numbers for the whole (or at least a part) of the hierarchy. An order number for just the lower level of the hierarchy is not sufficient.</p>

<p>I could make another attribute - <code>MenuItemOrderHintAttribute</code>, but that would then bring problems with cases when there is more than one <code>MenuItemAttribute</code>. Hence the original question.</p>

<p>I could also extend the <code>MenuItemAttribute</code> to take either two arrays or an array of pairs, but that then would complicate the syntax a lot. The last idea is that I could make the strings have special format, but that would be rather messy IMHO.</p>

<p><hr/></p>

<p>OK, I've got another idea. Let's use the ordering that Jon Skeet suggested. This will allow to specify the order for the last level of the hierarchy, not the higher ones. But I could modify the attribute so that it applies not only to classes, but also to the assembly itself. In this case the menu item would not have an associated form. At the assembly level these attributes could then be used to specify the ordering among higher levels of the hierarchy.</p>

<p>This is then a tradeoff between a centralized and decentralized menu system. Any thoughts why this would be a bad idea?</p>
","34211","Andrew Hare","<p>Unfortunately no, you cannot guarantee that the order will be the same as the order in which you specified them.</p>

<h3>Edit: a workaround</h3>

<p>Disclaimer: I apologize ahead of time if I am misunderstanding your ultimate problem.</p>

<p>It sounds as if you need to be able to pass <code>n</code> number of strings to <code>MenuItemAttribute</code> and have <code>MenuItemAttribute</code> maintain the order of these strings as entered by the developer in the attributes constructor.</p>

<p>Here is a possible solution:</p>

<p>Have <code>MenuItemAttribute</code> use a <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/he2s3bh7.aspx"" rel=""nofollow""><code>LinkedList&lt;String&gt;</code></a> to maintain its state.  Then you can iterate the <code>params String[]</code> in your constructor and add them to the <code>LinkedList&lt;String&gt;</code> which would maintain the order.</p>

"<p>Lets assume that I'm dealing with a service that involves sending large amounts of data.</p>

<p>I'm quite curious as to dealing with this problem outside of WCF, I'm still a bit new to service development...</p>
","34211","Andrew Hare","<p>WCF does have a default payload size limit that will reject messages over a certain number of bytes.

"<p>I will be building a set of applications.  One of these apps is unattended application (written in VB6) which will write data it receives from various sources to a local database.  All the other applications (will be written in VS 2008/c# 3.0) will read this data for mostly reporting reasons.</p>

<p>I don't want SQL Server/MySql/Sybase or even its express editions, because distributing it is a problem (e.g. requires separate install, etc...).  I am looking for a local database that has drivers for both VB6 (so probably OLEDB, or ODBC if I have to settle for it) and ADO.NET.  It would also be nice, if the database had support for ORMs, like NHibernate or at least 1-to-1 mappers, like Subsonic, but that's not a deal breaker.  But my main requirement is that the database should be massively solid, so that I don't have to waste time fiddling with it, recovering lost data, etc...</p>

<p>I have experience with MS Access from back in the day and don't have too many good recollections (nor was it bad either).  I've heard of SQLite, SQL Server Compact Edition, VistaDB, etc... but have zero experience with them and I don't know anyone who has actually used it.</p>

"<p>Take a look at these two queries:</p>

SELECT * FROM my_table
WHERE CONTAINS(my_column, 'monkey')

-- #2
SELECT * FROM my_table
WHERE CONTAINS(my_column, 'a OR monkey')  -- ""a"" is a noise word

<p>Query #1 returns 20 rows when I run it in Management Studio.<br />
Query #2 returns the same 20 rows, but I also see the following in the Messages tab:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Informational: The full-text search condition contained noise word(s).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So far, so boring - exactly what I'd expect to happen.</p>

<p>Now, take a look at this C# snippet:</p>

<pre><code>using (SqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection(...))
{
    SqlCommand cmd = conn.CreateCommand();
    // setup the command object...

    conn.Open();
    using (SqlDataReader dr = cmd.ExecuteReader())
    {
        if (dr.HasRows)
        {
            // get column ordinals etc...

            while (dr.Read())
            {
                // do something useful...
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>When I run this code against query #1 everything behaves as expected - the ""do something useful"" section gets hit for each of the 20 rows.</p>

<p>When I run it against query #2, nothing happens - the ""do something useful"" section is never reached.</p>

<p><em>Now here's where things get a bit more interesting...</em></p>

<p>If I remove the <code>HasRows</code> check then everything works as expected - the ""do something useful"" section gets hit for each of the 20 rows, regardless of which query is used.</p>

<p>It seems that the <code>HasRows</code> property isn't populated correctly if SQL Server generates a message. The results are returned and can be iterated through using the <code>Read()</code> method but the <code>HasRows</code> property will be false.</p>

<p>Is this a known bug in .NET and/or SQL Server, or have I missed something obvious?<br />
I'm using VS2008SP1, .NET3.5SP1 and SQL2008.</p>

","34211","Andrew Hare","<p>That certainly is strange behavior - but I am wondering why you need to check <code>HasRows</code> if you are going to simply iterate the result-set.</p>

<p>The <code>HasRows</code> property encapsulates a <code>_hasRows</code> field which gets set in to <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> inside <code>SqlDataReader</code> in many different places for many different reasons.

"<p>I've been going over and over this in my head, and I can't seem to come up with a good reason why C# closures are mutable. It just seems like a good way to get some unintended consequences if you aren't aware of exactly what's happening.</p>

<p>Maybe someone who is a little more knowledgeable can shed some light on why the designers of C# would allow state to change in a closure?</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>var foo = ""hello"";
Action bar = () =&gt; Console.WriteLine(foo);
bar();
foo = ""goodbye"";
bar();
</code></pre>

<p>This will print ""hello"" for the first call, but the outside state changes for the second call, printing ""goodbye."" The closure's state was updated to reflect the changes to the local variable. </p>
","34211","Andrew Hare","<p>When you create a closure, the compiler creates a type for you that has members for each captured variable.  In your example the compiler would generate something like this:</p>

<pre><code>[CompilerGenerated]
private sealed class &lt;&gt;c__DisplayClass1
{
    public string foo;

    public void &lt;Main&gt;b__0()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(this.foo);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Your delegate is given a reference to this type so that it can use the captured variables later.  Unfortunately, the local instance of <code>foo</code> is also changed to point here so any changes locally will affect the delegate as they use the same object.</p>

<p>As you can see the persistence of <code>foo</code> is handled by a public field rather than a property so there is not even an option of immutability here with the current implementation.  I think what you want would have to be something like this:</p>

<pre><code>var foo = ""hello"";
Action bar = [readonly foo]() =&gt; Console.WriteLine(foo);
bar();
foo = ""goodbye"";
bar();
</code></pre>

<p>Pardon the clumsy syntax but the idea is to denote that <code>foo</code> is captured in a <code>readonly</code> fashion which would then hint to the compiler to output this generated type:</p>

<pre><code>[CompilerGenerated]
private sealed class &lt;&gt;c__DisplayClass1
{
    public readonly string foo;

    public &lt;&gt;c__DisplayClass1(string foo)
    {
    	this.foo = foo;
    }

    public void &lt;Main&gt;b__0()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(this.foo);
    }
}

<p>This would give you what you wanted in a certain fashion but would require updates to the compiler.</p>

"<p>I have an ASP.NET 3.5 e-commerce site that has an admin section.  I want to swap out the ASP.NET-based admin section and rewrite it in Silverlight 2.  Silverlight requires async calls, so I can't just call my existing DAL from a new SL2 app.</p>

<p>EDIT:  So what I'm reading is that the best way to do this is to leverage my existing DAL and create a simple WCF service that references that DAL and wraps the calls.  The WCF service does nothing more than act as a middleman to get to my DAL, but expose it to Silverlight.    What if you're starting from scratch?  Should you build out your DAL as a WCF service to begin with and use that service from a WPF client, ASP.NET client, Silverlight client, any other consumer, etc.</p>

  <p>Given a <code>Type</code> object representing this constructed type, the <code>GetGenericTypeDefinition</code> method returns the generic type definition.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><hr /></p>

Edit (the answer above is correct in some cases but wrong in this one):

<p>I think I may have found it now.  The reason that the type comparison is failing is because the <code>Type</code> returned from <code>myType.GetInterfaces()</code> is close to but not identical to the type of the interface itself.</p>

<p>According to <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.type.fullname.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">MSDN</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you use the <code>BaseType</code> property to obtain the base type of <code>Derived</code>, the <code>FullName</code> property of the resulting Type object returns <code>null</code> (Nothing in Visual Basic). To get a non-null <code>FullName</code>, you can use the <code>GetGenericTypeDefinition</code> method to get the generic type definition. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I think this is the problem you are seeing.  Since base interfaces are retrieved via <code>GetInterfaces</code> any type retrieved by that call will not have a <code>FullName</code> (<a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.type.basetype.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">source</a>).  Since it does not have a <code>FullName</code> the types will fail in comparison.</p>

"<p>Our SSO login process uses Forms Authentication against a custom user store in SQL Server.</p>

<p>One of our new security requirements is to only allow an account to have one active session at a time. So any time a user logs in, we will check to see if the login credentials are already active, and preferably prevent the new user from logging in again until the other session ends. Alternatively we could force the other session to end, if that would be easier to implement.</p>

<p>Is there a simple way to do this with Forms Authentication? We've considered a custom approach where we track each session in the database, but it would be a lot of work and we'd probably have to modify all of our applications to detect the session_end, which I'm hoping to avoid. I figure there has to be something in Forms Auth that handles this.</p>

"<p>I'm afraid that this is a very silly question, but I must be missing something.</p>

<p>Why might one want to use <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.string.copy.aspx"">String.Copy(string)</a>?</p>

<p>The documentation says the method</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Creates a new instance of String with
  the same value as a specified String.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since strings are immutable in .NET, I'm not sure what's the benefit of using this method, as I'd think that </p>

</code></pre>

<p>would for all practical purposes seem to yield the same result as</p>

<pre><code> string copy = otherString;
</code></pre>

<p>That is, except for whatever internal bookkeeping that's going on, and the fact that copy is not <code>ReferenceEquals</code> to otherString, there are no observable differences - String being an immutable class whose equality is based on value, not identity.
(Thanks to @<a href=""#520932"">Andrew Hare</a> for pointing out that my original phrasing was not precise enough to indicate that I realized there was a difference between <code>Copy</code>ing and not, but was concerned about the perceived lack of <em>useful</em> difference.)</p>

<p>Of course when passed a <code>null</code> argument, Copy throws an <code>ArgumentNullException</code>, and the ""new instance"" might consume more memory. The latter hardly seems like a benefit, and I'm not sure that the null check is a big enough bonus to warrant a whole Copy method.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> There are a lot of folks that are pretty upset that I did not answer the OP's question.  I believe that I did answer the question by correcting an incorrect premise in the question itself.  Here is an analogous (if not oversimplified) question and answer that will hopefully illustrate my point:</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have observed that my car has two doors, one on each side of the car.  I believe it to be true that regardless of which door I use I will end up sitting in the driver's seat.  What is the purpose of the other door?</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Actually it is not true that if you use either door you will end up in the driver's seat.  If you use the driver's side door you will end up in the driver's seat and if you use the passenger's side door you will end up in the passenger's seat.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now in this example you could argue that the answer is not really an answer as the question was ""what is the purpose of the passenger's side door?"".  But since that question was wholly based on a misconception of the how the doors worked does it not follow that the refutation of the premise will shed new light on the purpose of the other door by deduction?</p>

I am primarily looking for the use of threads in console applications and in ASP.Net apps.</p>

<p>I understand only the very basics of threads and know that ""here be dragons"", so want to get a good grounding in it before I start using them.</p>

<p>Things I am curious about are things like the concept of having a threadpool, how you manage the size of it, how you choose for things to be queued until a thread is available vs forcing a new thread to start etc.
Also, I understand that IIS has lots of built-in thread handling, so anything that explains how to work with threads in ASP.Net under IIS and how it differs from threading in a console C# applicaion is interesting.</p>

<p>My intended usage includes things like;</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The user does something on the ASP.Net page that causes my server-side code to need to connect to another system and carry out lengthy operations, so I want to return control to the user quickly by firing that action to another thread. The user can keep watching progress through AJAX or simply move away - the web is stateless after all :)  </p></li>
<li><p>Use of Fire and Forget patterns (lots of sample code out there, I want to understand more about how they work)</p></li>

"<p>Which is the preferred/recommended way of handling events in .NET:</p>

<pre><code>this.Load += new EventHandler(Form1_Load);
private void Form1_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
{ }
</code></pre>

<p><strong>or</strong></p>

<pre><code>protected override void OnLoad(EventArgs e)
{
    base.OnLoad(e);
}
</code></pre>

<p>What would the pros/cons of each method be? I've used both methods over the years, and have usually leaned more towards the first method simply because that is what Visual Studio creates automatically for handling events. Are there any benefits to the second method that I am missing though?</p>
","34211","Andrew Hare","<p>The overridden method is preferrable as it will be invoked <del>polymorphically</del> virtually by the CLR.</p>

<p>[Edit] Here is why I believe the overridden method is preferable:</p>

<p>Here is a simple example:</p>

<pre><code>class Foo
{
    public event EventHandler Changed = delegate { };

    protected virtual void OnChanged()
    {
    	this.Changed(this, EventArgs.Empty);
    }
}

class Bar : Foo
{
    public Bar()
    {
    	this.Changed += new EventHandler(this.Bar_Changed);
    }

    void Bar_Changed(Object sender, EventArgs e) { }
}

class Baz : Foo
{
    protected override void OnChanged() 
    { 
        base.OnChanged();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now I believe the <code>Baz</code> is the better implementation and here is why.  <code>Bar</code> must do the following IL instructions to wire up the event:</p>

<pre><code>    L_000a: ldftn instance void Bar::Bar_Changed(object, class [mscorlib]System.EventArgs)
    L_0010: newobj instance void [mscorlib]System.EventHandler::.ctor(object, native int)
    L_0015: call instance void Foo::add_Changed(class [mscorlib]System.EventHandler)
</code></pre>

<p>We must create a delegate to the handling method, an instance of the <code>EventHandler</code> and then call the <code>add_Changed</code> method on the event in the base class.  While these are not performance killers none of the previous code is required for <code>Baz</code> to work.  Since any call to <code>OnChanged</code> will be virtual the only performance penalty will be the CLR finding the right instance method to call in the inheritance chain.</p>

"<p>This is my first question so please be patient :)</p>

<p>Background:
I'm implementing an observer pattern and I have about 20 classes where I would eventually implement it. In order to use the subject and observer I need to:
1: initialize observer classes
2: create delegates
3: add delegates to the events</p>

<p>This is probably very simple, but I don't want to initialize all those 3 steps in each class, so I'm leaning toward using the base class to initialize those components. But would that be a good practice? Because the base class would not have anything to do with my other classes, it would just do initialization. Or would it better to just create another class and just create an instance and use those components through that class, but that again I would need to make same instance in 20 classes.</p>

","34211","Andrew Hare","<p>I always see labels as the lazy man's branch.

Besides security concerns (which are much more prevalent then you might think) it is best to let ADO.NET handle the parametrization as you cannot be sure if the value you are passing in requires single quotes around it or not without inspecting the <code>Type</code> of each parameter.</p>

"<p>Imagine I have an interface called IVehicle.</p>

<p>From this interface, I derive several concrete types such as bus and car (all can move, slow down, switch off engine, etc). My interface has no fields.</p>

<p>Would it be bad design to have one class which has fields (e.g. top speed of vehicle) and use this by each of the concrete types? Would this be bad design? Also, if I store state in this class (e.g. use the fields), then would it have to be static?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
","34211","Andrew Hare","<p>I would add <code>TopSpeed</code> to the interface as a property like this:</p>

<pre><code>interface IVehicle
{
    void Move();
    void SlowDown();
    void SwitchOffEngine();

    Int32 TopSpeed { get; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then you implement the interface in your concrete entities like this:</p>

<pre><code>class Car : IVehicle
{
    public void Move() { }
    public void SlowDown() { }
    public void SwitchOffEngine() { }

    public int TopSpeed
    {

}

<p>I think this would be the best approach and doesn't require a base class.  </p>

<p>The reason I believe this is the best approach because <code>TopSpeed</code> is a property that is specific to the implementation and will not have any meaning in a base class.  Since the base class would require that any implementation set this value anyways I think it is best to change the interface to include it.</p>

<li>Customer is changing their mind about the appearance (styling and layout) of the pages</li>
<li>Web designer is non-expert:
<ul>
<li>Isn't developing clean CSS-based layout from scratch</li>
<li>Is taking various table-based layouts (with CSS) from 3rd-party sites, to use as an example/prototype of the layout to discuss with the customer</li>

<li>Then, at the end, after the designer and the customer have agreed on a design, then cut-and-paste the active elements into the designer's prototype pages.</li>

","34211","Andrew Hare","<p>A predicate is a function that returns <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.  A predicate delegate is a reference to a predicate.</p>

<p>So basically a predicate delegate is a reference to a function that returns <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.  Predicates are very useful for filtering a list of values - here is an example. </p>

using System.Collections.Generic;

<p>This means that all of your types in the Acme.Business assembly live in the global namespace which is probably not what you want.

<p>and here's ApplicationGroupCollection:</p>

<pre><code>[Serializable]
public class ApplicationGroupCollection : 
    IList, IEnumerable, IFormattable, ISupportInitialize, 
    IDeserializationCallback, ICloneable, ICustomTypeDescriptor

<p>[Edit] Without testing I cannot tell you if this will do the trick - I am wondering if the DataContractSerializer will be able to serialize your legacy types as the DataContractSerializer requires that types ""opt-in"" with attributes on the type and all members that need serialization.</p>

<p>[Edit] Here is the reason for the second set of errors you are seeing.  If you are returning a custom type from a service then the client needs to have a copy of that type so that it can deserialize the message.  This means that you will need to provide a copy of the assemblies that contain the legacy types to the client for the client to reference.</p>

"<p>I am heavily using byte array to transfer objects, primitive data, over the network and back.

<p>However I am curious as to how much of a performance hit you would incur by using XML instead of a marshaled object.  The reason that I would encourage you to look into XML serialization is because you will be storing the data in an application-neutral format that is also human readable.  If you are able to serialize the data to XML in a way that does not incur performance penalties in your application I would recommend that you look into it.</p>

<p>So my actual question is do I need have Client unsubscribe from StatusType.PropertyChanged event for memory reasons?  If so, should I use a deconstructor, or have client implement IDisposable?</p>

<p>If I was to use a deconstructor, would it look something like this?</p>

<pre><code>~Client()
{
    if (_status != null)
    {
        _status.PropertyChanged -= Status_PropertyChanged;
        _status = null;
    }
}

","34211","Andrew Hare","<p>You could be creating a memory leak if these clients remain in memory indefinitely and their AppDomain is never unloaded.  <code>IDisposable</code> might be a better route as you will have a deterministic approach to cleaning up the handlers you no longer need.</p>

<p>For example common memory issues could be : too much relocation by the garbage collector

<p>There are other posts on memory pressure issues, but the idea here is to be able to quickly point a standard test at a method and the test would red-fail at common/classic memory pressure issues but green-pass the common solutions. A developer may then be pointed to review failing code and possibly fix the leak, change the tolerances or even remove the TDD memory pressure test.</p>

<p>does this idea have legs?</p>

<p>There is a related question here for C++ app, <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/169058/memory-leak-detection-while-running-unit-tests"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/169058/memory-leak-detection-while-running-unit-tests</a>,  which is a similar question but not quite the same thing.  Twk's question is pointing to looking at memory after all the test have run ...</p>

<p>My idea here is for .NET to 
1) unit test each method for common memory issues 
2) fail the classic memory issues 
3) pass the classic fixes to classic common memory issues 
4) be able to quickly throw a quick standard test at a function to see whether it exhibits classic symptoms 
5) be able to upgrade the Standard TDD .Net Memory Pressure Test applied in the unit test.  This implies a refactor of the above code so that upgrades to the standard test will change upgrade the  memory tests applied throughout the Nunit test suite for a project.</p>

<p>(p.s. I know there is no Is.WithinTolerance call but I was just demonstrating an idea. )

","34211","Andrew Hare","<p>Unit tests are generally best employed to test small pieces of functionality.  What you are after sounds a bit more like integration testing which tests the behavior and performance of an entire system.</p>

<p>The problem that I see with this approach is that any given unit in your system may not generate these memory-related errors.  So even if you could get something like this to work you could not guarantee that memory issues would not arise once your units were working as a whole.</p>

<p>So my advice would be to do integration testing in multiple states.  Test the system under different levels of load and see what kind of memory issues (if any) arise.  This kind of testing will be much more beneficial to you.</p>

"<p>I'm trying to get an understanding of what the the java keyword <code>this</code> actually does.
I've been reading Sun's documentation but I'm still fuzzy on what <code>this</code> actually does.</p>
","34211","Andrew Hare","<p>The <code>this</code> keyword is a reference to the current object.</p>

<pre><code>class Foo

<p>Another way to think about it is that the <code>this</code> keyword is like a personal pronoun that you use to reference yourself.  Other languages have different words for the same concept.  VB uses <code>Me</code> and the Python convention (as Python does not use a keyword, simply an implicit parameter to each method) is to use <code>self</code>.</p>

"<p>A question I have been thinking about for a while - would Stackoverflow users commonly implement significant functionality in a constructor (specifically in classes derived from the System.Web.UI.Page class) , or should we keep the logic here as simple as possible and instead implement functionality in OnPreInit (using the constructor to simply instantiate objects/values that are required for the functionality in the rest of the page to function)? Is there a ""best-practice"" approach to this scenario?</p>

<p>The background to this question:</p>

<p>The system that I am working on has a fairly deep page hierarchy  - there are about 10 chained page objects that the actual page derives from:</p>

<pre>

-- System.Web.UI.Page 
----- CustomPage1 : System.Web.UI.Page 
-------- CustomPage2 : CustomPage1
---------- etc

</pre>

<p>Each page adds a specific piece of functionality, and often there is either a dependancy on code run within the custom page constructor, or the functionality itself is directly run during construction.</p>

<p>The example that best illustrates my question is the page that loads custom objects from our database to the page so they are available during the page lifecycle - during page construction connections are made to the database and then public properties are populated with the correct values. </p>

<p>To my mind this is better done from the OnPreInit event, mainly because we have greater flexibility to perform some page level checks (e.g. should we want to prevent this functionality being called) before the parent logic is run (given that in a constructor the order of execution will construct the parent classes before the child class). From an OO perspective as well OnPreInit seems to be a more appropriate area to implement this functionality - page construction should deal with construction of the page, setting any default values, etc and then OnPreInit would be used to perform any functionality that was required during the lifecycle of the page.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here are some rules of thumb for deciding when to refactor:  </p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Even if code is ugly, if you don't have to change it, don't fix it.  You just risk breaking things.</li>
  <li>If you are adding some functionality and it is hard to implement, refactor.</li>
  <li>If you have to change the same code a second time, assume you'll probably be back a 3rd and 4th time and refactor.</li>
  <li>If you don't have unit tests, think long and hard before refactoring.  Without tests, you can't know you didn't break anything.  Write unit tests first if necessary.</li>

"<p>I'm doing a raytracer hobby project, and originally I was using structs for my Vector and Ray objects, and I thought a raytracer was the perfect situation to use them: you create millions of them, they don't live longer than a single method, they're lightweight. However, by simply changing 'struct' to 'class' on Vector and Ray, I got a very significant performance gain. </p>

<p>What gives? They're both small (3 floats for Vector, 2 Vectors for a Ray), don't get copied around excessively. I do pass them to methods when needed of course, but that's inevitable. So what are the common pitfalls that kill performance when using structs? I've read <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms973839.aspx"">this</a> MSDN article that says the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When you run this example, you'll see that the struct loop is orders of magnitude faster. However, it is important to beware of using ValueTypes when you treat them like objects. This adds extra boxing and unboxing overhead to your program, and can end up costing you more than it would if you had stuck with objects! To see this in action, modify the code above to use an array of foos and bars. You'll find that the performance is more or less equal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's however quite old (2001) and the whole ""putting them in an array causes boxing/unboxing"" struck me as odd. Is that true? However, I did pre-calculate the primary rays and put them in an array, so I took up on this article and calculated the primary ray when I needed it and never added them to an array, but it didn't change anything: with classes, it was still 1.5x faster. </p>

<p>I am running .NET 3.5 SP1 which I believe fixed an issue where struct methods weren't ever in-lined, so that can't be it either.</p>

<p>So basically: any tips, things to consider and what to avoid?</p>

"<p>I've recently seen some information about avoiding coding to specific browsers an instead using feature/bug detection.  It seems that John Resig, the creator of jQuery is a big fan of feature/bug detection (he has an excellent talk that includes a discussion of this on <a href=""http://video.yahoo.com/watch/4403981/11812238"" rel=""nofollow"">YUI Theater</a>).  I'm curious if people are finding that this approach makes sense in practice?  What if the bug no longer exists in the current version of the browser (It's an IE6 problem but not 7 or 8)?</p>
","34211","Andrew Hare","<p>Object detection's greatest strength is that you only use the objects and features that are available to you by the client's browser.  In other words given the following code:</p>

<pre><code>if (document.getFoo) {
    // always put getFoo in here
} else {
    // browsers who don't support getFoo go here
}
</code></pre>

<p>allows you to cleanly separate out the browsers without naming names.  The reason this is cool is because as long as a browser supports <code>getFoo</code> you don't have to worry which one it is.  This means that you may actually support browsers you have never heard of.  If you target user agent strings find the browser then you only can support the browsers you know.</p>

"<p>So I am stuck with fixing/maintaining another programmers code (blech)</p>

<p>I am a firm professor of the rule <strong>""If it ain't broke dont fix it!""</strong> so depsite wanting to change something every time I come across horrendous code, I am keeping myself limited to only changing the absolute minimum amount of code possible to make the required fixes.  But in some cases I really need to understand something before trying to follow it/change it.</p>

<p>I came across this little bit here:</p>

<pre><code>region.LineSelected = (x) =&gt; { };
</code></pre>

<p>And am wondering if it's the same as this:</p>

<pre><code>region.LineSelected = null;

<p>I want to be 100% positive of what the first line is doing before I go changing the method it's in.</p>
","34211","Andrew Hare","<p>No it is not the same thing - the first line assigns <code>LineSelected</code> an empty delegate which is very different from <code>null</code>.</p>

<p>The easiest way to spot the difference is to look at the code that compiler generates on your behalf when you use the lambda syntax.  This code:</p>

<pre><code>using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
    	Action&lt;int&gt; func0 = (x) =&gt; { };
    	Action&lt;int&gt; func1 = null;
    }

<pre><code>internal class Program
{
    // Methods
    private static void Main()
    {
        Action&lt;int&gt; func0 = delegate (int x) {
        };
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that the compiler was smart enough to remove <code>func1</code> as it was set to <code>null</code> and not referenced elsewhere.  But notice that <code>func0</code> still remains and is set to a delegate that albeit does nothing but is very different from <code>null</code>.</p>

"<p>We have an ASP.NET website in production that generates a report and sends it to the user's browser as a PDF file. Our error reporting is showing that we are getting a lot of this exception: </p>

<p>System.Web.HttpException: The remote host closed the connection. The error code is 0x80072746.</p>

<p>These appear to be caused by the user closing their browser before the report generation is complete. I've added code to deal with this error, but I can't find a way to test it. The ASP.NET development server that runs when you test in Visual Studio doesn't allow remote connections so I can't go to another machine and try it. And closing the browser when running the website on my machine doesn't produce the exception (presumably because I'm not a ""remote host""). </p>

<p>I have a content editor that users will be able to edit web pages.  They can format text, add links, etc.. standard content editor stuff.  When they click save, the editor provides the ability to get the content (editor.Content) and put it into a string.  What I want to do is get any links (<code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tags) and find out if they are internal or external links and if they are PDF files.  </p>

For Each m as Match in matchColl
   If m.Groups(""domain"").value &lt;&gt; myInternalDomain and m.Groups(""domain"").value &lt;&gt; """" then
       'this is an external domain... do some stuff

   If m.Groups(""path"").value.EndsWith("".pdf"") then
         'it is a pdf, do some other stuff...
   End if
Next

</blockquote>



<p>I'm writing a jQuery plugin that handles a bunch of image animations with a simple call to the plugin function (something like <code>$(""#image1"").anims()</code> where <code>#image1</code> is an image), however as part of the plugin's functionality I use <code>$(this).width()</code> to get the width of the image right at the start of the function call. </p>

<p>But, since the plugin function is called in <code>$(document).ready</code>, it's trying to get the width of the image before the image has loaded, so it's always returning 0. Is there a workaround for this?</p>
","34211","Andrew Hare","<p>You could use a <a href=""http://www.w3schools.com/js/js%5Ftiming.asp"" rel=""nofollow""><code>setTimeout()</code></a> function to delay the execution long enough for the image to load.</p>

<p>Here is an example of how it works:</p>

<pre><code>setTimeout(""alert('hello world');"", 5000);
</code></pre>

<p>The first argument is a string that your javascript engine will parse as executing code and the second argument is an integer value that represents how many milliseconds you wish to delay before the code in your first argument executes.</p>

<p>However there is no equivalent in Java.  Is there any reason Java has not included something similar?</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

Is there any compelling argument against adding this syntax to Java?  Some negative to it, that I'm just not seeing?</p>
","34211","Andrew Hare","<p>Java has always struck me as a minimalist language - I would imagine that since verbatim strings are not a necessity (like properties for instance) they were not included.</p>

<p>For instance in C# there are many quick ways to do thing like properties:</p>

<pre><code>public int Foo { get; set; }
</code></pre>

<p>and verbatim strings:</p>

<pre><code>String bar = @""some
string"";
</code></pre>

<p>Java tends to avoid as much syntax-sugar as possible.   If you want getters and setters for a field you must do this:</p>

<pre><code>private int foo;

public int getFoo() { return this.foo; }
public int setFoo(int foo) { this.foo = foo; }

<p>and strings must be escaped:</p>

<p>I think it is because in a lot of ways C# and Java have different design goals.  C# is rapidly developed with many features being constantly added but most of which tend to be syntax sugar.  Java on the other hand is about simplicity and ease of understanding.  A lot of the reasons that Java was created in the first place were reactions against C++'s complexity of syntax.</p>

"<p>I would like to know what copy-on-write is and what it is used for? The term 'copy-on-write array' is mentioned several times in the Sun JDK tutorials but I didn't understand what it meant.</p>
","34211","Andrew Hare","<p>I was going to write up my own explanation but <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write"">this Wikipedia article</a> pretty much sums it up.</p>

<p><strong>Here is the basic concept:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Copy-on-write (sometimes referred to as ""COW"") is an optimization strategy used in computer programming. The fundamental idea is that if multiple callers ask for resources which are initially indistinguishable, you can give them pointers to the same resource. This function can be maintained until a caller tries to modify its ""copy"" of the resource, at which point a true private copy is created to prevent the changes becoming visible to everyone else. All of this happens transparently to the callers. The primary advantage is that if a caller never makes any modifications, no private copy need ever be created.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Also here is an application of a common use of COW:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The COW concept is also used in maintenance of instant snapshot on database servers like Microsoft SQL Server 2005. Instant snapshots preserve a static view of a database by storing a pre-modification copy of data when underlaying data are updated. Instant snapshots are used for testing uses or moment-dependent reports and should not be used to replace backups.</p>

"<p>What is the overhead of generating a lot of temporary objects (i.e. for interim results) that ""die young"" (never promoted to the next generation during a garbage collection interval)?

","34211","Andrew Hare","<p>If these objects are never promoted out of Generation 0 then you will see pretty good performance.  The only hidden cost I can see is that if you exceed your Generation 0 budget you will force the GC to compact the heap but the GC will self-tune so this isn't much of a concern.</p>

"<p>I have a module that I want to keep up to date, and I'm wondering if this is a bad idea: </p>

  different module from some other
  location into the site-packages
  directory, and then imports * from
  that module.</p>

p_local = get_python_lib() + r'\mod1_current.py'

<p>Here is the current process... there is a project under source-control that has a single module: <code>mod1.py</code>  There is also a <code>setup.py</code>  Running <code>setup.py</code> copies <code>mod1.py</code> to the site-packages directory.  </p>

<p>Developers that use the module must run <code>setup.py</code> to update the module. Sometimes, they don't and not having the latest version causes problems.</p>

"<p>Are staging tables an anti-pattern that is used when rpc (such as Java RMI or some kind of Web Service call) or messaging queue (such as JMS) would be a better solution, or are there problems better served by staging tables?</p>

<p>To clarify:</p>

<p>By staging tables I mean those cases where records are appended to a table or tables by a process which is then read by and acted on by second process or processes. I am not referring to tables which tables which are meant to reflect end of interval status (end of day, end of pay period etc). In most cases, the schema of the staging tables closely mimics an application data type(s) such as customer or account. </p>

<p>Potential causes for this anti-pattern:</p>

<p>1) Business Unit Wall between owners of the two processes prevents process that writes to or reads from staging being modified. </p>

<p>2) Low confidence in process that writes to or reads from staging leads developers to use table to prevent data loss ""in case something fails""</p>

<p>3) Lack of knowledge or DGAS (don't give a ^%$@) attitude</p>
","34211","Andrew Hare","<p>Why would they be an anti-pattern?  Staging tables are incredibly useful for decoupling a receiving service from a processing service.  When two such services are decoupled you are much more resilient to processing errors and network errors as all messages are stored in the staging table.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In computer programming, unit testing is a software design and development method where the programmer gains confidence that individual units of source code are fit for use. A unit is the smallest testable part of an application. In procedural programming a unit may be an individual program, function, procedure, etc., while in object-oriented programming, the smallest unit is a method, which may belong to a base/super class, abstract class or derived/child class.</p>
  
  <p>Unit testing can be done by something as simple as stepping through code in a debugger; modern applications include the use of a test framework such as xUnit.</p>
  
  <p>Ideally, each test case is independent from the others; Double objects like stubs, mock or fake objects[1] as well as test harnesses can be used to assist testing a module in isolation. Unit testing is typically done by software developers to ensure that the code other developers have written meets software requirements and behaves as the developer intended.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The primary goal of unit testing is to take the smallest piece of testable software in the application, isolate it from the remainder of the code, and determine whether it behaves exactly as you expect. Each unit is tested separately before integrating them into modules to test the interfaces between modules. Unit testing has proven its value in that a large percentage of defects are identified during its use.</p>

  <p>Unit tests enable collective code ownership. When you create unit tests you guard your functionality from being accidentally harmed. Requiring all code to pass all unit tests before it can be released ensures all functionality always works. Code ownership is not required if all classes are guarded by unit tests.</p>

XHTML. It can, depending on a parameter, produces a full XHTML

<p>Could someone explain this behavior to me?
Thx in advance.</p>
","34211","Andrew Hare","<p>Yes closures are working here.  Each time you loop the function you are creating grabs the <code>i</code>.  Each function you create shares the same <code>i</code>.  The problem you are seeing is that since they all share the same <code>i</code> they also share the final value of <code>i</code> since it is the same captured variable.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> <a href=""http://csharpindepth.com/Articles/Chapter5/Closures.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">This article</a> by Mr. Skeet explains closures in some depth and addresses this issue in particular in a way that is much more informative then I have here.  <strong><em>However be careful as the way that Javascript and C# handle closures have some subtle differences.</em></strong>  Skip to the section called ""Comparing capture strategies: complexity vs power"" for his explanation on this issue.</p>

"<p>I have a decent sized set of data that needs to be stored in an active record. In order to prepopulate the form fields on the page, I have already written the following code:</p>

<pre><code>Device device = new Device(DeviceID); // device is simply the active record

txtDeviceName.Text = device.Name;
txtNotes.Text = device.Notes;
txtHostName.Text = device.Hostname;
txtAssetTag.Text = device.AssetTag;
txtSerialNumber.Text = device.SerialNumber;
// snip... the list goes on!
</code></pre>

<p>Is there some sort of the method (built-in functionality, macro, etc.) that I could use to swap each side of the expression such that the data is saved into the active record as opposed to read from it in order to perform a database insert? For example, after highlighting the above code and running the macro, it would become:</p>

<pre><code>device.DeviceName = txtDeviceName.Text;
device.Notes = txtNotes.Text;
device.Hostname = txtHostName.Text;
device.AssetTag = txtAssetTag.Text;
device.SerialNumber = txtSerialNumber.Text;
// snip again...
</code></pre>

<p>Since the number of columns in the database that this active record encapsulates is rather large, it seems like most of this typing could be avoided with a simple automated process.</p>

<p>Obviously this wouldn't work 100% because sometimes there would have to be type conversions (e.g. <code>int</code> to <code>string</code>) but for the most part I think this would save a lot of time.</p>
","34211","Andrew Hare","<p>Here is a macro that will do it:</p>

"<p>Hi I use Sessions in my application and I was wondering what is the best practice for maintaining session value on a page.  I need the value that is stored in the session to be saved until the post back on a particular page.  Let me illustrate:</p>

<pre><code>Page A:                             Page B:
Sets Session[""ID""] = 5       --&gt;    Gets Session[""ID""]
And redirects to Page B             and populates data.

<p>I need the <code>Session[""ID""]</code> on Page B to stay alive until a post back is performed on Page B.  I need this because I will be using the value of <code>Session[""ID""]</code> update data in the database.  </p>

<p>My question is:  Is the any guarantee that the <code>Session[""ID""]</code> will maintain its value until a post back is performed?  Won't it die?  If so: What are some methods I can take to make sure it maintains its value?</p>

<p>I was thinking of making a private variable in Page B to store the <code>Session[""ID""]</code> on Page_Load. Please let me know what you think, thank you.</p>

<p>I'm sorry, I should have said: I cannot allow the user to modify the <code>ID</code>. So no <code>Query Strings</code>, thanks.</p>
","34211","Andrew Hare","<p>Session is stored in memory on the server by default.  This can be problematic if the user's session times out.  Also if you are using more than one server as a farm you cannot use Session in memory as you cannot guarantee that the user will use the same server each time.</p>

<p>The best way to guarantee that session information will not be lost is to persist a user's session to a SqlServer database. <a href=""http://faqfront.com/document/sql-server-session-state"" rel=""nofollow"">Here is a tutorial on how to set that up.</a></p>

"<p>Need: Find a way to add a valid tag/attribute/property to a normal html control.</p>

<p>What I have is some javascript/jquery adding a click event to a link that will show or hide a div.  The idea is to do this using $(document).ready and an anonymous method to create the method called by onClick at the page load.  When clicked, a div will be shown with some text.  This is all well and good except I can't figure out how to set up the text so that this can be done on the page load.  What I'd like is something like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href=""..."" class=""showItLink"" textToShow=""This is the text to show""&gt;HI&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>so that I can do this:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready
(
  function()
  {
    $(""..showItLink"").click
    (
      function(event) 
      {
        var containerPosition;
        var createdDiv;

        //see if the div already exists
        createdDiv = $(this).children("".postComment"");

        if (createdDiv.length == 0) 
        {
          //This is where the attribute is used so that the CreateDiv
          //method can take the textToShow and fill the div's innerText
          //with it                  V V V V V V
          createdDiv = CreateDiv(this.textToShow, ""postComment""); 
          $(this).append(createdDiv);

"<p>We are experiencing random intermittent slow-downs in our ASP.NET application. Most pages take between 100-500ms to render (depending on which modules are used on the page). Occasionally however - perhaps 1 in 100 requests, these figures are more like 5000-10000ms. This is not a database related issue - I have checked for slow queries, and is not related to the complexity of the page - e.g. a page which takes 100ms is just as likely to take 10000ms when it slows down.

It is about C# specifically but the OOP theory is universal and solid.</p>

<p>Here is an excerpt:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the reason that motivated the
  change from automatically implemented
  property to explicitly implemented
  property was to change the semantics
  of the property then you should
  evaluate whether the desired semantics
  when accessing the property from
  within the class are identical to or
  different from the desired semantics
  when accessing the property from
  outside the class.</p>
  
  <p>If the result of that investigation is
  “from within the class, the desired
  semantics of accessing this property
  are different from the desired
  semantics of accessing the property
  from the outside”, then your edit has
  introduced a bug. You should fix the
  bug. If they are the same, then your
  edit has not introduced a bug; keep
  the implementation the same.</p>

<p>My objective right now is to find out when pages take too long to load, to focus attention in those spots.</p>

<p>I'm thinking on hooking the PreRequestHandlerExecute and PostRequestHandlerExecute events in Global.asax, and create a StopWatch in ""Pre"", attach it to HttpContext.Items, and read it in ""Post"", and if the request took more than, say, 100ms, it'll report to me to let me know.</p>

<p>Some ""pseudo code"" for that would be:</p>

<pre><code>protected void Application_PreRequestHandlerExecute(Object sender, EventArgs e) {
    System.Diagnostics.Stopwatch theTimer = new Stopwatch();
    theTimer.Start();
    HttpContext.Current.Items.Add(""RequestTimer"", theTimer);
}

     Stopwatch theTimer = (Stopwatch) HttpContext.Current.Items[""RequestTimer""];

Is it reasonable to do this?<br />
Is it going to make my website crawl to its knees?<br />

  - It may be better to grab DateTime.Now.Ticks and store that, which is probably going to be lighter than the StopWatch<br />
  - I know it'd be better to have all pages inherit from a page of my own, and time there, but I don't want to go through dozens of pages and change them all.</p>

"<p>If I create an abstract property in my C# Base class, and then a subclass implements it, is it possible to then reference and use that property in one of my Base class's methods later on once the subclass sets that property?  </p>

<p>I want to sort of pass a value from my subclass to base class so that in my base class I can perform some logic using it in that Base class method.</p>

<p>Or even not a property but an field instead...same idea...but I would need to require that field to be set in a subclass if the case..don't think that's even possible?  I don't really need a property if I can set some sort of flag in my subclass via an abstract field so that the base class can use that flag for some logic that my subclass is going to depend on such as sending an HttpRequest. </p>

<p>Basically I want to be able to set a flag in any subclasses using this base to say true or false so that the Base class's SendRequest method knows whether to chose from a couple of URIs that I have set in my base class.  That flag will determine which format to use in the base class's SendRequest method since each subclass will vary in terms of what URI format the base class should use for that subclass in order to send the HttpRequest on behalf of the subclass.</p>

<p>I think you may be misunderstanding how events are wired up in .NET.  When you do this:</p>

<p>You are not calling the method <code>Click</code>, you are passing a delegate to a compiler-generated method for the <code>Button.Click</code> event that adds your delegate to a delegate invocation list.  When the <code>Button</code> raises its <code>Click</code> event your delegate is invoked by the <code>Button</code>.  </p>

<p>Since you will not be the one to invoke the method via the delegate you cannot change what gets passed in.  Your best option is to use the <code>Object</code> that is passed to you and cast it to a <code>Button</code> like I did above.</p>

<p>Since classes pass a copy of their reference to methods they incur much less overhead when used as method arguments.</p>

I wonder if after all this years there's a new language or IDE that helps programming in an easier and faster way than VB6.
I'm not very interested in academic/personal issues like, very high performance, great movility through OSs, open source, etc. I would like to know if there's is something to program small and medium desktop apps. in an very easy and fast way.</p>

<p>Excuse me if my english isn't very clear.</p>

<p>Edit answering Nicholas:
Well, I must admit that I didn't try VB.Net too much, I was a little disappointed because I would had to learn a lot of new things and I've had learned VB6 not so long before (in that moment).</p>

"<p>With the increasing popularity of powerful client side javascript widgets, I am curious on when is the best time to handle the sorting of data strictly on the client side, making use of widgets such as those found in YUI, and when to make a request to the backend and have it handle the sorting via a DB query or other means.  </p>

"<p>I tend to use the words define, declare and assign interchangeably but this seems to cause offense to some people. Is this justified? Should I only use the word declare for the first time I assign to a variable? Or is there more to it than that?</p>
","34211","Andrew Hare","<p>Define and declare are similar but assign is very different.</p>

"<p>I know others have asked about using class and id in CSS files, such as</p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/84378/div-class-vs-id"">Div: Class vs Id</a></p>

<p>So I'm aware of the semantic and syntactic differences between class and id: that id should be used for elements that are used only once and class should be used for elements that share attributes in common. </p>

<p>But this isn't a hard-and-fast rule, is it? What's the harm in using an id for more than one element? Or using a class for only one? After all, isn't ""one element"" just a set (class) with only one thing in it?</p>

<p>The real answer is that there is a semantic difference between an identifier for one and only one object and an identifier that can apply to multiple objects.  While you can break the rules it is best not to.</p>

In order to encourage developers to use properties (as they are a best-practice for many reasons) Microsoft decided to include this feature in C# 3 to allow you to declare properties with greater ease.</p>

<p>Here is the standard way of creating a property:</p>

<pre><code>String foo;

public String Foo
{
    get { return this.foo }
    set { this.foo = value; }
}

<p>Now this requires quite a bit of typing and as developers are lazy to the core sometimes we are tempted to create public fields just to save some time.</p>

<p>Now with the C# 3 compiler we can do this:</p>

<pre><code>public String Foo { get; set; }
</code></pre>

<p>While this looks a bit strange, consider the work that the compiler is doing on your behalf.  The previous code gets compiled to this:</p>

<p>I wonder what the purpose of delegates is. I haven't used them that much and can't really think of something.</p>

<p>In my courses, it's written that a delegate is a blue-print for all methods that comply with its signature.</p>

<p>Also, you can add multiple methods to one delegate, and then they'll be executed after eachother in the order they were added. Which is probably only usefull for methods that affect local variables or methodes that don't return any values.</p>

<p>I've read that C# implements Events as delegates, which is documented as being:</p>

<pre><code>//Summary: Represents the method that
will handle an event that has no event
data.

//Parameters:

//sender: The source of the event.

//e: An System.EventArgs that contains no event data.

[Serializable]

[ComVisible(true)]

  Home Details on RBAC concept can be
  found at NIST RBAC</p>
  
  <p>While the design approach given in
  Strembeck's work was comprehensive
  enough to be realized on .Net, the
  default implementation (done on XoTcl)
  used extensive patterns from the
  language (e.g. ability to use an
  object as a class!), so a quick port
  of that to a complete .Net
  implementation of the design would
  have taken a bit of an effort in my
  current project. Well, instead of then
  implementing the solution, I selected
  MS Authorization Manager (I know folks
  will say, Dah... that would have been
  a no brainer). This is a small library
  and a management console prrovided on
  Windows 2003 and 2000 that implements

"<p>There is a package I have to deal with which installs assemblies straight into the GAC (e.g. somewhere deep in %windows%/assembly).  </p>

<p>How do I exorcise the actual assembly (the DLL) from the GAC into the normal file system?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
","34211","Andrew Hare","<p>I used the advice from <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/akukreja/archive/2008/05/23/get-dll-out-of-the-gac.aspx"">this article</a> to get an assembly from the GAC.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Get DLL Out of The GAC</strong>  </p>
  
  <p>DLLs once
  deployed in GAC (normally located at
  c:\windows\assembly) can’t be viewed
  or used as a normal DLL file. They
  can’t be directly referenced from VS
  project. Developers usually keep a
  copy of the original DLL file and
  refer to it in the project at
  development (design) time, which uses
  the assembly from GAC during run-time
  of the project.</p>
  
  <p>During execution (run-time) if the
  assembly is found to be signed and
  deployed in GAC the CLR automatically
  picks up the assembly from the GAC
  instead of the DLL referenced during
  design time in VS. In case the
  developer has deleted the original DLL
  or don't have it for some reason,
  there is a way to get the DLL file
  from GAC. Follow the following steps
  to copy DLL from GAC</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li><p>Run regsvr32 /u C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\shfusion.dll</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>shfusion.dll is an explorer extension DLL that gives a distinct
  look to the GAC folder. Unregistering
  this file will remove the assembly
  cache viewer and the GAC folder will
  be then visible as any normal folder
  in explorer. </li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><p>Open “%windir%\assembly\GAC_MSIL”.</p></li>
  <li><p>Browse to your DLL folder into the deep to find your DLL.</p></li>
  <li><p>Copy the DLL somewhere on your hard disk and refer it from there in your
  project</p></li>
  <li><p>Run ""regsvr32 %windir%\Microsoft.NET\Framework\&lt;.NET
  version directory> \shfusion.dll"" to
  re-register the shfusion.dll file and
  regain the original distinct view of
  the GAC.</p></li>

","34211","","<p>You can do this but your primary key would cease to be a primary key and you data would be denormalized.  The best way to do this would be to split this table into two separate tables like this:</p>

----------
VisitSerialId
Examination
Pland

"<p>I have an ASP.NET 3.5 Website (visual studio lingo), but the site continues to grow and is looking rather cowboyish among other things.  I'd like to see this get converted into a Web Application (namespaces and all).</p>

<p>Is this something that can be easily done in Visual Studio?  If not, are there any other tools out there that could create all of the namespaces, etc. automagically?</p>
","34211","","<p><a href=""http://weblogs.asp.net/meligy/archive/2008/08/03/converting-vs-2008-website-to-web-application.aspx"">Here is a good walkthrough:</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>Well, it turns out that the option ""Convert to web application"" does NOT exist for ""websites"". The option ""Convert to web application"" does exist only for ""web applications"" !!!!</em></strong> </p>
  
  <p><em>[emphasis mine]</em></p>
  
  <p>So, here's the deal, to do the
  conversion, you need to:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><p>Add a new ""Web Application"" to your VS 2008 solution (File->Add->New
  Project->C#->Web->ASP.NET Web
  Application).</p></li>
  <li><p>Afterwards, you copy all the files in the old ""website"" to your newly
  created ""web application"", and
  override any files created in it by
  default</p></li>
  <li><p>The next step is the most ugly, you need to ""manually"" add the references
  in your ""website"" to the new ""web
  application"". I thought the VS 2008
  PowerCommands toy would do this for me
  as it does copy references from other
  project types, but it didn't. You have
  to do it by yourself, manually, and
  you have to be cautious in this step
  if you have multiple versions of the
  same assembly (like AJAXToolkit in my
  case) or assemblies that have both GAC
  and local versions or so.</p></li>
  <li><p>Keep repeating the last step and trying to build the ""web application"".
  You'll keep getting errors like ""
  '....' is unknown namespace. Are you
  missing an assembly reference? "". Make
  sure you have none of those except the
  ones where '....' is replaced by the
  IDs of the server controls you use. In
  other words, keep adding references
  and building the project until only
  the errors that exist because of
  missing .DESIGNER.CS or .DESIGNER.VB
  files.</p></li>
  <li><p>Afterwards, go to the ""web application"" root project node in VS
  2008 solution explorer, and right
  click it, then you WILL find the
  option ""Convert to web application"".
  What this option does is actually
  making small changes to the ""@Page""
  and ""@Control"" directives of pages and
  controls, and creating the required
  .DESIGNER.CS or .DESIGNER.VB files.</p></li>
  <li><p>Try building the ""web application"" again. If you get errors, see what
  references may be missing and/or go
  click the ""Convert to web application""
  again. Sometimes, if there's any error
  other than those caused of missing
  DESIGNER files, not all the
  pages/controls will have those
  DESIGNER files created for them.
  Fixing the non DESIGNER problem and
  clicking ""Convert to web application""
  again should do the job for this.</p></li>
  <li><p>Once you are done successful VS build, you should be ready to go.
  Start testing your web application.
  Optionally, you can right click the
  ""web application"" root project node in
  VS 2008 Solution Explorer and click
  ""Properties"" then go to the tab ""Web""
  to set the ""web application"" to a
  virtual folder in IIS (you can create
  new virtual directory from there in
  VS). If you want to use the IIS
  virtual directory that the old
  ""website"" used, you need to remove
  that from IIS first.</p></li>
  <li><p>Update: When testing your pages, pay MOST ATTENTION to classes in
  ""App_Code"" folder, especially those
  with NO NAMESPACE. Those can be a big
  trap. We had a problem with two
  extension method overloads in the same
  static class that had no namespace,one
  extends DateTime? (Nullable)
  and calls another overload that
  extends DateTime itself. Calling the
  other overload as extension method
  passed VS 2008 compilation and gave us
  a compilation error ONLY IN RUNTIME
  (With IIS). Changing the call to the
  other overload from calling it as
  extension method to calling it as
  normal static method (only changing
  the call in the same class, calls from
  other classes remained extension
  method calls) did solve this one, but
  clearly, it's not as safe as it used
  to be in VS 2005. Especially with
  classes with no namespaces.</p></li>
  <li><p>Update2: During the conversion, VS 2008 renames your ""App_Code"" to
  ""Old_App_Code"". This new name sounds
  ugly, but DO NOT RENAME IT BACK. In
  the ""web application"" model, all code
  will be in one assembly. In runtime,
  the web server does not know what web
  project type you are using. It does
  take all code in ""App_Code"" folder and
  create a new assembly for it. This
  way, if you have code in folder named
  ""App_Code"", you'll end up with RUNTIME
  compilation errors that the same types
  exist in two assemblies, the one
  created by VS, and the one created by
  IIS / ASP.NET Development Server. To
  avoid that. leave the ""Old_App_Code""
  with the same name, or rename it to
  ANYTHING EXCEPT: ""App_Code"". Do not
  place any code in such ""App_Code""
  folder and prefereably do NOT have a
  folder with such name in your ""web
  application"" at all.</p></li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>I know this since before but forgot it
  now as I have not used ""website"" model
  for long :(.</p>

<p><strong>What is a fault clause?</strong>  </p>

<p>See quote from article below:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An error condition can only pass from
  the function containing the unexpected
  condition to that function's caller.
  Exceptions have the power to pass the
  results of a function's execution out
  of the current function's scope to
  every frame up the stack until it
  reaches the frame that knows how to
  handle the unexpected condition. The
  CLR's exception system (called a
  two-pass exception system) delivers
  the exception to every predecessor on
  the thread's call stack, beginning
  with the caller and proceeding until
  some function says it will handle the
  exception (this is known as the first
  pass).</p>
  
  <p>The exception system will then unwind
  the state of each frame on the call
  stack between where the exception is
  raised and where it will be handled
  (known as the second pass). As the

","34211","","<p>There are several ways to do this.  You can use <code>ref</code> parameters:</p>

<pre><code>int Foo(ref Bar bar) { }

<p>This passes a reference to the function thereby allowing the function to modify the object in the calling code's stack.  While this is not technically a ""returned"" value it is a way to have a function do something similar.  In the code above the function would return an <code>int</code> and (potentially) modify <code>bar</code>.</p>

<p>Another similar approach is to use an <code>out</code> parameter.  An <code>out</code> parameter is identical to a <code>ref</code> parameter with an additional, compiler enforced rule.  This rule is that if you pass an <code>out</code> parameter into a function, that function is required to set its value prior to returning.  Besides that rule, an <code>out</code> parameter works just like a <code>ref</code> parameter.  </p>

<p>The final approach (and the best in most cases) is to create a type that encapsulates both values and allow the function to return that:</p>

{

"<p>I read about the dynamic control creation in ASP.NET this piece of text:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...When using dynamic controls, you
  must remember that they will exist
  only until the next postback. ASP.NET
  will not re-create a dynamically added
  control. If you need to re-create a
  control multiple times, you should
  perform the control creation in the
  Page.Load event handler. This has the
  additional benefit of allowing you to
  use view state with your dynamic
  control. Even though view state is
  normally restored before the Page.Load
  event, if you create a control in the
  handler for the Page.Load event,
  <strong>ASP.NET will apply any view state
  information that it has after the
  Page.Load event handler ends. This
  process is automatic</strong> ...</p>

Hello,

<blockquote>
  <p>Basically what is going on is once you have set the DataSourceID to null or an empty string the control takes this as an indication from the consumer of the control that they do not wish to bind any data at all (even ViewState data).

</blockquote>

<p><br /></p>

<p>So if you set DataSourceID to null inside Page_Load(), but GridView only checks DataSourceId moments before binding ( which happens much after Page_Load ), then until DataSourceId is checked, ViewState containing data from previous data source should still be available inside Page_Load() ( and still available,for example,inside an event handler subscribed to an event that caused a postback)?! </p>

"<p>I recently read the excellent article ""<a href=""http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/djg/papers/analogy%5Foopsla07.pdf"">The Transactional Memory / Garbage Collection Analogy</a>"" by Dan Grossman. One sentence really caught my attention:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In theory, garbage collection can
  improve performance by increasing
  spatial locality (due to
  object-relocation), but in practice we
  pay a moderate performance cost for
  software engineering benefits.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Until then, my feeling had always been very vague about it. Over and over, you see claims that GC <em>can</em> be more efficient, so I always kept that notion in the back of my head. After reading this, however, I started having serious doubts.</p>

<p>As an experiment to measure the impact on GC languages, some people took some Java programs, traced the execution, and then replaced garbage collection with explicit memory management. According to <a href=""http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/2552"">this review of the article</a> on <a href=""http://lambda-the-ultimate.org"">Lambda the ultimate</a>, they found out that GC was always slower. Virtual memory issues made GC look even worse, since the collector regularly touches way more memory pages than the program itself at that point, and therefore causes a lot of swapping.</p>

<p>This is all experimental to me. Has anybody, and in particular in the context of C++, performed a comprehensive benchmark of GC performance when comparing to explicit memory management?</p>

<p>Particularly interesting would be to compare how various big open-source projects, for example, perform with or without GC. Has anybody heard of such results before?</p>

<p>EDIT: And <strong>please focus on the performance problem</strong>, not on why GC exists or why it is beneficial.</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>Carl</p>

<p>PS. In case you're already pulling out the flame-thrower: I am not trying to disqualify GC, I'm just trying to get a definitive answer to the performance question.</p>
","34211","","<p>It is the fact that developers are human and miss things that caused the need for garbage collectors in the first place.  With that being said let me say that garbage collection will always be slower than <strong>perfect</strong> explicit memory management.  And garbage collection <strong>can</strong> often be faster than imperfect explicit memory management given the fact that garbage collectors clean up the things that developers tend to forget.</p>

<p>It would be nice to be able to do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>where T : integral // or ""arithmetical"" depending on how pedantic you are
</code></pre>

<p>or </p>

<pre><code>where T : IArithmetic
</code></pre>

<p>I would suggest that you read <a href=""http://www.yoda.arachsys.com/csharp/genericoperators.html"">Generic Operators</a> by our very own Marc Gravell and Jon Skeet.  It explains why this is such a difficult problem and what can be done to work around it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>.NET 2.0 introduced generics into the
  .NET world, which opened the door for
  many elegant solutions to existing
  problems. Generic constraints can be
  used to restrict the type-arguments to
  known interfaces etc, to ensure access
  to functionality - or for simple
  equality/inequality tests the
  Comparer.Default and
  EqualityComparer.Default 
  singletons implement IComparer and
  IEqualityComparer  respectively
  (allowing us to sort elements for
  instance, without having to know
  anything about the ""T"" in question).</p>
  
  <p>With all this, though, there is still
  a big gap when it comes to operators.
  Because operators are declared as
  static methods, there is no IMath
  or similar equivalent interface that
  all the numeric types implement; and
  indeed, the flexibility of operators
  would make this very hard to do in a
  meaningful way. Worse: <strong>many of the
  operators on primitive types don't
  even exist as operators; instead there
  are direct IL methods.</strong> [emphasis mine] To make the
  situation even more complex,
  Nullable&lt;> demands the concept of
  ""lifted operators"", where the inner
  ""T"" describes the operators applicable
  to the nullable type - but this is
  implemented as a language feature, and
  is not provided by the runtime (making
  reflection even more fun).</p>

"<p>A minor point about function declaration keywords in PHP: If you've got a class method that's static, should the <code>static</code> keyword come before or after the visibility keyword (<code>public</code>, <code>protected</code>, <code>private</code>)?

<p>Now pretend a couple are static:</p>

<p>I have a definitive list of Widgets in my WidgetManager.  Any other class can have a pointer to a Widget.  If I delete a Widget from my WidgetManager, I want all the other pointers to that widget (wherever they might be in the solution) to be set to null.</p>

<p>A ""destroyed"" event is raised when a Widget is removed from my WidgetManager.  I was thinking of catching that event in all the classes that store references to Widgets, and setting their references to null when Widgets were deleted.  The point of my original question is to verify that I've found all the references.</p>

<p>If anyone can think of a Better Way then let me know.</p>
","34211","","<p>Is the codebase one solution?  If so, go to that type, right click the type's name and select ""Find all references"".</p>

"<p>In C# can a constant be overridden in a derived class? I have a group of classes that are all the same bar some constant values, so I'd like to create a base class that defines all the methods and then just set the relevant constants in the derived classes. Is this possible?</p>

<p>I'd rather not just pass in these values to each object's constructor as I would like the added type-safety of multiple classes (since it never makes sense for two objects with different constants to interact).</p>
","34211","","<p>Unfortunately constants cannot be overridden as they are not virtual members.  Constant identifiers in your code are replaced with their literal values by the compiler at compile time.</p>

<p>I would suggest you try to use an abstract or virtual property for what you would like to do.  Those are virtual and as such can (must, in the case of an abstract property) be overridden in the derived type.</p>

"<p>I used to use this when I wanted to trigger errors in PHP, coming from a PHP4 background. Note I had my own <code>set_error_handler()</code> for handling these errors.</p>

<pre><code>if ($error) {
    trigger_error('Sorry, error has occured');
}
</code></pre>

<p>I can't remember where, but sometime ago someone told me I should be 'using exceptions'. As I'm re factoring a lot of my old code, I figured now is the time to get some good advice on my error handling implementation.</p>

<p>Now that I'm using PHP5 (and a bit smarter than I was when I wrote the older code), is my <code>trigger_error()</code> just an old way of doing things, and if so, what is the best way to handle errors in PHP5?</p>
","34211","","<p>Yes, you may want to start looking into the PHP 5 exception model.   Remember though that just because something is new doesn't mean that you must adopt it.  Only adopt those features that you need and make sense in your domain.</p>

<p>That being said, I feel that exceptions are a good concept to grasp and even if you decide not to adopt them you will be all the better for the experience.</p>

<p>I would like to suggest that you read <a href=""http://us2.php.net/exceptions"" rel=""nofollow"">PHP: Exceptions - Manual</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>PHP 5 has an exception model similar
  to that of other programming
  languages. An exception can be thrown,
  and caught (""catched"") within PHP.
  Code may be surrounded in a try block,
  to facilitate the catching of
  potential exceptions. Each try must
  have at least one corresponding catch
  block. Multiple catch blocks can be
  used to catch different classes of
  exeptions. Normal execution (when no
  exception is thrown within the try
  block, or when a catch matching the
  thrown exception's class is not
  present) will continue after that last
  catch block defined in sequence.
  Exceptions can be thrown (or
  re-thrown) within a catch block.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would also encourage you to read <a href=""http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/essential/exceptions/definition.html"" rel=""nofollow"">What Is an Exception?</a> (Note this is a Java tutorial but the concepts are universal)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When an error occurs within a method, the method creates an object and hands it off to the runtime system. The object, called an exception object, contains information about the error, including its type and the state of the program when the error occurred. Creating an exception object and handing it to the runtime system is called throwing an exception.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> In order to implement a global exception handler (basically in order to establish a default exception handler that will handle previously unhandled exceptions) you will want to us the <a href=""http://www.php.net/set%5Fexception%5Fhandler"" rel=""nofollow""><code>set_exception_handler</code></a> function.</p>

"<p>Why is this? I would find it <em>really</em> nice to be able to have some extension methods locked down to be used only within one of my classes. Don't really want to have certain extension methods available everywhere... and they look so much nicer than regular static methods :P</p>

<hr>

<p>For clarification:</p>

<p>The reason I want these extension methods is because I am extending a Form, which has a DataGridView on it. And I am getting very tired of lines like these:</p>

<pre><code>foreach(var row in grid.Rows.OfType&lt;DataGridViewRow&gt;().Where(r =&gt; (bool) r.Cells[checkBoxColumn.Index].Value))

foreach(var row in grid.SelectedRows.OfType&lt;DataGridViewRow&gt;().Where(r =&gt; (bool) r.Cells[checkBoxColumn.Index].Value))
</code></pre>

<p>Would like an extension method so that I could just do</p>

<pre><code>foreach(var row in grid.Rows.CheckedRows())

foreach(var row in grid.SelectedRows.CheckedRows())
</code></pre>

<p>So in other words, this extension method would not be useful at all outside this class. But it would make the code a lot cleaner. Can of course make regular methods too, and that is what I ended up doing, since this wasn't possible. </p>

<p>Aaanyways, I was just curious to know if anyone had some good arguments to why they had chosen to put a restriction like this upon where extension methods can created used. <em>Must be in a static class</em> makes total sense. <em>Can't be in a nested static class</em> doesn't... to me at least...</p>
","34211","","<p>If you own the source code of the type, why are you using extension methods?  Why don't you just make those extension methods members of the type itself?</p>

<p>Extension methods are best used to extend types that you did not create.  While they are useful tools they are a layer of indirection that should be a last resort rather than a first.  While you can use them to extend your own types it makes more sense to reserve their use for types that you did not create.</p>

"<p>What is the difference between <code>a.Equals(b)</code> and <code>a == b</code> for value types, reference types, and strings? It would seem as though a == b works just fine for strings, but I'm trying to be sure to use good coding practices.</p>
","34211","","<p>One significant difference between them is that <code>==</code> is a static binary operator that works on two instances of a type whereas <code>Equals</code> is an instance method.  The reason this matters is that you can do this:</p>

<pre><code>Foo foo = new Foo()
Foo foo2 = null;
foo2 == foo;

"<p>I have a c# dll with a number of static utility classes. they all need database access, and at the moment each class has it's own connection. this is getting to be a hassle, and I'd like a single ""provider"" of connections, so a class could just do something like ConnProvider.Query(...) where ConnProvider is a static class accessible by all the utility classes. I suppose ConnProvider would have to manage a connection pool of some sort, but I'm not entirely sure if this is the right way to implement this and if so how the internals would look. am I on the right track here? this isn't web-based, thread-safety isn't essential (but would be nice for the future), and there are only a handful of apps/machines that will be using this dll, if that helps simplify it at all.</p>

"<p>I am currently storing normalized versions of strings in my SQL Server database in lower case.  For example, in my Users table, I have a UserName and a LoweredUserName field.  Depending on the context, I either use T-SQL's LOWER() function or C#'s String.ToLower() method to generate the lower case version of the user name to fill the LoweredUserName field.  According to <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms973919.aspx"">Microsoft's guidelines</a> and <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb386042.aspx"">Visual Studio's code analysis rule CA1308</a>, I should be using C#'s String.ToUpperInvariant() instead of ToLower().  According to Microsoft, this is both a performance and globalization issue: converting to upper case is safe, while converting to lower case can cause a loss of information (for example, <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.string.toupperinvariant%28VS.85%29.aspx"">the Turkish 'I' problem</a>).</p>

<p>If I move to using ToUpperInvariant for string normalization, I will have to change my database schema as well, since my schema is based on <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms229862%28VS.80%29.aspx"">Microsoft's ASP.NET Membership</a> framework (see <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/98908/what-is-the-point-of-the-lowered-columns-in-asp-net-membership-tables"">this related question</a>), which normalizes strings to lower case.</p>

<p>Isn't Microsoft contradicting itself by telling us to use upper case normalization in C#, while it's own code in the Membership tables and procedures is using lower case normalization?  Should I switch everything to upper case normalization, or just continue using lower case normalization?</p>
","34211","","<p>To answer your first question, yes Microsoft is a bit inconsistent.  To answer your second question, no do not switch anything until you have confirmed that this is causing a bottleneck in your application.  </p>

<p>Think how much forward progress you can make on you project instead of wasting time switching everything.  Your development time is much more valuable than the savings you would get from such a change.</p>

The time and effort taken to type the attribute name above the method cannot possibly be less than the time and effort needed to write the reset code (which should be in its own method as well so you don't copy/paste a magic number everywhere).</p>

"<p>Are constructor methods in interfaces bad?</p>
","34211","","<p>Whether or not they are bad, I am not aware of any language that has the ability to specify a constructor on an interface.</p>

<p>That being said, however, I personally do not believe that the constructor of an object is part of that object's interface and as such adding a constructor to an interface would inhibit the natural flexibility that interfaces afford.</p>

"<p>In the NSObject Class Reference they talk about an ""isa instance variable"" which </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>is initialized to a data structure that describes the class</p>
</blockquote>

<p>can someone explain what I should know about this isa instance variable? What is that good for? What does isa mean? Sounds like a norm, like DIN, ISO, etc.; Any idea what that is?</p>
","34211","","<p>It is used to determine a class's inheritance path.  More formally:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When a new object is created, it is allocated memory space and its data in the form of its instance variables are initialised. Every object has at least one instance variable (inherited from NSObject) called isa, which is initialized to refer to the object's class. Through this reference, access is also afforded to classes in the object's inheritance path. - <a href=""http://www.gnu.org/software/gnustep/resources/documentation/Developer/Base/ProgrammingManual/manual%5F2.html"">Objective-C GNUstep Base Programming Manual: Objective-C</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The name <code>isa</code> comes from the OOP concept of <code>IS-A</code> which is simply a relationship between two objects like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A dog IS-A mammal.<br />
  A car IS-A vehicle.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the <code>isa</code> instance variable can be helpful in that it can tell you what <code>IS-A</code> relationships your class has in its inheritance hierarchy.</p>

"<p>Abstract classes are described as being useful for a family of objects (e.g. could be used for animals which are mammals). However, what difference is there between using an interface or abstract class for representing a family of related objects?</p>

<p>My process is to use an abstract class when I want to define common functionality but with the option for future extensions and an interface for custom functionality (implementations).</p>

<p>For example, I wrote an abstract class to encapsulate some database functionality which will be used heavily in a small web app at work. I wrote an abstract class with virtual methods which can be overrided with custom functionality in the future (e.g. logging, or some reporting of the database events which may be required).</p>

<p>Is this the right way to go? Is there any significance in choosing one construct (abstract or interface) to represent a family?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
","34211","","<p>An abstract class should be used when there is common state and behavior between all types.  An interface should be used when all types will have a common interface but will not share state or behavior.</p>

<p><strong><em>Here is an example.</em></strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>German Shepherd, Golden Retriever, Beagle</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These three objects are all dogs, and as such they share certain common state (carnivorous, 4 legs, etc.) and they also share certain overridable behavior (bark, pant, etc.).  In this instance it would make the most sense to create an abstract Dog class to hold this common state and behavior and create subtypes of Dog for each type of dog.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pencil, Pen, Chalk</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These objects have no common state and they cannot share behavior.  Yet you may notice that they do have something in common - they are cabaple of <em>writing</em>.  These objects are best build separately and without a base class and then tied together with a <code>Writable</code> interface that exposes each type's <code>Write</code> method.</p>

","34211","","<p>I would think that your implementation with a <code>StringBuilder</code> would be a bit more efficient as you are not creating any controls and only register the script once you are finished.

"<p>What are the situations and their associated benefits of using Generics over Inheritance and vice-versa, and how should they be best combined?</p>

<p>Thanks for the answer guys.</p>

<p>I'm going to try to state the motivation for this question as best I can:
I have a class as shown below:</p>

<pre><code>class InformationReturn&lt;T&gt; where T : Info
{
    InformationReturn(Employee employee, List&lt;T&gt;) { ... }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now suppose I have a repository that takes an InformationReturn argument, that has to strore different fields in a DB depending on the type of Info object T is. Is it better to create different repositories each for the type T is; one repository that uses reflection to determine the type; or is there a better way using inheritance capabilities over/with generics?</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: other client code must operate differently based on the type of T as well.</p>
","34211","","<p>Generics and inheritance are two separate things.  Inheritance is an OOP concept and generics are a CLR feature that allows you specify type parameters at compile-time for types that expose them.</p>

<p>Inheritance and generics actually work quite well together.</p>

<p><strong>Inheritance:</strong></p>

<p>Inheritance allows me to create one type:</p>

<pre><code>class Pen { }
</code></pre>

<p>and then later create another type that extends <code>Pen</code>:</p>

<pre><code>class FountainPen : Pen { }
</code></pre>

<p>This is helpful because I can reuse all the state and behavior of the base class and expose any new behavior or state in <code>FountainPen</code>.  Inheritance allows me to rapidly create a more specific version of an existing type.</p>

<p><strong>Generics:</strong></p>

<p>Generics are a CLR feature that let me create a type like this:</p>

<pre><code>class Foo&lt;T&gt; 
{
    public T Bar { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now when I use <code>Foo&lt;T&gt;</code> I can specify what the type of <code>T</code> will be by providing a generic type argument:</p>

<pre><code>Foo&lt;int&gt; foo = new Foo&lt;int&gt;();
</code></pre>

<p>Now, since I have specified that <code>T</code> shall be an <code>int</code> for the object I have just created, the type of <code>Foo.Bar</code> will also be <code>int</code> since it was declared of type <code>T</code>.</p>

"<p>While writing a game for J2ME we ran into an issue using java.lang.Integer.parseInt()</p>

<p>We have several constant values defined as hex values, for example:</p>

<pre><code>CHARACTER_RED = 0xFFAAA005;
</code></pre>

<p>During the game the value is serialized and is received through a network connection, coming in as a string representation of the hex value. In order to parse it back to an int we unsuccesfully tried  the following:</p>

<pre><code>// Response contains the value ""ffAAA005"" for ""characterId""
string hexValue = response.get(""characterId"");
// The following throws a NumberFormatException
int value = Integer.parseInt(hexValue, 16);

<p>Then I ran some tests and tried this:</p>

<pre><code>string hexValue = Integer.toHexString(0xFFAAA005);
// The following throws a NumberFormatException
int value = Integer.parseInt(hexValue, 16);

"<p>How can one programmatically fire the SelectedIndexChanged event of a ListView?</p>

<p>I've intended for the first item in my ListView to automatically become selected after the  user completes a certain action.  Code already exists within the SelectedIndexChanged event to highlight the selected item.

Moreover, a Debug.WriteLine fails to produce output, so I am rather certain that event has not fired.</p>

","34211","","<p>I would return an <code>IList&lt;T&gt;</code> as that gives the consumer of your function the greatest flexibility.  That way if the consumer of your function only needed to enumerate the sequence they can do so, but if they want to use the sequence as a list they can do that as well.</p>

<p>My general rule of thumb is to accept the least restrictive type as a parameter and return the richest type I can.  This is, of course, a balancing act as you don't want to lock yourself into any particular interface or implementation (but always, always try to use an interface).</p>

<p>This is the least presumptuous approach that you, the API developer, can take.  It is not up to you to decide how a consumer of your function will use what they send you - that is why you would return an <code>IList&lt;T&gt;</code> in this case as to give them the greatest flexibility.  Also for this same reason you would never presume to know what type of parameter a consumer will send you.

","34211","","<p>Do you have a script reference to jQuery above the script block in question?  The reason you are seeing this error is because you are using the jQuery function <strong><code>$</code></strong> without referencing jQuery itself.</p>

<p>You need to add a script reference to jQuery like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""/yourJsDir/jQuery.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

<p>if you have a local copy of jQuery.js.  Otherwise you can use Google's hosted version like this:</p>

"<p>When I first learned Python, I got used to doing this:</p>

<pre><code>  print ""text"", lineNumber, ""some dictionary"", my_dict
</code></pre>

<p>When I wrote my own logging facility, I naturally wanted to be able to hand it an arbitrarily-sized list of items, so I did this:</p>

<pre><code>def error(*args):
   print ERR_PREFIX,
   for _x in args:
      print _x,
   print ""\r\n"",

error(""text"", lineNumber, ""some dictionary"", my_dict)
</code></pre>

<p>Now I want to start using the logging package because it has a lot more goodies and I don't feel like replicating their effort.  Overall it looks like a clean design that can do a lot.  But I'm stymied by the fact that you can no longer present it with the same list of items for it to print.  Instead, I must change all my calls to something more like this:</p>

<pre><code>error(""text %d some dictionary %s"" % (lineNumber, my_dict))
</code></pre>

<p>Or, I could do something really silly like this:</p>

<pre><code>error(' '.join(map, str((""text"", lineNumber, ""some dictionary"", my_dict))))
</code></pre>

<p>The question is, why omit such an obvious usage case?  If you want to go from the typical 'print' statement straight to the new-fangled logging facility, shouldn't this be easier?</p>

<p>As a follow-up question, can you think of a way to override the Logger class to perform this?</p>
","34211","","<p>Well, printing and logging are two very different things.  It stands to reason that as such their usages could potentially be quite different as well.</p>

"<p>Is it possible to set a minimal size of a generation 0 heap in .NET?</p>

<p>I have a folowing sistuation. I have a function that allocates around 20-30 MB of 1KB objects, does something with them, and terminates, leaving all the allocated objects to be GC-ed. Now, in Performance Monitor, I can see that generation 0 heap size is 5-6 MB, which is not enough to accept all the 20-30 MB of objects that I need. When I start allocating, at some point gen0 GC starts running, and since all the objects are needed it promotes them to a gen1. Next time GC starts running, these objects get promoted in gen2. So finally around 15MB of my objects end up in the gen2 heap. These are, by my logic, temporary objects that should in no way end up in the gen2 heap.

"<p>The very act of asking this question suggests that my approach to this problem is incorrect, so I'm interested in answers which address the question directly, as well as answers which suggest a cleaner approach to what I'm doing.</p>

<p>Consider a base class which provides a standard set of services and functionalities, as well as some structure around those. By way of metaphor, let's consider the following example class:</p>

<pre><code>public class ExampleBase
{
  public void Main()
  {
    // Do something
    PreValidate(); // Extensibility point for derived classes
    // Do something else
    PostValidate(); // Extensibility point for derived classes
    // Do something else 
  }

  protected virtual void PreValidate()
  {
  }

  protected virtual void PostValidate()
  {
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The derived class can now override these virtual methods to provide some custom logic.</p>

<p><strong>Here is the question</strong>: Is it possible for the base class to discover at runtime if the derived class has taken the liberty of overriding one of these virtual methods, <em>before</em> invoking the virtual method?</p>

<p>(If it was sufficient to know the answer to this question <em>after</em> invoking the method, then you could perhaps replace the empty method in the base class with a method that sets a private flag, which would indicate the method was <em>not</em> overridden. However this might be fooled if the derived class invokes <code>base.PreValidate()</code> in its overridden implementation.)</p>

<p>Perhaps the best solution would be to use a completely different extensibility mechanism if this level of flexibility is required?</p>
","34211","","<p>You could do this:</p>

<pre><code>public abstract class ExampleBase
{
  public void Main()
  {
    // Do something
    PreValidate(); // Extensibility point for derived classes
    // Do something else
    PostValidate(); // Extensibility point for derived classes
    // Do something else 
  }

  protected abstract void PreValidate();

  protected abstract void PostValidate();

}
</code></pre>

<p>This would force all derived types to override the methods.  You are probably better off not checking this kind of thing at execution time - using an abstract type and abstract methods you are allowing the compiler to do the lifting for you to ensure that all consumers of your type override the methods.</p>

<p>If having the type be <code>abstract</code> does not work then you could always do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class ExampleBase
{
    public void Main()
    {
    	// Do something
    	PreValidate(); // Extensibility point for derived classes
    	// Do something else
    	PostValidate(); // Extensibility point for derived classes
    	// Do something else 
    }

    protected virtual void PreValidate()
    {
    	throw new NotImplementedException();
    }

    protected virtual void PostValidate()
    {
    	throw new NotImplementedException();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>But this approach moves any potential errors from compile-time to execution-time which is best avoided at all costs.</p>

","34211","","<p>The only difference is that in scenario two you are closing over the <code>e</code> variable which effectively moves the stack variable <code>e</code> into a custom type that is moved to the heap so you don't lose it.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> As for performance, no there ought not to be a significant difference between the two scenarios.  In scenario 1 you are already passing the exception as <code>state</code> to the <code>QueueUserWorkItem</code> method which internally moves that exception reference onto the heap.  The only overhead is that when you use a closure is that the compiler creates a type for you and stores any captured variables as fields on that type.</p>

","34211","","<p>C# 3 has a language extension called <em>collection initializers</em> which allow you to initialize the values of a collection in one statement.</p>

using System.Collections.Generic;

class Program
{
    static void Main()

"<p>I've read that it's unwise to use ToUpper and ToLower to perform case-insensitive string comparisons, but I see no alternative when it comes to LINQ-to-SQL. The ignoreCase and CompareOptions arguments of String.Compare are ignored by LINQ-to-SQL (if you're using a case-sensitive database, you get a case-sensitive comparison even if you ask for a case-insensitive comparison).  Is ToLower or ToUpper the best option here?  Is one better than the other?  I thought I read somewhere that ToUpper was better, but I don't know if that applies here.  (I'm doing a lot of code reviews and everyone is using ToLower.)</p>

<pre><code>Dim s = From row In context.Table Where String.Compare(row.Name, ""test"", StringComparison.InvariantCultureIgnoreCase) = 0

<p>This translates to an SQL query that simply compares row.Name with ""test"" and will not return ""Test"" and ""TEST"" on a case-sensitive database.</p>
","34211","","<p>If you pass a string that is case-insensitive into LINQ-to-SQL it will get passed into the SQL unchanged and the comparison will happen in the database.  If you want to do case-insensitive string comparisons in the database all you need to to do is create a lambda expression that does the comparison and the LINQ-to-SQL provider will translate that expression into a SQL query with your string intact.</p>

<p>For example this LINQ query:</p>

<pre><code>from user in Users
where user.Email == ""foo@bar.com""
select user

<p>gets translated to the following SQL by the LINQ-to-SQL provider:</p>

FROM [User] AS [t0]
WHERE [t0].[Email] = @p0
-- note that ""@p0"" is defined as nvarchar(11)

  real ORM must have is transparent Lazy
  Loading. If you retrieve an object
  through an ORM, you don’t want it to
  automatically pull in an entire object
  graph (not by default anyway), yet you
  don’t want to litter your code with
  checks to see if certain associations
  have been loaded yet, and then loading
  them if necessary. This is the ORM’s

"<p>I've been working on a .NET application and experiencing a memory error (I'm a java developer that can do other things), I've been thinking about performance. What I'm posting about was not the memory problem. The memory problem just started me thinking.</p>

<p>I've repeated a trend in my ASP.NET application that I've used on countless J2EE applications: using Business Entities to populate drop down lists. The more I think about it, the more I don't like it. For example, on the app I'm working we have a drop down list of current projects. A project is a graph of objects. However, to create the list we pull back all of the projects, create the graph and only use the id and display name. This seems to be a terrible waste. To be fair, the dal layer is entirely hand written. The lead architect would not allow an ORM like NHibernate.</p>

<p>I realize that all of these objects are in GEN0 and quickly garbage collected. What worries me is that I'm taxing the GC. Ever 5% of the CPU needed to process the GC is 5% of CPU I can't use else where. This site is one of the few that I really respect. What do you all think? Is it bad to use the entity model for this? Should I create a set of IdValue objects that only house the display value and id? Would creating such a view object tier (I don't suppose this will go in the business layer) just create redundant code?</p>

<p>Thanks,
JPD</p>
","34211","","<p>Don't worry about taxing the GC, it will tune itself to your application to give you optimal performance.  Yes it is best to reduce your memory footprint but I don't think it is quite as serious a problem as you imagine.</p>

<p>A good DAL that allows you to return only the data that you need will increase the performance of your application and will also decrease the amount of memory required by your application.  But whether you use ""too much"" memory or not, I imagine that in most cases the GC will be able to handle it just fine.</p>

"<p>I'm just trying to quickly debug a webservice by printing out the contents of an int and string array. Is there anyway to do this in one method?</p>

<p>I tried</p>

<pre><code>public static string ArrayToString(object[] array)
{
    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();

    foreach (Object item in array)
    {
    	sb.Append(item.ToString());
    	sb.Append("" "");

    return sb.ToString();
}

<p>Which I find strange as sending an int to the method below works</p>

<pre><code>static void PrintObject(object obj)
{
    Console.WriteLine(obj.ToString());
}
</code></pre>

<p>Is there anyway to do this in one method or am I just going to have to man up and create two separate methods?</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>Of course whether I should be using arrays at all is questionable, but the web service is already in place. </p>

	foreach (T item in list)
	{
		sb.Append(item.ToString());
		sb.Append("" "");
	}

	return sb.ToString();
}
</code></pre>

<p>The compiler will happily infer the type of <code>T</code> by the type of the list you pass in like this:</p>

"
"<p>I just came across a weird error:</p>

<pre><code>private bool GetBoolValue()
{
    //Do some logic and return true or false
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then, in another method, something like this:</p>

<pre><code>int? x = GetBoolValue() ? 10 : null;
</code></pre>

<p>Simple, if the method returns true, assign 10 to the Nullable<code>int</code> x. Otherwise, assign null to the <strong>nullable</strong> int. However, the compiler complains:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Error 1   Type of conditional expression cannot be determined because there is no implicit conversion between <code>int</code> and <code>&lt;null&gt;</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Am I going nuts?</p>
","34211","","<p>Try this:</p>

<pre><code>int? x = GetBoolValue() ? 10 : (int?)null;
</code></pre>

<p>Basically what is happening is that conditional operator is unable to determine the ""return type"" of the expression.  Since the compiler implictitly decides that <code>10</code> is an <code>int</code> it then  decides that the return type of this expression shall be an <code>int</code> as well.  Since an <code>int</code> cannot be <code>null</code> (the third operand of the conditional operator) it complains.</p>

<p>By casting the <code>null</code> to a <code>Nullable&lt;int&gt;</code> we are telling the compiler explicitly that the return type of this expression shall be a <code>Nullable&lt;int&gt;</code>.  You could have just as easily casted the <code>10</code> to <code>int?</code> as well and had the same effect.</p>

"<p>I am a PHP web programmer who is trying to learn C#.</p>

<p>I would like to know why C# requires me to specify the data type when creating a variable.</p>

<pre><code>Class classInstance = new Class();
</code></pre>

<p>Why do we need to know the data type before a class instance?</p>
","34211","","<p>One of the main reasons is that you can specify different types as long as the type on the left hand side of the assignment is a parent type of the type on the left (or an interface that is implemented on that type).</p>

<p>For example given the following types:</p>

<pre><code>class Foo { }
class Bar : Foo { }
interface IBaz { }
class Baz : IBaz { }
</code></pre>

<p>C# allows you to do this:</p>

<pre><code>Foo f = new Bar();
IBaz b = new Baz();
</code></pre>

<p>Yes, in most cases the compiler <em>could</em> infer the type of the variable from the assignment (like with the <strong><code>var</code></strong> keyword) but it doesn't for the reason I have shown above.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> As a point of order - while C# <em>is</em> strongly-typed the important distinction (as far as this discussion is concerned) is that it is in fact also a <strong><em>statically-typed</em></strong> language.  In other words the C# compiler does static type checking as compilation time.</p>
"
"<p>I have run into a couple of similar quirks regarding uint usage in both C++ and C#, and now I'm wondering on the reasoning (which may be completely different for each example).  For both of these examples, note that I am compiling with the warning levels set to maximum.</p>

<p>(1) gcc complains about comparing an int to a uint in the following, whereas vc++ does not:</p>

<pre><code>uint foo = &lt;somevalue&gt;;
if( foo == ~0 )  //right here
   ...
</code></pre>

<p>Comparing to 0 is just fine without any casting on both gcc and vc++.</p>

<p>(2) In C# 3.5, I just ran into a similiar issue.  The following works fine:</p>

<pre><code>uint foo = 1;
uint bar = 2;
</code></pre>

<p>But this gives a uint/int warning:</p>

<pre><code>bool condition = &lt;somevalue&gt;;
uint foo = condition ? 1 : 2; //right here
</code></pre>

<p>What gives, why is the compiler so sensitive about signed-ness of immediate values?  I completely understand the issue when assigning from variables, but this just doesn't make sense to me for immediate values; is there some hidden difficulty in the parsing that prevents this behavior from being allowed?  Or what?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Yes, I know I can suffix my numbers with 'u', but that sidesteps my question, which is about <em>implicitly</em> casting to the left-hand-side, not explicitly casting the right-hand-side.</p>
","34211","","<p>I can't speak for <code>gcc</code> but as for the C# 3 compiler you need to explicitly tell it that these <code>ints</code> ought to be unsigned:</p>

<pre><code>uint foo = condition ? 1U : 2U;
</code></pre>

<p>The C# compiler <strong>loves</strong> <code>ints</code> and assumes all integral values within range are <code>ints</code>.  Since your expression is using a conditional operator the compiler is too eager to assume your literal values are <code>ints</code> and then the assignment fails.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Note that I said <em>integral values</em> that are <em>within range</em> of a <code>System.Int32</code>.  Consider this example:</p>

<pre><code>using System;    

class Program    
{    
    static void Main()    
    {    
    	Console.WriteLine(1.GetType());

","34211","","<p>A quick note - I am not sure if this is true in Visual Studio 2008 but if you were to have that control in a project that you were editing with Visual Studio 2005 you would completely break intellisense with that control.

"<p>I'm doing my first javascript project that makes heavy use of objects. Because of how it works, nearly all the custom objects are done like this:</p>

<pre><code>namespaceobj = {};

    // Do Stuff

    // Do more stuff
}
// More subobjects etc.

","34211","","<p>This is a pretty big topic but what you are seeing is the difference between <em>object literal notation</em> (your first example) and JavaScript's particular brand of OOP.  The main difference you will encounter between the two is that you first example has only one, static instance while a revised version of your second example (you were close) would allow you to create multiple instances of the class.</p>

<p>I would suggest that you read <a href=""http://wsabstract.com/javatutors/oopjs.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">JavaScript and Object Oriented Programming (OOP)</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>JavaScript is an excellent language to
  write object oriented web
  applications. It can support OOP
  because it supports inheritance
  through prototyping as well as
  properties and methods. Many
  developers cast off JS as a suitable
  OOP language because they are so used
  to the class style of C# and Java.
  Many people don't realize that
  JavaScript supports inheritance. When
  you write object-oriented code it
  instantly gives you power; you can
  write code that can be re-used and
  that is encapsulated.</p>

If you write any range expression where the first term is greater than the second term the returned sequence is empty. A look at reflector suggests this is by design, but I can't really find a reason why it would have to be so.
An example to reproduce it is:</p>

  performed by the method, be careful to
  select a name that provides clarity

"<p>I have a question about events in .NET (C#).  I have had to write code for several situations in which I have a background task running and I want to notify a main thread, or controller class, that something has occurred, such as task completed, or finished copying a file, but I don't want the background task to wait for the main thread's delegate to process the event.</p>

<p>I want to do something like message passing: Send the message, but who cares what they do with it.</p>

<p><strong>For example:</strong></p>

<p>A class is written to process several processes in sequence, one after the other.  Each process needs to run on a background thread.  When work is completed, an event fires and tells the controller that it's done (let's say using OnCompleted() method)</p>

<p>The problem is that if the controller's event handler is used to start the subsequent process, the previous processes' OnComplete method stays on the call stack (never finishes executing) until the all of the processes have completed.</p>

<p>In that situation, how could the background task notify the controller class that the work is done without keeping the event raising method on the stack?</p>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong> A backup program.</p>

<p>A background thread runs to copy each file to the destination.  The background needs to <em>notify</em> the UI the last file that was copied, but it doesn't need to wait for the UI to update.  Instead, it just wants to say, ""BTW, here's some info.  Now, let me get back to work.""  The event listener shouldn't block the processing of the event raiser.</p>
","34211","","<p>It sounds like you are trying to invoke the delegates in the event's invocation list asynchronously.</p>

<p>I would suggest that you read <a href=""http://www.eggheadcafe.com/articles/asynchronous%5Fevents.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">.NET Asynchronous Events To Send Process Status To User Interface</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The .NET Framework offers us the
  concept of raising events (and other
  items) in our classes asynchronously. 
  This means that we can raise the event
  in such a way as to not have the
  subscriber to that event (typically
  the user interface) hold up the
  processing in the method that raised
  the event.  The benefit being that it
  doesn't negatively impact the
  performance of our business layer
  method.</p>

<p>What is the need for reflection in .NET? What are the situations where it comes in handy?</p>
","34211","","<p>I think the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection%5F%28computer%5Fscience%29"" rel=""nofollow"">Wikipedia article on reflection</a> is pretty good:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In computer science, reflection is the
  process by which a computer program
  can observe and modify its own
  structure and behavior. The
  programming paradigm driven by
  reflection is called reflective
  programming. It is a particular kind
  of metaprogramming.</p>
  
  <p>In many computer architectures,
  program instructions are stored as
  data - hence the distinction between
  instruction and data is merely a
  matter of how the information is
  treated by the computer and
  programming language. Normally,
  'instructions' are 'executed' and
  'data' is 'processed'; however, in
  some languages, programs can also
  treat instructions as data and
  therefore make reflective
  modifications. Reflection is most
  commonly used in high-level virtual
  machine programming languages like
  Smalltalk and scripting languages, and
  less commonly used in manifestly typed
  and/or statically typed programming
  languages such as Java and C.</p>

"<p>The problem is that I need a little extra functionality to an object of a class that I can’t change (I’m trying to add data binding support). 
The best solution that I can think of is to just write a derived class with this functionality. So I can use objects of this class instate. So now the problem is, how do I initialize the objects of the new class? I could make a constructor with the original object as a parameter and initialize the derived object with the values of this object, but to me this seems not to be the smartest solution.
It would be nice if I could do something like:</p>

<pre><code>// MyDerivedClass is derived from ObjectOfAnUnchangeableClass.
MyDerivedClass Obj = ObjectOfAnUnchangeableClass as MyDerivedClass;
</code></pre>

<p>Of cause this would not work because the ObjectOfAnUnchangeableClass does not know of MyDerivedClass. Another idea would be to have a constructor that could be “initialized” with an object. Something like:</p>

<pre><code>public MyDerivedClass(UnchangeableClass obj): base(obj){}
</code></pre>

<p>Here the idea would be that instead of having the base constructor build a new object; it could just take the existing object. </p>

<p>So I have two questions: </p>

<ol>
<li>Is there some concept in .net the supports something like mentioned above?</li>
<li>What would be the best solution to have some extra functionality in a class that can’t be changed? </li>
</ol>
","34211","","<p>Here is a third option - create a new type that does not extend <code>UnchangeableClass</code> but contains an instance of it that you can use and then expose any new methods from this new type:</p>

<pre><code>class MyDerivedClass
{
    UnchangeableClass unchangeableClass;

    public MyDerivedClass(UnchangeableClass obj)
    {
        this.unchangeableClass = obj;
    }

    // other methods to support whatever you need
}

<p>I believe this is simpler and cleaner than creating a derived type.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ajax, sometimes written as AJAX
  (shorthand for asynchronous JavaScript
  and XML), is a group of interrelated
  web development techniques used on the
  client-side to create interactive web
  applications or rich Internet
  applications. With Ajax, web
  applications can retrieve data from
  the server asynchronously in the
  background without interfering with
  the display and behavior of the
  existing page. The use of Ajax has led
  to an increase in interactive
  animation on web pages and
  better quality of Web services thanks
  to the asynchronous mode. Data is
  retrieved using the XMLHttpRequest
  object. Despite the name, the use of
  JavaScript and XML is not actually
  required, nor do the requests need to
  be asynchronous.</p>

<p>From <a href=""http://json.org/"">Introducing JSON</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language, Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999. JSON is a text format that is completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others. These properties make JSON an ideal data-interchange language.</p>

<p>From this, I think this method should be discouraged because it is giving the false impression that the datacontext is static and persisting between requests.

"<p>I know there have been similar questions on this topic but I wasn't completely sure they were solving the same problem.  So just to be clear...</p>

<p>I have an existing class library that has namespaces for types, business logic and data access.  The classes in the logic and data access namespaces are static and have basic crud methods to fill the type instances with data or take type instances that are already full and do inserts or updates in the database.</p>

<p>Now, in addition to the existing applications that reference this library directly, I want to also create a WCF service so that other applications can consume the objects and methods that way.</p>

<p>Every WCF turorial that I see creates the domain objects in the service project - but I don't want my objects defined in two places.  </p>

<p>So I was thinking I could reference serialization in my existing class library and mark the type classes as [DataContract] and the properties as [DataMember].  Then, in the WCF project, create the [ServiceContract] interfaces with [OperationContract] methods to match the static logic classes and methods from the existing library that I want to expose.  Then, from the WCF project, reference the existing class library and implement the WCF interfaces by having methods in it that call the existing library logic methods which return the existing library types.</p>

<p>Is this a good pattern?</p>
","34211","","<p>It sounds good but retrofitting serialization tends to be more trouble than it seems at first.  I would suggest that you build some lightweight data contracts into a service layer and then build a small tier that sits between your service layer and the business layer to translate the data contracts into business objects and vice-versa.</p>

<p>Are string, array, and object not considered to be ""sequences of bits of various lengths""?  Does the ""sequences of bits of various lengths"" actually means ""sequences of bits of some pre-defined lengths on the system (such as 32 bit, 64 bit, etc)""?</p>
","34211","","<p>If the languages has types like ""string"" and ""float"" then it is typed.  Whether it is <em>statically</em> typed or <em>dynamically</em> typed is another issue.  Untyped languages work with memory directly whereas typed languages have an abstraction layer over memory (the types themselves).</p>

<p>This sounds like a dynamic, weakly-typed language that relies on duck typing to operate on types, not directly on memory.  What does ""NaN"" mean in a language that has no types?  If the interpreter/compiler of the language you are using is capable of determining that a value found at a memory address is ""not a number"" then that language is type-aware.  An untyped language doesn't care about types at all - it simply manipulates memory directly.</p>

"<p>Simple question - given an <code>IList&lt;T&gt;</code> how do you perform a binary search without writing the method yourself and without copying the data to a type with build-in binary search support. My current status is the following.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>List&lt;T&gt;.BinarySearch()</code> is not a member of <code>IList&lt;T&gt;</code></li>
<li>There is no equivalent of the <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.collections.arraylist.adapter.aspx""><code>ArrayList.Adapter()</code></a> method for <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>IList&lt;T&gt;</code> does not inherit from <code>IList</code>, hence using <code>ArrayList.Adapter()</code> is not possible</li>

<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>

<p>There seems to be no build-in binary search for <code>IList&lt;T&gt;</code>. One can use <code>First()</code> and <code>OrderBy()</code> LINQ methods to search and sort, but it will likly have a performance hit. Implementing it yourself (as an extension method) seems the best you can do.</p>
","34211","","<p>You are going to have a couple of problems binary-searching an <code>IList&lt;T&gt;</code>, First ,like you mentioned, the <code>BinarySearch</code> method on the <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> is not a member of the <code>IList&lt;T&gt;</code> interface.  Second, you have no way of sorting the list prior to searching (which you must do for a binary search to work).</p>

<p>I think your best bet is to create a new <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code>, sort it, and then search.  It's not perfect but you don't have to many options if you have an <code>IList&lt;T&gt;</code>.</p>

"<p>I've been using the DateTime class in PHP because date() has the downsides of Unix Timestamp. However, neither approach detects invalid dates for months which don't have 31 days but attempt to use the 31st day.</p>

$date = new DateTime('02/31/2018');

<p>Example Output:</p>

<p><strong>Update 1:</strong>
To use checkdate() I need the component parts of the date. To get that, I will need to instantiate a DateTime object with the date string as the constructor. In the case of '02/31/2018', it will convert it to '03/03/2018' when instantiated. At that point it will be too late to run the component month, day, year through checkdate(). What is the solution?</p>

<p><strong>Update 2:</strong>
Getting the component part of the dates is easy if I force a specific format (e.g. mm/dd/yyyy), but if I accept all formats accepted by strtotime(), I cannot perform a checkdate before running it through strtotime() -> date() or DateTime::__construct -> DateTime::format().</p>

<p>Is there any way to do this?</p>
","34211","","<p>What if you did something like this:</p>

<pre><code>h1 { /* rules for everything without the class */ }
h1.class { /* rules for everything with the class */ }

"<p>I wish to make a POCO [Serializable] but not any other class members in its class hierarchy tree. I know there is [NonSerialized] which works only for fields, but is there any way to exclude them or choose specific members using [Serializable] on the POCO?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The XmlSerializer has been in .Net
  since version 1.0 and has served us
  well for everything from Remoting, Web

  However in .Net 3.0 the
  DataContractSerializer came along. 
  And all of a sudden a lot of guidance
  suggests that we should use it over
  the old tried and true XmlSerializer.
  Wcf even uses this as the default
  mechanism for serialization.  The
  question is, “Is it really better?”. 
  The verdict is yes, and no.  Like most
  things it depends on your
  implementation and what you need.  For
  Wcf, you should prefer to use the
  DataContractSerializer.  If you need
  full control over how the xml looks

"<p>I have several classes (A, B, C, ...) that all use a <code>List&lt;AnotherClass&gt;</code> to store references to 'other' objects. But 'other' is different for each of the classes A, B, C.
So
Class A contains <code>List&lt;Class_X&gt;</code>
Class B contains <code>List&lt;Class_Y&gt;</code>
Class C contains <code>List&lt;Class_Z&gt;</code></p>

<p>Instead of implementing Add / Delete / Search (etc) functions in A, B, C it seems logical to me to create a class <code>ListRef&lt;T&gt;</code> from <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code></p>

<pre><code>public class ListRef&lt;T&gt;: List&lt;T&gt;
{
    protected ListRef&lt;T&gt; ListOfObjects = null;

<p>Using the code above (is this the right code for what I want?) I don't know how I can supply the right class (Class_X, Class_Y, Class_Z) replacing/specifying <code>&lt;T&gt;</code> in the constructor of each class (A, B, C) that will use ListRef.</p>

<p>In the constructor of class A I would like to write something like:</p>

<pre><code>public A() : base&lt;Class_X&gt;
{
}

{

<p>as I would like to have ListOfObjects declared <strong>private</strong> instead of <strong>protected</strong></p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>Inside Listref I JUST want to be able to Add, Delete, Search objects. So I'm not actually using those classes (Class_X, Class_Y, Class_Z).</p>

<p>currently I have</p>

<pre><code>public class A
{
     private List&lt;Class_X&gt; ListOfObjects = null;
     A()
     {
         ListOfObjects = new List&lt;Class_X&gt;();

     {

        ListOfObjects.Add(Object);
     }
     public void Delete(Class_X Object)
     {
        ListOfObjects.Remove(Object);
     }
}
</code></pre>

<p>and the same kind of code for class B (using Class_Y)   and for class C (using class_Z).
To me it seems logical to use ONE class  ListRef to perform the Add and Delete operations and maintain the list for all classes I use.
(of course the real code is more complicated) </p>
","34211","","<p>I hope I am correctly understanding your problem.  Here is how I would do it:</p>

{
    public IList&lt;Class_X&gt; OtherObjects
    {
    	get { /* ... */ }

  <p>The HTMLEncode method applies HTML

  is useful as a quick method of
  encoding form data and other client
  request data before using it in your
  Web application. Encoding data
  converts potentially unsafe characters
  to their HTML-encoded equivalent.</p>
  
  <p>If the string to be encoded is not
  DBCS, HTMLEncode converts characters
  as follows:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>The less-than character (&lt;) is converted to <code>&amp;lt;</code>.</li>
  <li>The greater-than character (>) is converted to <code>&amp;gt;</code>.</li>
  <li>The ampersand character (&amp;) is converted to <code>&amp;amp;</code>.</li>
  <li>The double-quote character ("") is converted to <code>&amp;quot;</code>.</li>
  <li>Any ASCII code character whose code is greater-than or equal to 0x80
  is converted to <code>&amp;#&lt;number&gt;</code>, where
   is the ASCII character value.</li>
  </ul>

<p>This means that if you are going to dump some data to the request stream and that data was saved to the database from a user-entered field it will prevent users from being able to say that their first name is:</p>

    function doSomethingEvil() { /* ... */ }

<p>My question is, How do I do that and know which arg[] index to call and not overwrite the existing values?  </p>

<p>Is it as simple as always providing ALL parameters as they are set?  So my call from the Enrollment Page would instead look like this --></p>

<pre><code>        private void GetResults()
    {
        var enrollmentID = getCurrentRowVal(""EnrollmentID"");

","34211","","<p>.NET applications don't ""leak"" memory in this way.  Even if you are creating many objects a garbage collection will free any objects that have no roots to the application itself.</p>

<p>Memory leaks in .NET usually come in the form of unmanaged resources that you are using in your application (database connections, memory streams, etc.).  Instances like this in which you create multiple objects and then abandon them are not considered a memory leak since the garbage collector is able to free the memory.</p>

<p>It's mainly C with a thin veneer of C++ on it (C with static/singleton classes for scoping). Yes, it's not 'real' OO, I've been planning to do the C# conversion first to avoid creating any conversion issues while converting.</p>

<p>The hardest part is going to be rewriting the interface in either WPF/Silverlight or XNA (or both) There are pros and cons to each one, but I'm leaning towards WPF right now because of the font support, and because that way I won't have to write all the widgets. I may end up doing both, an XNA quick port, and a WPF one later.</p>

<p>There are several possible approaches to this, and I wanted to know if anyone had any experience with a conversion like this, and any suggestions or pitfalls.</p>

<p>1) Create the UI first, This involves either leaving the Graphics module as is, and converting from GDI to raw GDI like calls in XNA, and converting later to WPF one dialog at a time.</p>

<p>2) Convert the guts first, and leave the main UI in C++/CLI for now, after the guts are converted, switch over the interface one dialog at a time to WPF.</p>

<p>A related question is whether it's worth doing this module by module, or basically all at once, and whether it's better to do a rough conversion into C# and clean everythig up, or clean up everything in C++ then convert to C#.</p>

<p>The thought right now is to rewrite the event loops to use a home grown common loop like MFC, then try to convert everything at once to C#. Leave the graphics in C++ and see what breaks. After that, move to XNA and provide a WPF layer later. The last two steps are arbitrary, I think that the XNA port is going to be simpler, but using WPF basic panel may be pretty simple too.</p>

","34211","","<p>They both exist because they are both very different things.  Abstract classes permit implementation and interfaces do not.

<p>An abstract class is more powerful that an interface in the sense that it allows me to create an inheritance interface via abstract and virtual members but also provide some sort of default or base implementation if I so choose.

","34211","","<p>Remember that <code>IDisposable</code> is just a pattern and doesn't free the memory associated with the object.  This being the case the close of the <code>using</code> block will call <code>obj.Dispose</code> and the other thread that is using <code>obj</code> will continue to run.</p>

<p>This will create strange issues for you since <code>obj's</code> state may be changed while the other thread is using it (it all depends on how the <code>Dispose</code> method is implemented).  Needless to say this application of <code>IDisposable</code>, threading, and the <code>using</code> statement will be problematic at best.</p>

"<p>I am still having trouble understanding what interfaces are good for. I read a few tutorials and I still don't know what they really are for other then ""they make your classes keep promises"" and ""they help with multiple inheritance"".</p>

<p>Thats about it. I still don't know when I would even use an interface in a real work example or even when to identify when to use it.</p>

<p>From my limited knowledge of interfaces they can help because if something implements it then you can just pass the interface in allowing to pass in like different classes without worrying about it not being the right parameter.</p>

<p>But I never know what the real point of this since they usually stop short at this point from showing what the code would do after it passes the interface and if they sort of do it it seems like they don't do anything useful that I could look at and go ""wow they would help in a real world example"".</p>

<p>So what I guess I am saying is I am trying to find a real world example where I can see interfaces in action.</p>

<p>I also don't understand that you can do like a reference to an object like this:</p>

<pre><code>ICalculator myInterface = new JustSomeClass();
</code></pre>

<p>So now if I would go myInterface dot and intellisense would pull up I would only see the interface methods and not the other methods in JustSomeClass. So I don't see a point to this yet.</p>

<p>Also I started to do unit testing where they seem to love to use interfaces but I still don't understand why.</p>

<p>Like for instance this example:</p>

<pre><code>public AuthenticationController(IFormsAuthentication formsAuth)
{
    FormsAuth = formsAuth ?? new FormsAuthenticationWrapper();
}

public class FormsAuthenticationWrapper : IFormsAuthentication
{
    public void SetAuthCookie(string userName, bool createPersistentCookie)
    {
        FormsAuthentication.SetAuthCookie(userName, createPersistentCookie);
    }
    public void SignOut()
    {
        FormsAuthentication.SignOut();
    }

}

public IFormsAuthentication FormsAuth
{
    get;
    set;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Like why bother making this interface? Why not just make FormsAuthenticationWrapper with the methods in it and call it a day? Why First make an interface then have the Wrapper implement the interface and then finally write the methods?</p>

<p>Then I don't get what the statement is really saying.</p>

<p>Like I know know that the statement is saying this</p>

<p>FormsAuth = formsAuth ?? new FormsAuthenticationWrapper();</p>

<p>if formsAuth is null then make a new FormsAuthenticationWrapper and then assign it to the property that is an Interface.</p>

<p>I guess it goes back to the whole point of why the reference thing. Especially in this case since all the methods are exactly the same. The Wrapper does not have any new methods that the interface does not have and I am not sure but when you do this the methods are filled right(ie they have a body) they don't get converted to stubs because that would really seem pointless to me(it it would be converted back to an interface).</p>

<p>Then in the testing file they have:</p>

<pre><code>var formsAuthenticationMock = new Mock&lt;AuthenticationController.IFormsAuthentication&gt;();
</code></pre>

<p>So they just pass in the FormsAuthentication what I am guessing makes all the fake stubs. I am guessing the wrapper class is used when the program is actually running since it has real methods that do something(like sign a person out).</p>

<p>But looking at new Mock(from moq) it accepts a class or an interface. Why not just again made the wrapper class put those methods in and then in the new Mock call that?</p>

<p>Would that not just make the stubs for you?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
","34211","","<p>Perhaps the best way to get a good understanding of interfaces is to use an example from the .NET framework.</p>

<p>Consider the following function:</p>

<pre><code>void printValues(IEnumerable sequence)
{
    foreach (var value in sequence)
    	Console.WriteLine(value);
}

<p>Now I could have written this function to accept a <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code>, <code>object[]</code>, or any other type of concrete sequence.  But since I have written this function to accept a parameter of type <code>IEnumerable</code> that means that I can pass any concrete type into this function that implements the <code>IEnumerable</code> interface.</p>

<p>The reason this is desirable is that by using the interface type your function is more flexible than it would otherwise be.  Also you are increasing the utility of this function as many different callers will be able to make use of it without requiring modification.</p>

<p>By using an interface type you are able to declare the type of your parameter as a contract of what you need from whatever concrete type is passed in.  In my example I don't care what type you pass me, I just care that I can iterate it.</p>

<p>He states that instead of, say, creating a Person class that contains all of the data and methods applicable, you should create both a Person struct and and Person class. The struct contains what would normally be the properties for the Person class, and the class contains only methods. Since the Person struct sits on the stack, the data associated with your person goes away as soon as your method or whatever pops off of the stack instead of being garbage collected on the heap as with an object.</p>

<p>This is supposed to save memory and make the garbage collection process faster.</p>

<p>The question is: How big of an effect could this produce and is it really worth it?</p>
","34211","","<p>To be totally honest I don't believe you will see much of a performance benefit from doing this.  Structs are hard to write well and a poorly written struct is far more dangerous than taxing the garbage collector.</p>

<p>It sounds like your professor is advocating the use of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data%5FTransfer%5FObject"" rel=""nofollow"">data transfer objects</a> which would encourage the separation of state and behavior.  This can be a good design if done properly (and in most cases you would implement this pattern using classes, not structs).  </p>

<p>The reason I say that using a struct may be more dangerous is that value types are handled much more differently by the CLR and if written poorly (e.g. a mutable struct) can create terrible headaches.  Also, if your type contains many fields and then is passed from method to method you will be copying every field's value on each method call thus using more memory than if you had used a class in the first place.</p>
"
"<p>I fully realize that what I am proposing does not follow the .NET guidelines, and, therefore, is probably a poor idea for this reason alone. However, I would like to consider this from two possible perspectives:</p>

<p>(1) Should I consider using this for my own development work, which is 100% for internal purposes.</p>

<p>(2) Is this a concept that the framework designers could consider changing or updating?</p>

<p>I am thinking about using an event signature that utilizes a strong typed 'sender', instead of typing it as 'object', which is the current .NET design pattern. That is, instead of using a standard event signature that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>class Publisher
{
    public event EventHandler&lt;PublisherEventArgs&gt; SomeEvent;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I am considering using an event signature that utilizes a strong-typed 'sender' parameter, as follows:</p>

<p>First, define a ""StrongTypedEventHandler"":</p>

<pre><code>[SerializableAttribute]
public delegate void StrongTypedEventHandler&lt;TSender, TEventArgs&gt;(
    TSender sender,
    TEventArgs e
)
where TEventArgs : EventArgs;
</code></pre>

<p>This is not all that different from an Action&lt;TSender, TEventArgs&gt;, but by making use of the <code>StrongTypedEventHandler</code>, we enforce that the TEventArgs derives from <code>System.EventArgs</code>.</p>

<p>Next, as an example, we can make use of the StrongTypedEventHandler in a publishing class as follows:</p>

<pre><code>class Publisher
{
    public event StrongTypedEventHandler&lt;Publisher, PublisherEventArgs&gt; SomeEvent;

    protected void OnSomeEvent()
    {
        if (SomeEvent != null)
        {
            SomeEvent(this, new PublisherEventArgs(...));
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The above arrangement would enable subscribers to utilize a strong-typed event handler that did not require casting:</p>

<pre><code>class Subscriber
{
    void SomeEventHandler(Publisher sender, PublisherEventArgs e)
    {   		
        if (sender.Name == ""John Smith"")
        {
            // ...
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I do fully realize that this breaks with the standard .NET event-handling pattern; however, keep in mind that contravariance would enable a subscriber to use a traditional event handling signature if desired:</p>

<pre><code>class Subscriber
{
    void SomeEventHandler(object sender, PublisherEventArgs e)
    {   		
        if (((Publisher)sender).Name == ""John Smith"")
        {
            // ...
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>That is, if an event handler needed to subscribe to events from disparate (or perhaps unknown) object types, the handler could type the 'sender' parameter as 'object' in order to handle the full breadth of potential sender objects.</p>

<p>Other than breaking convention (which is something that I do not take lightly, believe me) I cannot think of any downsides to this.</p>

<p>There may be some CLS compliance issues here. This does run in Visual Basic .NET 2008 100% fine (I've tested), but I believe that the older versions of Visual Basic .NET through 2005 do not have delegate covariance and contravariance. <em>[Edit: I have since tested this, and it is confirmed: VB.NET 2005 and below cannot handle this, but VB.NET 2008 is 100% fine. See ""Edit #2"", below.]</em> There may be other .NET languages that also have a problem with this, I can't be sure.</p>

<p>But I do not see myself developing for any language other than C# or Visual Basic .NET, and I do not mind restricting it to C# and VB.NET for .NET Framework 3.0 and above. (I could not imagine going back to 2.0 at this point, to be honest.)</p>

<p>Can anyone else think of a problem with this? Or does this simply break with convention so much that it makes people's stomachs turn?</p>

<p>Here's a full working example that shows that both strong-typed event handlers and the current standard event handlers that use a 'object sender' parameter can co-exist with this approach. You can copy-paste in the code and give it a run:</p>

<pre><code>namespace csScrap.GenericEventHandling
{
    class PublisherEventArgs : EventArgs
    {
        // ...
    }

    [SerializableAttribute]
    public delegate void StrongTypedEventHandler&lt;TSender, TEventArgs&gt;(
        TSender sender,
        TEventArgs e
    )
    where TEventArgs : EventArgs;

    class Publisher
    {
        public event StrongTypedEventHandler&lt;Publisher, PublisherEventArgs&gt; SomeEvent;

        public void OnSomeEvent()
        {
            if (SomeEvent != null)
            {
                SomeEvent(this, new PublisherEventArgs());
            }
        }
    }

    class StrongTypedSubscriber
    {
        public void SomeEventHandler(Publisher sender, PublisherEventArgs e)
        {
            MessageBox.Show(""StrongTypedSubscriber.SomeEventHandler called."");
        }
    }

    class TraditionalSubscriber
    {
        public void SomeEventHandler(object sender, PublisherEventArgs e)
        {
            MessageBox.Show(""TraditionalSubscriber.SomeEventHandler called."");
        }
    }

    class Tester
    {
        public static void Main()
        {
            Publisher publisher = new Publisher();

            StrongTypedSubscriber strongTypedSubscriber = new StrongTypedSubscriber();
            TraditionalSubscriber traditionalSubscriber = new TraditionalSubscriber();

            publisher.SomeEvent += strongTypedSubscriber.SomeEventHandler;
            publisher.SomeEvent += traditionalSubscriber.SomeEventHandler;

            publisher.OnSomeEvent();
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Edit #2:</strong> This is in response to <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1046016/event-signature-in-net-using-a-strong-typed-sender/1046041#1046041"">Andrew Hare's statement</a> regarding covariance and contravariance and how it applies here. Delegates in the C# language have had covariance and contravariance for so long that it just feels ""intrinsic"", but it's not. It might even be something that is enabled in the CLR, I don't know, but Visual Basic .NET did not get covariance and contravariance capability for its delegates until the .NET Framework 3.0 (VB.NET 2008). And as a result, Visual Basic.NET for .NET 2.0 and below would not be able to utilize this approach.</p>

<p>For example, the above example can be translated into VB.NET as follows:</p>

<pre><code>Namespace GenericEventHandling
    Class PublisherEventArgs
        Inherits EventArgs
        ' ...
        ' ...
    End Class

    &lt;SerializableAttribute()&gt; _
    Public Delegate Sub StrongTypedEventHandler(Of TSender, TEventArgs As EventArgs) _
        (ByVal sender As TSender, ByVal e As TEventArgs)

    Class Publisher
        Public Event SomeEvent As StrongTypedEventHandler(Of Publisher, PublisherEventArgs)

        Public Sub OnSomeEvent()
            RaiseEvent SomeEvent(Me, New PublisherEventArgs)
        End Sub
    End Class

    Class StrongTypedSubscriber
        Public Sub SomeEventHandler(ByVal sender As Publisher, ByVal e As PublisherEventArgs)
            MessageBox.Show(""StrongTypedSubscriber.SomeEventHandler called."")
        End Sub
    End Class

    Class TraditionalSubscriber
        Public Sub SomeEventHandler(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As PublisherEventArgs)
            MessageBox.Show(""TraditionalSubscriber.SomeEventHandler called."")
        End Sub
    End Class

    Class Tester
        Public Shared Sub Main()
            Dim publisher As Publisher = New Publisher

            Dim strongTypedSubscriber As StrongTypedSubscriber = New StrongTypedSubscriber
            Dim traditionalSubscriber As TraditionalSubscriber = New TraditionalSubscriber

            AddHandler publisher.SomeEvent, AddressOf strongTypedSubscriber.SomeEventHandler
            AddHandler publisher.SomeEvent, AddressOf traditionalSubscriber.SomeEventHandler

            publisher.OnSomeEvent()
        End Sub
    End Class
End Namespace
</code></pre>

<p>VB.NET 2008 can run it 100% fine. But I've now tested it on VB.NET 2005, just to be sure, and it does not compile, stating:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Method 'Public Sub
  SomeEventHandler(sender As Object, e
  As
  vbGenericEventHandling.GenericEventHandling.PublisherEventArgs)'
  does not have the same signature as
  delegate 'Delegate Sub
  StrongTypedEventHandler(Of TSender,
  TEventArgs As System.EventArgs)(sender
  As Publisher, e As
  PublisherEventArgs)'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basically, delegates are invariant in VB.NET versions 2005 and below. I actually thought of this idea a couple of years ago, but VB.NET's inability to deal with this bothered me... But I've now moved solidly to C#, and VB.NET can now handle it, so, well, hence this post.</p>

<p><strong>Edit: Update #3</strong></p>

<p>Ok, I have been using this quite successfully for a while now. It really is a nice system. I decided to name my ""StrongTypedEventHandler"" as ""GenericEventHandler"", defined as follows:</p>

<pre><code>[SerializableAttribute]
public delegate void GenericEventHandler&lt;TSender, TEventArgs&gt;(
    TSender sender,
    TEventArgs e
)
where TEventArgs : EventArgs;
</code></pre>

<p>Other than this renaming, I implemented it exactly as discussed above.</p>

<p>It does trip over FxCop rule CA1009, which states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""By convention, .NET events have two
  parameters that  specify the event
  sender and event data. Event handler 
  signatures should follow this form:
  void MyEventHandler( object sender,
  EventArgs e). The 'sender' parameter 
  is always of type System.Object, even
  if it is possible  to employ a more
  specific type. The 'e' parameter is 
  always of type System.EventArgs.
  Events that do not  provide event data
  should use the System.EventHandler 
  delegate type. Event handlers return
  void so that they  can send each event
  to multiple target methods. Any  value
  returned by a target would be lost
  after the  first call.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, we know all this, and are breaking the rules anyway. (All event handlers can use the standard 'object Sender' in their signature if preferred in any case -- this is a non-breaking change.)</p>

<p>So the use of a <code>SuppressMessageAttribute</code> does the trick:</p>

<pre><code>[SuppressMessage(""Microsoft.Design"", ""CA1009:DeclareEventHandlersCorrectly"",
    Justification = ""Using strong-typed GenericEventHandler&lt;TSender, TEventArgs&gt; event handler pattern."")]
</code></pre>

<p>I hope that this approach becomes the standard at some point in the future. It really works very nicely.</p>

<p>Thanks for all your opinions guys, I really appreciate it...</p>

","34211","","<p>Reflection is slow because you are querying the assembly's metadata whereas casting simply changes the type of the object you are referencing.</p>

<p>The assembly's metadata is a useful store of information but that information is best used at <em>compilation time</em> rather than at execution time.  That metadata is used by the compiler for static type checking (among other things).  You are using that same metadata to look up type information at execution time (which is fine if you have no other choice) which is significantly slower than casting.</p>

didn't go that well. Others questions were 'why isn't it
recommended to  use an ArrayList of int', 'tell me what you
know about threading', etc.</p>

<p>I don't really want this to happen again so I'm planning to
spend some time reading (and practising) more on C#. I
understand that the best way of learning is by coding but
coding wouldn't have really helped me answer the question
about 'boxing' for example.</p>

C# developer have? Ideally it would be better if you could
categorize it (Basic knwoledge anyone should have without

"<p>When writing apps with asp.net, which I do more of than vb.net apps, I have always followed the rule of opening a connection to the server, getting the data, and closing the connection as quickly as possible. This seems like a best practice.</p>

<p>Is it equally important to do this on a client/server vb.net app? For example, if you had multiple forms, each either with a grid of data, or a form of data, would you typically open the connection when each form started, close it when the user left the form? or is it  acceptable to define a global variable for the connection and keep it open the entire life span of the app?</p>

Currently the ASP.NET site sits on top of a separate cut down version of the back office database (we call this the web database).

"<p>I have a control and it provides a selection mechanism. However, the items that it selects are not appropriate for general consumption and instead, must be projected into a different type parameterised by date.</p>

<p>In addition to this, there are some controls that want to encapsulate the same information and, more importantly, want to retain a particular selection even if the original control's selection has changed. Therefore, just chaining methods doesn't work because the original control's method will always return the projection of its current selection.</p>

<p>To work around this, I created a property that returns a closure, which performs the projection based on a specific selection. This way, I can encapsulate the projection and protect the real type being projected, but also encapsulate a specific collection. Here is a simplified version of what I have.</p>

<pre><code>public class MySelectionControl
{
  public Func&lt;DateTime, IEnumerable&lt;MyProjectedType&gt;&gt; CreateSelectionForDate
  {
    get
    {
       // Take a copy of the selection before creating the lambda so
       // that the source items won't change if the selection does.
       IEnumerable&lt;MyRealType&gt; copyOfSelection = this.realSelection.ToList();
       return weekEnding =&gt;
          copyOfSelection.Select(x =&gt; new MyProjectedType(x, weekEnding));
    }
  }
}

<p>This can then be called like a method as in:</p>

<pre><code>MySelectionControl control = new MySelectionControl();

// Gives the current selection for a given date.
control.CreateSelectionForDate(DateTime.Today);

// Takes a copy of the selection for later use, regardless of
// whether the original selection changes.
var selectedItemsProjection = control.CreateSelectionForDate;

<p>A sample of the source data is included below. Each line represents a cell in the source.</p>

<p>I'm looking for a regex that matches ""abms feature = XXX"" where XXX is a varibale length word - no spaces in it and I think all alpha characters. Once I find a match, I want to toss out the ""abms feature = "" portion of the match and place the code (the XXX part) into another column.</p>

<p>I can handle the excel coding part. I just need help with the regex.</p>

<p>If you can provide a solution to do this entirely within Excel - no coding required, just using native excel formula and commands - I would like to hear that, too.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

  the difference between greedy and lazy
  repetition. Greediness and laziness
  determine the order in which the regex
  engine tries the possible permutations
  of the regex pattern. A greedy
  quantifier will first try to repeat
  the token as many times as possible,
  and gradually give up matches as the
  engine backtracks to find an overall
  match. A lazy quantifier will first
  repeat the token as few times as
  required, and gradually expand the
  match as the engine backtracks through
  the regex to find an overall match.</p>

- part of it</p>

Another part is pulling data back from many different database sources.  I have different users with different needs.  I was looking for a solution to them all.  I could have several differnet languages and frameworks if I wanted - which is what I have now on a Microsoft server, but I was looking for one consistent way of doing things.  It's a big consolidation but I don't want to buy something websphere to do it.</p>

- not sure what to say, jdbc, crud, or just read, it varies based up on the need of a particular web page</p>

- probably 1000 but it may grow.  If I move some of it to an Internet app that part can have thousands.</p>

<p>Since a List&lt;T&gt; implements IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;, one would think that my class would implement the interface. Can someone explain what the rationale is for this not compiling?</p>

<ol>
<li>Change the interface to be more specific and require IList be implemented.</li>
<li>Change my class (MyData) to return IEnumerable and implement the original interface.</li>

    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I could change my interface to require IList to be implemented (option 1), but that limits who can implement the interface and the number of classes that can be passed into ConsumerA. Or, I could change implementation (class MyData) so that it returns an IEnumerable instead of a List (option 2), but then ConsumerB would have to be rewritten.</p>

<p>This seems to be a shortcoming of C# unless someone can enlighten me.</p>
","34211","","<p>Interfaces require that the signature of the method match with the signature of the contract <em>exactly</em>.</p>

<p>Here is a simpler example that also will not compile:</p>

<pre><code>interface IFoo

}

class Foo : IFoo
{
    public String GetFoo() { return """"; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now as for what to do about it I would let the interface dictate the implementation.  If you want the contract to be <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code> then that is what it should be in the class as well.  The interface is the most important thing here as the implementation is free to be as flexible as it needs to be.</p>

<p>Just be certain that <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code> is the best choice here.  (This is all highly subjective as I don't know much about your domain or the purpose of these types in your application.  Good luck!)</p>

"<p>I want to create a static class or singleton class that accepts a reference to another object in its constructor. Static classes are out, but I figured I could create a singleton that accepts parameters in its constructor. So far I haven't had any luck figuring out or googling the syntax. Is this possible? if so, how do I do it? </p>

<p>Sorry for no example in the initial post, I wrote it in a rush. I have the feeling that my answer is already in the replies, but here's some clarification of what I want to do:</p>

<p>I want to create a single instance of a specific type (said Singleton), but that single instance of the type needs to hold a reference to a different object. </p>

<p>For example, I might want to create a Singleton ""Status"" class, which owns a StringBuilder object and a Draw() method that can be called to write said StringBuilder to the screen. The Draw() method needs to know about my GraphcisDevice in order to draw.
So what I want to do it this:</p>

<pre><code>public class Status
{
private static Status _instance;
private StringBuilder _messages;
private GraphicsDevice _gDevice;

private Status(string message, GraphicsDevice device)
{
    _messages.Append(message);
    _gDevice = device;
}

// The following isn't thread-safe

// This constructor part is what I'm trying to figure out
public static Status Instance // (GraphicsDevice device) 
    {
    get
        {
        if (_instance == null)
            {
            _instance = new Status(""Test Message!"", device); 
            }
        return _instance;
        }
    }

public void UpdateMessage
...

public void Draw()
    {
    // Draw my status to the screen, using _gDevice and _messages
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>All over the code, I retrieve my Status Singleton and call its UpdateMessage() method.</p>

<pre><code>private Status _status = Status.Instance; // + pass reference to GraphicsDevice
_status.UpdateMessage(""Foo!"");
</code></pre>

<p>Then, in my main class I also retrieve the singleton, and draw it:</p>

<pre><code>_status.Draw();
</code></pre>

<p>Yes, this means that wherever I retrieve the singleton, I need to do so by passing in the reference to the GraphicsDevice, in case it's the first time I instantiate the Singleton. And I could/would use different means to retrieve something as fundamental as the GraphicsDevice in my Singleton class, for example register a service elsewhere and get that service in the Status class. This example got pretty contrived - I'm trying to figure out if <em>something</em> like this pattern is possible in the first place.</p>
","34211","","<p>This is generally considered a bad idea because if you are going to accept either an object reference or a type argument that you plan on wrapping in a singleton-like wrapper you cannot guarantee that you hold the only instance of that type in the AppDomain.</p>

<p>The whole point of the singleton pattern is to control a single instance of a type so that only one instance of that type can exist.  If you allow an instance to be passed in or if you make a generic singleton provider you cannot guarantee that your instance is the <em>only</em> instance.</p>

<p>Let's say that I had a <code>SingletonFactory&lt;T&gt;</code> that would allow me to create a singleton around any type that I pass to the factory.  That would be quite handy and would allow me to do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>SingletonFactory&lt;Foo&gt;.Instance;
</code></pre>

<p>But what stops me from also doing this:</p>

<pre><code>Foo foo = new Foo();
</code></pre>

<p>Oops, it looks like <code>Foo</code> isn't a singleton anymore as I can create as many instances of it as I wish.  In order for the singleton pattern to work you need to be able to completely control the type whose instances you need to restrict.  This is why you ought not to use anything like my <code>SingletonFactory&lt;T&gt;</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>The same goes for a non-generic singleton that accepts an object instance.  I am sure that you can extrapolate from my previous example many similar reasons why a singleton wrapper that accepts and object reference would also be a bad idea.</em></p>

"<p>My colleague and I have been having a discussion about what Collections should be called.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>Class Product - Collection - Class Products</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>Class Product - Collection - Class ProductCollection</p>

<p>I've had a look around to see if I can see any guidelines or reasons for using one or the other but nothing seems to spring out. The framework seems to use both variants for example. The argument I can see is that a class that has a collection of products variable should be called Products but it should be of type ProductCollection.</p>

<p>Which is correct if any?</p>

<p>In the same vane is there a standard for the naming of return variable for a function. e.g. retVal?</p>

<p>We mainly code in C#, although I'm not sure that affects my question.</p>
","34211","","<p>I would say that with generics there should rarely ever be a reason to create a custom collection type.  But if you must I would say that <code>ProductCollection</code> would best fit the naming conventions of the framework.  </p>

<p>Still, consider using a <code>List&lt;Product&gt;</code> or <code>Collection&lt;Product&gt;</code> or better yet <code>IList&lt;Product&gt;</code> or <code>ICollection&lt;Product&gt;</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> <em>This is in response to MrEdmundo's comments below.</em></p>

<p>In your case you have two choices.  The most obvious choice would be to use inheritance like this:</p>

<pre><code>class Ball { }

class BallCollection : List&lt;Ball&gt;
{
    public String Color { get; set; }
    public String Material { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I say obvious because it <em>seems</em> like the best idea at first glance but after a bit of thought it becomes clear that this is not the best choice.  What if you or Microsoft creates a new <code>SuperAwesomeList&lt;T&gt;</code> and you want to use that to improve the performance of your <code>BallCollection</code> class?  It would be difficult because you are tied to the <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> class through inheritance and changing the base class would potentially break any code that uses <code>BallCollection</code> as a <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code>.  </p>

<p>So what is the better solution?  I would recommend that in this case you would be better off to favor <em>composition</em> over inheritance.  So what would a composition-based solution look like?</p>

<pre><code>class Ball { }

class BallCollection
{
    public String Color { get; set; }
    public String Material { get; set; }
    public IList&lt;Ball&gt; Balls { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that I have declared the <code>Balls</code> property to be of type <code>IList&lt;T&gt;</code>.  This means that you are free to implement the property using whatever type you wish as long as that type implements <code>IList&lt;T&gt;</code>.  This means that you can freely use a <code>SuperAwesomeList&lt;T&gt;</code> at any point which makes this type significantly more scalable and much less painful to maintain.</p>

"<p>This question has been puzzling me for a long time now. I come from a heavy and long C++ background, and since I started programming in C# and dealing with garbage collection I always had the feeling that such 'magic' would come at a cost. </p>

<p>I recently started working in a big MMO project written in Java (server side). My main task is to optimize memory comsumption and CPU usage. Hundreds of thousands of messages per second are being sent and the same amount of objects are created as well. After a lot of profiling we discovered that the VM garbage collector was eating a lot of CPU time (due to constant collections) and decided to try to minimize object creation, using pools where applicable and reusing everything we can. This has proven to be a really good optimization so far.</p>

<p>So, from what I've learned, having a garbage collector is awesome, but you can't just pretend it does not exist, and you still need to take care about object creation and what it implies (at least in Java and a big application like this).</p>

<p>So, is this also true for .NET? if it is, to what extent?</p>

<p>I often write pairs of functions like these:</p>

<pre><code>// Combines two envelopes and the result is stored in a new envelope.
public static Envelope Combine( Envelope a, Envelope b )
{
    var envelope = new Envelope( _a.Length, 0, 1, 1 );
    Combine( _a, _b, _operation, envelope );
    return envelope;
}

// Combines two envelopes and the result is 'written' to the specified envelope
public static void Combine( Envelope a, Envelope b, Envelope result )
{
    result.Clear();
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>A second function is provided in case someone has an already made Envelope that may be reused to store the result, but I find this a little odd.</p>

<p>I also sometimes write structs when I'd rather use classes, just because I know there'll be tens of thousands of instances being constantly created and disposed, and this feels really odd to me.</p>

<p>I know that as a .NET developer I shouldn't be worrying about this kind of issues, but my experience with Java and common sense tells me that I should.</p>

<p>Any light and thoughts on this matter would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>From <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.decimal.aspx"" rel=""nofollow""><code>System.Decimal</code></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A decimal number is a floating-point
  value that consists of a sign, a
  numeric value where each digit in the
  value ranges from 0 to 9, and <strong><em>a
  scaling factor that indicates the
  position of a floating decimal point
  that separates the integral and
  fractional parts of the numeric value.</em></strong></p>
  
  <p>The binary representation of a Decimal
  value consists of a 1-bit sign, a
  96-bit integer number, and a scaling
  factor used to divide the 96-bit
  integer and specify what portion of it
  is a decimal fraction. The scaling
  factor is implicitly the number 10,
  raised to an exponent ranging from 0
  to 28. Therefore, the binary
  representation of a Decimal value is
  of the form, ((-2<sup>96</sup> to 2<sup>96</sup>) / 10<sup>(0 to
  28)</sup>), where -2<sup>96</sup>-1 is equal to
  MinValue, and 2<sup>96</sup>-1 is equal to
  MaxValue.</p>
  
  <p><em><strong>The scaling factor also preserves any
  trailing zeroes in a Decimal number.
  Trailing zeroes do not affect the
  value of a Decimal number in
  arithmetic or comparison operations.
  However, trailing zeroes can be
  revealed by the ToString method if an

  literal, the characters between the
  delimiters are interpreted verbatim,
  the only exception being a
  quote-escape-sequence. In particular,
  simple escape sequences and

"<p>A common pattern in the .NET Framework is the TryXXX pattern (I don't know if that's what they really call it), in which the called method attempts to do something, returning <code>True</code> if it was successful, or <code>False</code> if the operation failed.  A good example is the generic <code>Dictionary.TryGetValue</code> method.</p>

<p>Documentation for these methods say that they will not throw exceptions:  that failure will be reported in the method return value.  All good so far.</p>

<p>I recently encountered two different circumstances in which .NET Framework methods that implement the TryXXX pattern threw exceptions.  See <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1148278/bug-in-system-random-constructor"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1148278/bug-in-system-random-constructor</a> and <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1120283/uri-trycreate-throws-uriformatexception"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1120283/uri-trycreate-throws-uriformatexception</a> for details.</p>

<p>In both cases, the <code>TryXXX</code> method called other methods that threw unexpected exceptions, and those exceptions escaped.  My question:  does this break the implied contract of not throwing exceptions?</p>

<p>Put another way, if you were writing <code>TryFoo</code>, would you guarantee that exceptions cannot escape, by writing it like this?</p>

<pre><code>public bool TryFoo(string param, out FooThing foo)
{
    try
    {
        // do whatever
        return true;
    }
    catch
    {
        foo = null;
        return false;
    }
}

<p>It's tempting, because that guarantees no exceptions will escape, thereby honoring the implied contract.  But it's a bug hider.</p>

<p>My gut feeling, based on my experience, says that this is a really bad idea.  But if <code>TryFoo</code> lets some exceptions escape, then what it's really saying is, ""I won't throw any exceptions that I know how to handle,"" and then the whole idea of the contract ""I won't throw exceptions"" is thrown out the window.</p>

<p>So, what's your opinion? Should <code>TryFoo</code> handle all exceptions, or just those that it's expecting to happen?  What's your reasoning?</p>
","34211","","<p>The idea behind <code>TryXXX</code> is that it will not throw a specific type of exception that will normally occur if you simply called the corresponding <code>XXX</code> call - the consumer of the method knows that they are ignoring any exception that would normally occur.</p>

<blockquote>

  installing WCF (as part of the .net
  Framework 3.0), including the Visual

  a first simple ""Hello World"" service
  to demonstrate some of the key
  concepts of the platform. The samples
  are all in C#, but I can spin off
  VB.Net equivalents if there is
  sufficient interest. Also, previous
  versions of this series (that targeted
  various pre-release versions of WCF)
  used Notepad and the command line to
  build and compile WCF services. This
  latest version makes use of Visual
  Studio because, especially with the
  RTM release, I suspect that is what
  most readers will be using. If you're
  interested in crafting your services
  by hand to explore the underpinnings
  of WCF more closely (or to obtain the

"<p>In many applications when you make a mistake in either your user name or password you get a non-specific error indicating that either the user name entered does not exist or the password is incorrect for that user name.</p>

<p>I (naively) would expect the application to specify <em>which</em> one of the two errors happened.  Is there any reason for not differentiating between them?

"<p>In the same way we have coding standards, can there be things such as architecture standards?</p>

<p>These would be high level principals that we can pass to our less experienced programmers so when they start designing changes or small applications they know what we expect to see without the more experienced programmers having to correct them (note this isn't instead of review, just preventing obvious mistakes as early as possible).</p>

<p>I'm thinking potentially it could contain things such as ""Always normalise your database unless there is a specific and clearly understood reason for not doing so"", ""Always separate out presentation, logic and persistence"".</p>

<p>Do people think that this would be too high level to be of any practical use?  Or that such generalisations are almost impossible given the variety of functionality we might be asked to code?  Or might it be useful?</p>

"<p>I'm new to C#, and just started using XmlElement and its SelectSingleNode method. In my XML file there's a tag that may have a value (i.e. <code>&lt;tag&gt;value&lt;/tag&gt;</code>) or be empty (i.e. <code>&lt;tag&gt;&lt;/tag&gt;</code>). If it's empty, SelectSingleNode returns null. </p>

<p>I'm currently using the following code to catch the value of the tag:</p>

<pre><code>XmlElement elem = ....
string s = elem.SelectSingleNode(""somepath"").Value;
</code></pre>

<p>This code obviously raises an exception for empty tags. However, for me an empty tag is a valid value, where I expect the value of my string to be """".</p>

<p>Wrapping each call to SelectSingleNode with try...catch seems a huge waste of code (I have many fields that may be empty), and I'm sure there's a better way to achieve this.</p>

  <p>While C# has a set of capabilities

  new and interesting features.
  Delegation is the ability to treat a
  method as a first-class object. A C#
  delegate is used where Java developers
  would use an interface with a single
  method. In this article, the use of
  delegates in C# is discussed, and code
  is presented for a Java Delegate

","34211","","<p>Here are some good links to get you started.  Understanding <em>how</em> the ASP.NET life-cycle fits together is critical to understanding how your code will interact with it.</p>

<p><a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms178472.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">ASP.NET Page Life Cycle Overview</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When an ASP.NET page runs, the page
  goes through a life cycle in which it
  performs a series of processing steps.
  These include initialization,
  instantiating controls, restoring and
  maintaining state, running event
  handler code, and rendering. It is
  important for you to understand the
  page life cycle so that you can write
  code at the appropriate life-cycle
  stage for the effect you intend.
  Additionally, if you develop custom
  controls, you must be familiar with
  the page life cycle in order to
  correctly initialize controls,
  populate control properties with
  view-state data, and run any control
  behavior code. (The life cycle of a
  control is based on the page life
  cycle, but the page raises more events
  for a control than are available for
  an ASP.NET page alone.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""http://www.15seconds.com/issue/020102.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">The ASP.NET Page Life Cycle</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When a page request is sent to the Web
  server, whether through a submission
  or location change, the page is run
  through a series of events during its
  creation and disposal. When we try to
  build ASP.NET pages and this execution
  cycle is not taken into account, we
  can cause a lot of headaches for
  ourselves. However, when used and
  manipulated correctly, a page's
  execution cycle can be an effective
  and powerful tool. Many developers are
  realizing that understanding what
  happens and when it happens is crucial
  to effectively writing ASP.NET pages
  or user controls. So let's examine in
  detail the ten events of an ASP.NET
  page, from creation to disposal. We
  will also see how to tap into these
  events to implant our own custom code.</p>

<p>The fact that the LINQ to SQL designer interprets a <code>varchar(1)</code> as a <code>System.Char</code> is foolish considering that this is valid T-SQL:</p>

"<p>What is the difference between a <code>DateTime?</code> and a <code>DateTime</code> (without a question mark) in C#?</p>
","34211","","<p>A question mark after a value type is a shorthand notation for the <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/b3h38hb0.aspx""><code>Nullable&lt;T&gt;</code></a> structure.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Represents an object whose underlying
  type is a value type that can also be
  assigned null like a reference type.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <code>Nullable&lt;T&gt;</code> structure allows you to wrap value types (like <code>DateTime</code>, <code>Int32</code>, <code>Guid</code>, etc.) and treat them like reference types in certain respects.  It does get a bit more complicated (in terms of assignment, lifted operators, and other things) and as such I would recommend that you read <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/1t3y8s4s%28VS.80%29.aspx"">Nullable Types (C# Programming Guide)</a> and its related articles.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nullable types are instances of the
  <code>System.Nullable</code> struct. A nullable
  type can represent the normal range of
  values for its underlying value type,
  plus an additional null value. For
  example, a <code>Nullable&lt;Int32&gt;</code>, pronounced
  ""Nullable of Int32,"" can be assigned
  any value from -2147483648 to
  2147483647, or it can be assigned the
  null value. A <code>Nullable&lt;bool&gt;</code> can be
  assigned the values true or false, or
  null. The ability to assign null to
  numeric and Boolean types is
  particularly useful when dealing with
  databases and other data types
  containing elements that may not be
  assigned a value. For example, a
  Boolean field in a database can store
  the values true or false, or it may be
  undefined.</p>

<p>That being said, however, this is not the case here.  By arbitrarily rounding the number at a given point you are assuming that the type will also round at that same point which is not how it works.

"<p>I'm using LinqToSQL, creating my entities with the designer in studio which nicely creates the designer class with all corresponding entity-classes. Normally when I wanted some custom stuff added to my entities, I would create a partial class and do the custom stuff there.
Here's my problem; the new ASP.NET MVC 2 (preview) contains some nice Data Annotation Validation support, which allows you to do something like:</p>

<pre><code>public class Customer 
{
    [Required(ErrorMessage = ""Name is Required"")]
    public string Name { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Can anybody advise me how to handle this? I was hoping not to create an extra class and do some sort of mapping.. :( And it would be nice to keep the validation of my entities in my entities :)</p>

<p>I hope I'm making some sense here.. thanks in advance.</p>
","34211","","<p>Everyone has a different opinion but I am the kind of guy who goes ahead and edits generated files.  If I can add a partial class then I will but for cases like this I would go ahead and edit the property in the generated file.</p>

<p>A lot of generated files should be treated as a scaffold that is yours once the generator has spit it out.  Once you start thinking about it that way some things can become a lot easier.  By the way I <em>wouldn't</em> advocate this approach for a file that is going to be regenerated often as that would create many more headaches.</p>
"
"<p>I would like to know what is the best pattern when returning objects from custom collection classes. To illustrate my problem, here is an example:</p>

<p>I have a Customer class:</p>

<pre><code>public class Customer
{
   //properties
   //methods
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then I have a customer collection class:</p>

<pre><code>public class Customercollection: Collection&lt;Customer&gt;
{

  public Collection&lt;Customer&gt; FindCustomers()
   {
     //calls DAL and gets a Collection of customers
     Collection&lt;Customer&gt; customers = DAL.GetCustomers();

     return customers;
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, an alternative version of this method can be:</p>

<pre><code>public class Customercollection: Collection&lt;Customer&gt;
{

  public Collection&lt;Customer&gt; FindCustomers()
   {
     //calls DAL and gets a Collection of customers
     Collection&lt;Customer&gt; customers = DAL.GetCustomers();
     foreach(Customer c in customers)
     this.Add(c);
     return this;
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I would like to discuss Which one is the better approach? And is there any other approach better than two above two?</p>
","34211","","<p>I would propose a third approach:</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> <em>I have updated this code example to reflect the OP's comments below.</em></p>

<pre><code>public class Customer
{
    public static ICollection&lt;Customer&gt; FindCustomers()
    {
    	Collection&lt;Customer&gt; customers = new Collection&lt;Customer&gt;();

    	foreach (CustomerDTO dto in DAL.GetCustomers())
    		customers.Add(new Customer(dto));  // Do what you need to to create the customer

    	return customers;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Most of the time a custom collection is not needed - I am assuming that this is one of those cases.  Also you can add utility methods onto the type (in this case, the <code>Customer</code> type) as this aids developer discovery of these methods.  (This point is more a matter of taste - since this is a static method you are free to put it in whatever type you wish <code>CustomerUtility</code> or <code>CustomerHelper</code> for example).</p>

<p>My final suggestion is to return an interface type from <code>FindCustomers()</code> to give you greater flexibility in the future for implementation changes.  Obviously <code>DAL.GetCustomers()</code> would have to return some type that implemented <code>IList&lt;T&gt;</code> as well but then any API method (especially in a different tier like a data layer) should be returning interface types as well.</p>

"<p>I have a page and a user control &mdash; we'll call them Detail.aspx and Selector.ascx.</p>

<p>Let's say the page shows the details of individual records in a database.  The user control basically consists of a DropDownList control and some associated HTML.  The DropDownList displays a list of other records to switch to at any time.</p>

<p>When the DropDownList fires its SelectedIndexChanged event, I'd like the parent page, Detail.aspx in this case, to handle it.  After all, he'll need to know what was selected so that he can appropriately change the URL and the details shown, etc.</p>

<p>To do that, I've done what I usually do, which is also what the top answer says to do in <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/943171/expose-and-raise-event-of-a-child-control-in-a-usercontrol-in-c"">this StackOverflow question</a>:</p>

<pre><code>public event EventHandler DropDownSelectedIndexChanged
{

    {

    }
    remove
    {
        MyDropDownList.SelectedIndexChanged -= value;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The above code appears in the Selector.ascx.cs codebehind file.</p>

<p>As a result, on Detail.aspx, I can use it like so:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;cc1:RecordSelector ID=""RecordSelector1"" runat=""server""
OnDropDownSelectedIndexChanged=""RecordSelector1_DropDownSelectedIndexChanged"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So far nothing fancy or surprising.</p>

<p>Here is my problem:</p>

<p><strong>This causes a <code>NullReferenceException</code> when the browser hits Detail.aspx.</strong></p>

<p>Debugging the problem shows that when the page is first hit, the public event I've shown above tries to add the event, but MyDropDownList is null, thus throwing the exception.  From what I can tell, the events are added (or attempted to be added) <em>before</em> the Selector user control's Load event fires and thus also before the DropDownList's Load event fires.</p>

<p>Curiously, if I omit the OnDropDownSelectedIndexChanged attribute from Detail.aspx and instead put the following in the Page_Load event in Detail.aspx.cs:</p>

<pre><code>protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    RecordSelector1.DropDownSelectedIndexChanged += new EventHandler(RecordSelector1_DropDownSelectedIndexChanged);
}
</code></pre>

<p>It works exactly as expected.  The events are attached and handled just fine.  No problems.</p>

<p>But this means several bad things:</p>

<ol>
<li>I have to remember not to use the designer to add said event onto my user control</li>
<li>I have to remember not to add the event via attributes when working in source view</li>
<li>Worst of all, as the control's author I need to make sure everybody else using my control knows 1 and 2</li>
</ol>

<p>So what am I doing wrong?  Every example I've seen thus far shows similar usage of exposing child controls' events through a user control.</p>
","34211","","<p>The reason this works:</p>

<pre><code>protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    RecordSelector1.DropDownSelectedIndexChanged 
        += new EventHandler(RecordSelector1_DropDownSelectedIndexChanged);
}
</code></pre>

<p>and this does not:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;cc1:RecordSelector ID=""RecordSelector1"" runat=""server""
OnDropDownSelectedIndexChanged=""RecordSelector1_DropDownSelectedIndexChanged"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>is because the first one adds the handler <em>after</em> the control has been initialized (via the page's <code>Init</code>).  The second example gets parsed much earlier and as such the page is attempting to add the handler before the control has initialized.</p>

<p>Due to the nature of the page's life cycle I think you may have to live with adding the event handler in the code-behind.  There will be no way to add the handler before the control is initialized because that control will always be <code>null</code> prior to initialization.</p>

 x error(s), y warning(s)</p>

<p>Examples of this patterns are:</p>

<pre>
 Compile complete -- 1 errors, 213 warnings

 6>Process_Math - 3 error(s), 1 warning(s)
 24>Process_Math - 1 error(s), 0 warning(s)
</pre>

<p>How can I write the algorithm that finds that pattern and extract x and y from the line?
Thanks

","34211","","<p>Here is a small example:</p>

<pre><code>using System;
using System.Text.RegularExpressions;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
    	String input = @""Compile complete -- 1 errors, 213 warnings

    			 6&gt;Process_Math - 3 error(s), 1 warning(s)
    			 24&gt;Process_Math - 1 error(s), 0 warning(s)"";

    	Regex regex = new Regex(@""(\d+)\serrors?,\s(\d+)\swarnings?"",
    		RegexOptions.Compiled |
    		RegexOptions.CultureInvariant |

"<p>I learned Java while ago. I just got bored of Java and returned to C++ after a while. I thought that C# was similar to Java. My assumption about the similarities between C# and Java was not correct after some reading about C#. I found many powerful concepts in C# that I love to see in Java. Anyway, much of what I read made sense to me except one thing. I keep hearing that C# is component oriented language! Wikipedia was really useless about this concept.</p>

<p>What does it mean in simple terms when you say, C# is component oriented language?! A simple example would be appreciated.</p>
","34211","","<p>I feel that the line between ""component-oriented"" and ""object-oriented"" is very blurry and in most cases it is safe to assume that they are the same thing.</p>

<p>That being said (and given the fact that I am unaware of your knowledge about object-oriented programming) I submit <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object%5Foriented"">this excellent Wikipedia article</a> for you to read:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a
  programming paradigm that uses
  ""objects"" – data structures consisting
  of datafields and methods – and their
  interactions to design applications
  and computer programs. Programming
  techniques may include features such
  as information hiding, data
  abstraction, encapsulation,
  modularity, polymorphism, and
  inheritance. It was not commonly used
  in mainstream software application
  development until the early 1990s.
  Many modern programming languages now
  support OOP.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You may also want to read <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component-based%5Fsoftware%5Fengineering"">Component-based software engineering</a> which applies similar concepts across an entire system:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Component-based software engineering
  (CBSE) (also known as component-based
  development (CBD)) is a branch of
  software engineering, the priority of
  which is the separation of concerns in
  respect of the wide-ranging
  functionality available throughout a
  given software system. This practice
  brings about an equally wide-ranging
  degree of benefits in both the
  short-term and the long-term for the
  software itself and the organisation
  that sponsors it.</p>
  
  <p>Components are considered to be part
  of the starting platform for service
  orientation throughout software
  engineering, for example Web Services,
  and more recently, Service-Oriented
  Architecture (SOA) - whereby a
  component is converted into a service
  and subsequently inherits further
  characteristics beyond that of an
  ordinary component.</p>

"<p>I just wonder if using a folder called ""Controls"" in the root of either a Web Site Project (yuck) or a WAP project will cause any name collisions in asp.net.</p>

<p>Anyone experience a problem using this particular name for a folder?</p>
","34211","","<p>Have you tried it yet?  You will not create any naming collisions unless your <em>namespaces</em> collide with types from another assembly.  There is nothing stopping you from calling the folder ""Controls"" and placing types in the folder in a separate namespace (don't do this though as it is confusing).</p>

<p>And no, in my experience I have yet to see any naming collisions between my types and any other types in other assemblies.  Give your projects good default namespaces and you shouldn't have any issues with extending that namespace and collisions.</p>

<p>Also, this might be of interest to you: <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms229026.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">.NET Framework Developer's Guide : Names of Namespaces</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The name chosen for a namespace should
  indicate the functionality made
  available by types in the namespace.
  For example, the System.Net.Sockets
  namespace contains types that enable
  developers to use sockets to
  communicate over networks.</p>
  
  <p>The general format for a namespace
  name is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Company&gt;.(&lt;Product&gt;|&lt;Technology&gt;)[.&lt;Feature&gt;][.&lt;Subnamespace&gt;]
</code></pre>
  
  <p>For example,</p>

<pre><code>Microsoft.WindowsMobile.DirectX.

<p>Objects that are expensive to instantiate yet relatively static (that is unchanging) throughout the application's life ought to be cached.  Even relatively inexpensive objects should be cached if you can improve performance by doing so.</p>

"<p>I am using xsd.exe to generate some c# classes from a .xsd file. I ran into the same issue that is covered here and on other sites where xsd.exe generates Type[] arrays instead of generic List collections for  types in the .xsd file. Some people have suggested that svcutil.exe can be used as a replacement for xsd.exe if you pass the /dataContractOnly parameter to svcutil.exe.

"<p>I have a product which has around 10+ assemblies. We used to ship it without strongly naming the assemblies. But after reading about strong naming, I guess it is a wise idea to strong name assemblies. Just wanted to know is that a best practice to strong name all assemblies used by a program?</p>

<p>Any thoughts?</p>
","34211","","<p>Yes, it is a best practice and you really ought to do it especially considering the fact that you are shipping this code to customers (I consider strong-naming to be less critical in an internal or web-based application).</p>

<p>For an explanation of this rationale please see  <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/wd40t7ad.aspx"">Strong-Named Assemblies</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A strong name consists of the
  assembly's identity—its simple text
  name, version number, and culture
  information (if provided)—plus a
  public key and a digital signature. It
  is generated from an assembly file
  (the file that contains the assembly
  manifest, which in turn contains the
  names and hashes of all the files that
  make up the assembly), using the
  corresponding private key. Microsoft®
  Visual Studio® .NET and other
  development tools provided in the
  Windows Software Development Kit (SDK)
  can assign strong names to an
  assembly. Assemblies with the same
  strong name are expected to be
  identical.</p>
  
  <p>You can ensure that a name is globally
  unique by signing an assembly with a
  strong name. In particular, strong
  names satisfy the following
  requirements:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><p>Strong names guarantee name uniqueness
  by relying on unique key pairs. No one
  can generate the same assembly name
  that you can, because an assembly
  generated with one private key has a
  different name than an assembly
  generated with another private key.</p></li>
  <li><p>Strong names protect the version
  lineage of an assembly. A strong name
  can ensure that no one can produce a
  subsequent version of your assembly.
  Users can be sure that a version of
  the assembly they are loading comes
  from the same publisher that created
  the version the application was built
  with.</p></li>
  <li><p>Strong names provide a strong
  integrity check. Passing the .NET
  Framework security checks guarantees
  that the contents of the assembly have
  not been changed since it was built.
  Note, however, that strong names in
  and of themselves do not imply a level
  of trust like that provided, for
  example, by a digital signature and
  supporting certificate.</p></li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>When you reference a strong-named
  assembly, you expect to get certain
  benefits, such as versioning and
  naming protection. If the strong-named
  assembly then references an assembly
  with a simple name, which does not
  have these benefits, you lose the
  benefits you would derive from using a
  strong-named assembly and revert to
  DLL conflicts. Therefore, strong-named
  assemblies can only reference other
  strong-named assemblies.</p>

"<p>Between handling the Page_Init event or overriding the OnInit method of a Page, which one is better to use? Thanks. </p>

<p>How could the JIT know how many times a particular method would be called?  Wouldn't the frequency of interpretation factor into the decision?  </p>

<p>I would also question how well a JIT compiler would be able to analyze a function to determine whether or not interpretation would be best without interpreting the function itself.

<p>When calling a function you need to specify the function name and then the arguments to that function in parenthesis immediately following the function name.  If the function you want to use does not accept a variable number of arguments (like <code>strlen</code> for instance) you must call the function multiple times, once for each variable you have.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>  You cannot pass null to a method that expects a <code>ref</code> argument.  A <code>ref</code> argument needs a reference, try something like this:</p>

  using (MemoryStream memoryStream = new MemoryStream())

"<p>I have a key/value pairs mapped by hash (ID) in <code>Dictionary&lt;string, Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt;&gt;</code> called id2key_value. You can think of this as a way to represent database-like table with rows.</p>

<p>I added some helper functions to ease the use of some basic datatypes by doing a cast, like</p>

<pre><code>public int GetInt(string id, string key)
{
    int value = 0;
    bool success = int.TryParse(map[id][key], out value);

    if (success)
        return value;
    else
        throw new InvalidOperationException(
            ""Trying to obtain a non-integer value with GetInt()."");
}
</code></pre>

<p>Well, I thought I was being clever when I came up with an idea of a ""cast-cache"", which basically holds already parsed objects, so I could skip the parsing of the string for int, bool, DateTime, etc., and simply cast them to appropriate datatype from the cache. Like,</p>

<pre><code>public int GetInt(string id, string key)
{
    if (cast_cache.ContainsKey(id) &amp;&amp; cast_cache[id].ContainsKey(key))
        return (int) cast_cache[id][key];

    int value = 0;
    bool success = int.TryParse(map[id][key], out value);

    if (success)
    {
        this.AddToCache(id, key, value);

        return value;
    }
    else
        throw new InvalidOperationException(
            ""Trying to obtain a non-integer value with GetInt()."");
}
</code></pre>

<p>The ""cast-cache"" is simply <code>Dictionary&lt;string, Dictionary&lt;string, object&gt;&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>So, I did some performance testing with 10000 ints added to the map. Then I did one million random retrieves, with and without ""cast-caching"".</p>

<p>It took 495(ms) without caching and 490(ms) with caching. I also ran a test with DateTime, there the difference was more significant, but less than I expect (~750(ms) non-cached vs ~500(ms) cached).</p>

<p>Not (obviously) understanding the principle of a cast, how costly this operation is and why the performance is so close to the one that ""deserializes"" from string?</p>
","34211","","<p>Casting is much faster that most people seem to think since you are not touching the object itself (you are simply changing the reference that points to that object).</p>

<p>One of the main reasons that you ought to avoid casting is that when you cast you are eschewing type-safety and introducing potential execution-time errors into your application.  I would rarely consider casting to be a performance concern.  </p>

<p>As a side note I would make sure that you test both reference types and value types in your cache to make sure that you are not incurring a performance penalty due to the boxing and unboxing of any value types.</p>

<p>The performance penalty of boxing comes from the fact that casting a value type to an object <em>does</em> involve more than changing a reference as the value type must be copied to the heap.  Also the use of a boxed value type will unbox the reference type and subsequently copy those values from the heap to the stack again.</p>

","34211","","<p>ASP.NET is a web framework - in other words it is simply a set of libraries that make creating websites easier by abstracting away all the tedious details.

<p>This boils down to simply a <code>get_Item(Int32)</code> method in place of a <code>get_Item()</code> method that would normally be emitted by the compiler in place of a parameterless property.  As such this doesn't open up much opportunities for optimization.</p>

"<p>I have a third-party, closed source application that exports a COM interface, which I am using in my C#.NET application through Interop. This COM interface exports many objects that all show up as System.Object until I cast them to the appropriate interface type. I want to assign an property of all of these objects. Thus:</p>

<pre><code>foreach (object x in BigComInterface.Chickens)
{
    (x as Chicken).attribute = value;
}
foreach (object x in BigComInterface.Ducks)
{
    (x as Duck).attribute = value;
}
</code></pre>

<p>But assigning the property is likely (for application-specific reasons that are unavoidable) to throw Exceptions from which I want to recover, so I really want a try/catch around each one. Thus:</p>

<pre><code>foreach (object x in BigComInterface.Chickens)
{
    try
    {
        (x as Chicken).attribute = value;
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        // handle...
    }
}
foreach (object x in BigComInterface.Ducks)
{
    try
    {
        (x as Duck).attribute = value;
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        // handle...
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously, it would be so much cleaner to do this:</p>

<pre><code>foreach (object x in BigComInterface.Chickens)
{
    SetAttribute&lt;Chicken&gt;(x as Chicken, value);
}
foreach (object x in BigComInterface.Ducks)
{
    SetAttribute&lt;Duck&gt;(x as Duck, value);
}

void SetAttribute&lt;T&gt;(T x, System.Object value)
{
    try
    {
        x.attribute = value;
    }
    catch
    {
        // handle...
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>See the problem? My <em>x</em> value can be of any type, so the compiler can't resolve <em>.attribute</em>. Chicken and Duck are not in any kind of inheritance tree and they do not share an interface that has <em>.attribute</em>. If they did, I could put a constraint for that interface on <em>T</em>. But since the class is closed-source, that's not possible for me.</p>

<p>What I want, in my fantasy, is something like a constraint requiring the argument to <em>have the .attribute property</em> regardless of whether it implements a given interface. To wit,</p>

<pre><code>void SetAttribute&lt;T&gt;(T x, System.Object value) where T:hasproperty(attribute)
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not sure what to do from here other than to cut/paste this little try/catch block for each of Chicken, Duck, Cow, Sheep, and so on.</p>

<p>My question is: What is a good workaround for this problem of wanting to invoke a specific property on an object when the interface that implements that property cannot be known at compile time?</p>
","34211","","<p>Unfortunately the only way to do this is to constrain the type parameter with an interface that defines that property and is implemented on all types.  </p>

<p>Since you do not have the source  this will be impossible to implement and as such you will have to use some sort of workaround.  C# is statically typed and as such doesn't support the kind of duck-typing you want to use here.  The best thing coming soon (in C# 4) would be to type the object as <code>dynamic</code> and resolve the property calls at execution time (note that this approach would also not be generic as you cannot constrain a generic type parameter as <code>dynamic</code>).</p>

","34211","","<p>If you only want to load the listitems on the first load of the page then you will need to enable ViewState so that the control can serialize its state there and reload it when the page posts back.</p>

This setting will need to be <code>true</code> for ViewState to work.</p>

<p>If you don't want to use ViewState, simply remove the <code>if (!IsPostBack) { ... }</code> from around the code that adds the <code>ListItems</code> and the items will be recreated on each postback.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I apologize - I misread your question.  You are correct that the <em>attributes</em> do no survive postback as they are not serialized in ViewState.  You must re-add those attributes on each postback.</p>

","34211","","<p>The safest and shortest way is to create a private, static field of type <code>Object</code> that is only used for locking (think of it as a ""pad-lock"" object).  Use this and only this field to lock on as this prevent other types from locking up your code when then lock on the same type that you do.</p>

<p>If you lock on the type itself there is risk that another type will also decide to lock on your type and this could create deadlocks.</p>

        }
    }
}

<p>My questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Will the using-statement that operates on the <code>Disposable</code> struct, returned from <code>Test()</code> box the struct, or not?</li>
<li>How can I find the answer myself?</li>
</ul>

<p>To try to find out myself, I inspected the IL produced by the above code, and here's the IL for the <code>Main(...)</code> method:</p>

<pre><code>.method private hidebysig static void Main(string[] args) cil managed
{
    .entrypoint
    .maxstack 1
    .locals init (

    L_0016: ret 
    .try L_0006 to L_0008 finally handler L_0008 to L_0016
}
</code></pre>

<p>I suspect the call to the virtual method there, on <code>L_0010</code> will introduce a boxing operation, but the actual <code>box</code> instruction is not here.</p>

<p>The reason I'm asking is that a while ago, probably 1-2 years, I saw online an ""optimization"" of the using-statement someone commented on. The case was where the using-statement was used as syntax for a short-time lock on an object, where the lock was acquired in the method, and a struct was returned, which when disposed of, would release the lock, code like this:</p>

<pre><code>using (LockTheObject())
{
    // use the object
}
</code></pre>

<p>and the comment was that by changing the return type of the <code>LockTheObject</code> method from <code>IDisposable</code> to the actual struct used, boxing was avoided.</p>

<p>But I'm wondering if this is true, or still true.</p>

<p>Can anyone point me in the right direction? If, in order to see the box operation, I'll have to inspect the runtime assembly code, please show me an example of what to look for, I'm well versed in assembly code so that's not a problem, but nothing jumped out at me when I looked at that either.</p>
","34211","","<p>It appears as though any value type that gets put in a <code>using</code> statement will not be boxed.  This appears to be a C# optimization as boxing is only omitted when a value type that implements <code>IDisposable</code> is in a <code>using</code> statement, not in any other context.</p>

"<p>One of my co-workers is building a C# windows app that needs to grab a set of data and then row-by-row alter that data. If the system encounters a problem at any step in the process, it needs to roll back all of the changes.</p>

<p>The process he has created works well when dealing with smaller sets of data, but as soon as the number of rows get larger, it starts to puke.</p>

<p>The process of altering the data needs to happen in the windows app. What is the best way to handle large data changes atomically in a windows app?</p>

"<p>What caching mechanism should I use for a .Net web application?  Memcached seems to be the best for the LAMP stack and Linux in general, but I'm not so sure that it's the answer for a .Net web application running on Windows.  My requirements are that it be distributed and that it run on Windows.</p>
","34211","","<p>ASP.NET offers two caching strategies out of the box, application caching and page output caching. For more information please see <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms178597.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">ASP.NET Caching Overview</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Often an application can increase
  performance by storing in memory data
  that is accessed frequently and that
  requires significant processing time
  to create. For example, if your
  application processes large amounts of
  data using complex logic and then
  returns the data as a report accessed
  frequently by users, it is efficient
  to avoid recreating the report every
  time a user requests it. Similarly, if
  your application includes a page that
  processes complex data but that is
  updated only infrequently, it is
  inefficient for the server to recreate
  that page on every request.</p>
  
  <p>To help you increase application
  performance in these situations,
  ASP.NET provides caching using two
  basic caching mechanisms. The first is
  <strong>application caching</strong>, which allows you
  to cache data you generate, such as a
  DataSet or a custom report business
  object. The second is <strong>page output
  caching</strong>, which saves the output of
  page processing and reuses the output
  instead of re-processing the page when
  a user requests the page again.</p>

"<p>The Wikipedia  article about encapsulation states:</p>

<p>""Encapsulation also protects the integrity of the component, by preventing users from setting the internal data of the component into an invalid or inconsistent state""</p>

<p>I started a discussion about encapsulation on a forum, in which I asked whether you should always clone objects inside setters and/or getters as to preserve the above rule of encapsulation. I figured that, if you want to make sure the objects inside a main object aren't tampered with outside the main object, you should always clone it.</p>

<p>One discussant argued that you should make a distinction between aggregation and composition in this matter. Basically what I think he ment is this:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you want to return an object that is part of a composition (for instance, a Point of a Rectangle), clone it.</li>
<li>If you want to return an object that is part of aggregation (for instance, a User as part of a UserManager), just return it without breaking the reference.</li>
</ul>

<p>That made sense to me too. But now I'm a bit confused. And would like to have your opinions on the matter.</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, does encapulation always mandate cloning?</p>

<p>PS.: I program in PHP, where resource management might be a little more relevant, since it's a scripted language.</p>
","34211","","<p>No, encapsulation simply mandates the <em>ability</em> to control state by creating a single access point to that state.</p>

<p>For example if you had a field in a class that you wanted to encapsulate you could create a public method that would be the single access  point for getting the value that field contains.  Encapsulation is simply this process of creating a single access point around that field.  </p>

<p>If you wish to change <em>how</em> that field's value is returned (cloning, etc.) you are free to do so since you know that you control the single avenue to that field.</p>

"<p>I am reading Bill Wagner's book <em>Effective C#</em>.  In Item 32 he is advocating for developers to create smaller, more cohesive assemblies that can be reused more readily.  However, in that same item he says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>... Extra Security checks also are
  done across assembly boundaries.  All
  code from the same assembly
  same has the same level of trust (not
  necessarily the same access rights,
  but the same truth level).  The
  CLR performs some security checks
  whenever code flow crosses an assembly
  boundary.  The fewer times your
  program flow crosses assembly
  boundaries, the more efficient it will
  be... None of these performance
  concerns should dissuade you from
  breaking up assemblies that are too
  large.  The performance penalties are
  minor.</p>

<p>My question is are there extra security checks performed for every method call into Foo.dll, or only the first time the assembly is loaded?</p>

","34211","","<p>Those security checks are done when the CLR loads the assembly. Once the assembly has been loaded, no further security checks are needed.</p>

<p>EDIT: 
Decided to throw a bunch of more context in to help focus on a specific answer.</p>

<p>Issues brought up
Q: Is this the only background thread currently running?
A: No. There is in fact a few backgroundworker threads as well as a thread which queues up multiple threads using the .NET Threadpool class. Therefore the sleep was originally placed into the code for the thought of allowing a context switch to occur for these other threads.
However I am lead to believe that anyways the OS is time sliced so that I'm sure without the sleep the other threads will get a chance to execute?</p>

<p>Q: Is this background worker constantly running?
A: The application provides an interface to interact with the desktop with a toggle button to display the background image.
Therefore the backgroundworker can essentially be off or constantly churning if the button is toggled.</p>

<p>I hope the overall question doesn't seem overall unimportant to performance. I am trying to find a good balance between performance and usability.</p>

","34211","","<p>The <code>using</code> statement may hurt performance in the sense that it will take longer to run but this shouldn't be your concern in cases like this.

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/209160/nullable-type-as-a-generic-parameter-possible"">This question</a> poses a similar problem, but in my case the values are already nullables and I just want to write out the value if it has one and spaces if it doesn't.</p>
","34211","","<p>Try something like this:</p>

    if (!value.HasValue) strVal = null;
    else strVal = value.HasValue.ToString();
    FixedWrite(writer, strVal, length);

"<p>I have a very simple linq to sql query in C#:</p>

<pre><code>int acctNum = 12345;                    

var query = from p in db.table
            where p.ACCT_NO == acctNum
            select p;

<p>This generates the following SQL:</p>

<pre><code>exec sp_executesql N'SELECT [t0].field1, [t0].field2, [t0].ACCT_NO
FROM [dbo].[table] AS [t0]
WHERE [t0].[ACCT_NO] = @p0', N'@p0 decimal(29,0)', @p0 = 12345
</code></pre>

<p>For some reason, this is taking an incredibly long time to run (several minutes).  If I run an equivalent query in management studio (select * from table where acct_no = 12345), it takes less than a second on a very large table (~7MM rows).  After some digging with the SQL profiler, I found that linq is passing the acctNum parameter as a Decimal(29,0) while the field is stored in the database as a Numeric(18,0).  If I take the generated SQL and just change the parameter type from decimal to numeric, it runs in less than a second.  In the profiler, I can see that the linq version uses almost 2 million reads versus about 400 for the numeric parameter query.  How can I force linq to pass this parameter as numeric instead of decimal?</p>
","34211","","<p>Most likely the problem lies with the type of <code>p.ACCT_NO</code> (in other words it was probably generated as a floating-point numeric type).  Make sure that this property is also typed as an <code>int</code> and it should work.</p>

"<p>I have used the <code>using</code> statement in both C# and VB.  I agree with all the critics regarding nesting using statements (C# seems well done, VB not so much)</p>

<p>So with that in mind I was interested in improving my VB using statements by ""using"" more than one system resource within the same block:</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>Please note that there needs to be much more error checking than this example provides.  I would specifically add checking around the parsing of the datetime (perhaps by using a function that wraps <code>DateTime.TryParseExact</code>).</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> If you want to use an <code>XDocument</code> instead of an <code>XElement</code> you will need to make a subtle change to the query (notice the usage of the <code>Descendants</code> method instead of the <code>Elements</code> method):</p>

<p>Remember that you don't need to use an <code>XDocument</code> unless you are working with the XML as a true document.  In most cases, the <code>XElement</code> type is sufficient.</p>

<p><strong>Edit #2:</strong> If you want to load the <code>XDocument</code> from disk then use this approach:</p>

","34211","","<p>If the methods don't access any of the type's state then they should be static.  </p>

<p>Static method calls provide a performance gain over instance methods and the presence of a static method tells future readers of your code that calling this method will create no side effects in the the state of the current instance of the type.</p>

<p>The performance gain of a static method comes from the fact that the compiler does not have to emit <code>callvirt</code> instructions to call a static method.  The <code>callvirt</code> instruction is handy for instance calls in that it does a <code>null</code> check prior to calling the method.  However, when you call a static methods there is no need to check for <code>null</code> so the compiler is free to emit the faster <code>call</code> instruction which doesn't check for <code>null</code>.</p>

"<p>In an OO component, when you have only one implementation available for an class and that class is not 'published' to other components, is it still advisable to have an interface and work with the interface instead? </p>

<p>I am fully aware of 'programming to an interface' design principle and also use it extensively. </p>

<p>Lately, I have been observing that most of the time a different implementation (although possible and would make sense) is never needed. As a result of always working with interfaces, the application code would have a fair amount of interfaces with just one implementation for each and the interface seems sort of an overhead.</p>

<p>Instead, is it preferable to just work with the concrete class and introduce the interface only when a second implementation is needed? Anyway, nowadays extracting an interface using IDEs is a breeze. And when the new interface is introduced, references to the old concrete class can be changed to use the new interface instead. </p>

<p>What do you think?</p>
","34211","","<p>Creating interfaces for concrete types is a delicate balancing act as you can easily create an interface explosion that provides no benefit and only complicates the domain space with redundant types.</p>

<p>My rule of thumb is to only create interfaces for types that are part of a public-facing API.  All types that are dedicated to the implementation of the API and are never exposed from the API don't need an interface.</p>

<p><code>System.Decimal</code> is capable of representing large floating point numbers with a significantly reduced risk of incurring any rounding errors like the one you are seeing.  <code>System.Single</code> and  <code>System.Double</code> are not capable of this and will round these numbers off and create issues like the one you are seeing in your example.</p>

<p><code>System.Decimal</code> uses a scaling factor to hold the position of the decimal place thus allowing for exact representation of the given floating-point number, whereas <code>System.Single</code> and  <code>System.Double</code> only approximate your value as best they can.</p>

  <p>Remember that a floating-point number

  accurately that number approximates a

  precision, although a maximum of 17
  digits is maintained internally. The
  precision of a floating-point number
  has several consequences:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><p>Two floating-point numbers that appear equal for a particular
  precision might not compare equal
  because their least significant digits
  are different.</p></li>
  <li><p>A mathematical or comparison operation that uses a floating-point

"<p>I have used Dictionary(TKey, TValue) for many purposes. But I haven't encountered any scenario to implement GetHashCode() which I believe is because my keys were of primary types like int and string.
I am curious to know the scenarios (real world examples) when one should use a custom object for key and thus implement methods GetHashCode() Equals() etc.</p>

<p>And, does using a custom object for key necessitate implementing these functions?</p>
","34211","","<p>One example is when you need to create a composite key (that is a key comprised of more that one piece of data).  That composite key would be a custom type that would need to override those methods.</p>

<p>For example, let's say that you had an in-memory cache of address records and you wanted to check to see if an address was in cache to save an expensive trip to the database to retrieve it.  Let's also say that addresses are unique in terms of their <em>street 1</em> and <em>zip code</em> fields.  You would implement your cache with something like this:</p>

<pre><code>class AddressCacheKey
{
    public String StreetOne { get; set; }
    public String ZipCode { get; set; }

    // overrides for Equals and GetHashCode
}
</code></pre>

<p>and </p>

<pre><code>static Dictionary&lt;AddressCacheKey,Address&gt; cache;
</code></pre>

<p>Since your <code>AddressCacheKey</code> type overrides the <code>Equals</code> and <code>GetHashCode</code> methods they would be a good candidate for a key in the dictionary and you would be able to determine whether or not you needed to take a trip to the database to retrieve a record based on more than one piece of data.</p>

<p>In code for business entities that we generate using CodeSmith we now have <code>[DebuggerNonUserCode]</code> attributes, so they don't count in code coverage results.

<p>Is there a way to get <code>[DebuggerNonUserCode]</code> attributes on these methods so we could get rid of the name-mangled anonymous method names from our generated code from our code coverage results? Or do we need to rewrite that generated code to no longer use anonymous methods?</p>

<p>Putting the <code>[DebuggerNonUserCode]</code> on the <code>method</code> parameter of the <code>SafeCall</code> method definition (before the <code>ReturnSomething&lt;T&gt;</code> parameter type) does not compile and maybe would not do exactly what we would like if it would.

new foo().second(""hello"").first(""world"");
new foo().first(""hello"").first(""world"");

<p>A good way to think about fluent interfaces is that they flow easier and are arguably easier to read.  The example above is simply a replacement for this more conventional usage:</p>

<pre><code>f = new foo();
f.first(""hello"");
f.second(""world"");
</code></pre>

<p>This means that a fluent interface does not dictate any of the implementation of the class beyond mandating that you return <code>this</code> so that method calls can be chained. This means that you can add fields to this class that can be used in any function, just like any other class.</p>

There are times where there will be too much information, and I will run out of memory.  I have a solution for avoiding the memory allocation problem, but I only want to use it when necessary, to avoid paging, which will ultimately decrease my performance when it's not necessary.  Is there a way to figure out how much memory I am occupying, so that I can page my information only when necessary?</p>

  <p>I got a moral question from an author
  of programming language textbooks the
  other day requesting my opinions on
  whether or not beginner programmers
  should be taught how to use arrays.</p>
  
  <p>Rather than actually answer that
  question, I gave him a long list of my
  opinions about arrays, how I use
  arrays, how we expect arrays to be
  used in the future, and so on. This
  gets a bit long, but like Pascal, I
  didn't have time to make it shorter. </p>
  
  <p>Let me start by saying when you
  definitely should not use arrays, and
  then wax more philosophical about the
  future of modern programming and the
  role of the array in the coming world.</p>

"<p>XML/XSL newbie here, so please forgive my ignorance. This is the xml input given to me:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;entry&gt;
    &lt;desc&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Lorem ipsum &lt;a href=""http://www.google.com""&gt;dolor&lt;/a&gt; sit amet.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Lorem &lt;strong&gt;ipsum&lt;/strong&gt; dolor sit amet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/desc&gt;
&lt;/entry&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I must write an XSL to get this result:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;Lorem ipsum &lt;a href=""http://www.google.com""&gt;dolor&lt;/a&gt; sit amet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lorem &lt;strong&gt;ipsum&lt;/strong&gt; dolor sit amet.&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I thought this would work, in an entry template:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;xsl:value-of select=""desc""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>but instead this is the output of the above line:</p>

<pre><code>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.
</code></pre>

<p>Am I correct in assuming there must be other xsl stylesheets on my system that do that? In any case, I have neither read not edit access to them, I can only add a new stylesheet, so to fix this I used this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;xsl:for-each select=""desc/*""&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;xsl:value-of select="".""/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/xsl:for-each&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This gets me, at least:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>However as you can see links and formatting have gone bye bye! I have no control on the kind of html elements that get added in there. Can anybody suggest a way to preserving the formatting and all of the desc element? The engine is XSL 1 only. Thanks in advance!</p>

"<p>I generally agree that major versions of a program should be <code>1.0</code>, <code>2.0</code>, ... and significant updates should be: <code>1.1</code>, <code>1.2</code>, ..., and that bug fixes should be at the third level: <code>1.0.1</code>, <code>1.0.2</code>, ... <code>1.0.156</code> (if you've been plagued by that many bug-fix releases between versions).</p>

<p><hr></p>

<p>But now I want to release my first Beta that will be one of a series of Betas leading towards the release of version <code>1.0</code>.</p>

<p>Specifically, it doesn't make sense to me, to number my Beta releases greater than the number I am developing to, e.g. <code>1.0.1</code> up to <code>1.0.15</code> (if I have 15 beta releases) and then follow it with <code>1.0</code>.</p>

<p>But using numbers less than <code>1.0</code> seems awkward, e.g. <code>0.9.1</code> ... <code>0.9.15</code> and will cause confusion if I start using <code>1.9.1</code> ... <code>1.9.15</code> as the Betas for version <code>2.0</code>.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>It depends on the type - if a reference type then yes, if a value type no.  This is also why you should never, ever lock on a value type since the value type will be boxed and any subsequent attempts to lock on that value will actually acquire a lock on a different object.</p>

<p>Yes, you should lock before any operation that mutates the state of the object.</p>

The method in question is the GetInvoiceAmount.  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated</p>

","34211","","<p>Are you looking for something like this?</p>

<pre><code>public Decimal GetInvoiceAmount()
{
    return this.Price * this.Quantity;    
}
</code></pre>

<p>Your current <code>GetInvoiceAmount</code> implementation sets the public field <code>invoiceAmount</code> so to use the current method you would need to do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>yourInstance.GetInvoiceAmount();
Decimal amount = yourInstance.invoiceAmount;
</code></pre>

<p>which seems counter-intuitive since the method says that it is ""getting"" something.</p>

<p>For clarity's sake I would recommend that this be a property that is generated each time it is called (that is a property that has no backing field) like this:</p>

<pre><code>public Decimal InvoiceAmount
{
    get { return this.Price * this.Quantity; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can remove the <code>GetInvoiceAmount</code> method and the <code>invoiceAmount</code> field as well as they would no longer be needed.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>As others have mentioned you need to pass the right type to the <code>SetValue</code> function but your other reflection code is not quite right either.  You need to get the type of the class in question before you can query for its members.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> If I understand correctly you are trying to set a string value to any property via reflection.  In order to do this you will need to do some type inspection and type conversion.</p>

<p>Here is an example of what I mean:</p>

<pre><code>using System;
using System.Reflection;

class Test
{
    static void Main()
    {
    	Foo foo = new Foo();

    	PropertyInfo property = typeof(Foo).GetProperty(""Bar"");
    	Object value =
    		Convert.ChangeType(""1234"",
    			Nullable.GetUnderlyingType(property.PropertyType)
    			?? property.PropertyType);

    	property.SetValue(foo, value, null);
    }
}

class Foo
{
    public Nullable&lt;Int32&gt; Bar { get; set; }
}

"<p>Long story: I'm working on a system that will have <code>Tasks</code> and <code>Handlers</code>.  Tasks will be sent from disparate parts of the system to the Handlers, where they will eventually return a value.  </p>

<p>We've got a system in-place that is loosely-typed and has turned into something of a gnarled mess (the problem is significantly amplified by the fact that the task-initiators are often coming from third-party components that are essentially plug-ins).</p>

<p>I've been thinking of ways to implement the same in a strongly-typed fashion--and might just be taking this to the point of obsurdity--but am close to what I'd <em>like</em>.  The problem is some syntax.</p>

<p>Here's what I've got (generic names expanded for clarity):</p>

<pre><code>interface ITask&lt;ReturnType&gt; { }

interface ITaskHandler&lt;TaskType, TaskReturnType&gt; where TaskType : ITask&lt;TaskReturnType&gt;
{
    TaskReturnType PerformTask(TaskType task);
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, <code>ITask</code> is generic, and the declared generic parameter for <code>ITask</code> is the return-type for <code>ITaskHandler&lt;ITask&gt;</code>.  This means that each <code>TaskHandler</code> is contractually bound to return the type specified by its <code>ITask</code>.</p>

<p>The big downside that declaring TaskHandlers leads to some fairly ugly Signatures...</p>

<pre><code>class SpecificTask : ITask&lt;Dictionary&lt;Type,Delegate&gt;&gt;
{
}

class SpecificHandler : ITaskHandler&lt;SpecificTask, Dictionary&lt;Type, Delegate&gt;&gt;
{
    public Dictionary&lt;Type, Delegate&gt; PerformTask(SpecificTask task)
    {
        return new Dictionary&lt;Type, Delegate&gt;();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>My question is: since <code>SpecificTask</code> has already provided it's ReturnType as a generic parameter, can <code>SpecificHandler</code>'s signature be shortened to something more like:</p>

<pre><code>interface ITaskHandler&lt;TaskType&gt; where TaskType : ITask
{
    // pulling TaskReturnType out of thin air...
    TaskReturnType PerformTask(TaskType task);
}

class SpecificHandler : ITaskHandler&lt;SpecificTask&gt;
{
    public Dictionary&lt;Type, Delegate&gt; PerformTask(SpecificTask task)
    {
        return new Dictionary&lt;Type, Delegate&gt;();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>...and if so, how would I declare the return type of <code>PerformTask</code> when the type is contained within <code>SpecificTask</code>?</p>
","34211","","<p>Unfortunately you can't do what you want to do and retain static type checking.  All of the generic type parameters must be delared in order for the compiler to be able to statically know what goes where.  </p>

<p>You could do this with reflection but that would completely undermine the purpose of generics in the first place.</p>

"<p>I was wondering if there are any languages that allow for named tuples. Ie: an object with multiple variables of different type and configurable name.</p>

<p>Eg:</p>

<pre><code>public NamedTuple&lt;double:Speed, int:Distance&gt; CalculateStuff(int arg1, int arg2)

var result = CalculateStuffTuple(1,2);

Console.WriteLine(""Speed is: "" + result.Speed.ToString())
Console.WriteLine(""Distance is: "" + result.Distance.ToString())
</code></pre>

<p>I could conceive how a dynamic could support such a feature. The static languages I usually swim in (like c#) can do a Dictionary, but that's not type safe unless all items are of the same type. Or you can use a Tuple type, but that means you have fixed names of the members (Var1, Var2, etc). </p>

<p>You could also write a small custom class, but that's the situation I'd like to avoid.</p>

<p>I could imagine a macro processing language could script something like that up for you in a static language, but I don't know of such a language.</p>

","34211","","<p>I am not sure what you would need this for - a tuple is simply a structure that holds different types of data.  If you really want named properties you will have to create a custom type or create an anonymous type on the fly.</p>

"<p>Page_Load isn't a virtual method. What calls this method and how does it do it? Is it reflection or some other technique? Also how many events are handled this way?</p>

<p>Also is it preferable to handle things in an overloaded OnLoad or Page_Load? How are they different?</p>
","34211","","<p>ASP.NET has a feature called ""AutoEventWireup"" - this feature allows you to create methods that have the <code>EventHandler</code> signature with names like <code>Page_Load</code> and the runtime will wire up the event from the parent page to the method in your class.  Basically the runtime does this on your behalf:</p>

<pre><code>this.Load += this.Page_Load;
</code></pre>

<p>Now it is better to disable AutoEventWireup and either create these event handlers yourself in the pages <code>OnInit</code> method or simply override the parent page's <code>OnLoad</code> method.</p>

<p><strong>Edit (in response to the OP's comment below):</strong> This process doesn't cover button clicks and such but the process is similar. </p>

<p>In order for a method like <code>MyButton_Click</code> to work without you explicitly creating an event handler you would have to set the <code>OnClick</code> attribute on the control in the aspx file like this: </p>

<pre><code>&lt;asp:button

"<p>I have made myself an ExpressionBuilder class that helps me put together expressions that can be used as a predicate when doing Linq to Sql queries. It has worked great. However, I just discovered Expressions can only be used to filter on Tables, and not on EntitySets??Why on earth is this the case?</p>

<p>For example if I have Company and an Employee with a Salary. I could create these two expressions:</p>

<pre><code>Expression&lt;Func&lt;Company, bool&gt;&gt; cp = x =&gt; x.Name.StartsWith(""Micro"");
Expression&lt;Func&lt;Employee, bool&gt;&gt; ep = x =&gt; x.Name.StartsWith(""John"");

    .Select(x =&gt; new

            x.Name,

                .Sum(y =&gt; y.Salary),
        }
    .ToList();
</code></pre>

<p>Why is this the case? Am I missing something? I don't find this logical. Can I fix this somehow? Or do you have a good workaround?</p>

<p>I know that I in this case could just use <code>Where(x =&gt; x.Name.StartsWith(""John""))</code> instead, but the problem is that the expressions I need are not that trivial. They are longer strings of <code>AndAlso</code>s and <code>OrElse</code>s.</p>

<p><strong>3)</strong>
Once I get the click image to work I am hoping to send a X,Y coordinate to the server and change that corresponding spot on the board.  How would I determine what cell in the table is clicked in order to know what coordinates to use?  (or is there a much easier way?)</p>

","34211","","<p>C#'s garbage collection is non-deterministic but the language does provide a deterministic structure for resource disposal like this:</p>

<pre><code>using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(...))
{
    // ...  
}
</code></pre>

<p>This will create a <code>try/finally</code> block which will ensure that the connection object is disposed regardless of what happens in the method.  You really ought to wrap any instances of types that implement <code>IDisposable</code> in a using block like this as it will ensure responsibly resource management (of unmanaged resources like database connections) and also it gives you the deterministic control you are looking for.</p>

"<p>I have a class like below:</p>

<p>and I need to pass to a certain method a delegate like this:</p>

","34211","","<p>Unfortunately not, constructors are not quite the same things as methods and as such you cannot create a delegate that points to them.  This is an interesting idea though, perhaps with more information we could devise some sort of workaround that would be syntactically similar.</p>

"<p>I am learning ASP.NET MVC now a days and I have found that most of the examples in ASP.NET MVC are with ORM. I don't have any issue in using ORM for my learning and personal project. But at my work we have worked only with ASP.NET web forms and we use stored procedures only. We have data access layer (simple c# classes) as interface between asp.net code behind page and stored procedures. Now if we want to use ASP.NET MVC, will it be a bad idea to do it without an ORM. As most of the MVC frameworks like rails/django have built-in ORMs, is it any harm to use our own data access layer with ASP.NET MVC. I don't want to have any database related activity like datareader, datatable in my controllers. Is there any other better solution?</p>
","34211","","<p>If you have a DAL already built - use it!  Unless you were planning on moving from your existing DAL to an OR/M anyhow you won't find it beneficial to move to an OR/M for it's own sake.</p>

<p>One of the beautiful things about the MVC pattern is the is encourages a separation of concerns.  This means that you are reducing coupling in you application which makes your application's architecture flexible and modular.

"<p>I am relatively new to .net. As I was trying to grasp the concept of Garbage Collection(from ""CLR via C#""), I came to know how strong is the Garbage collection approach. But then as I read I understood that native resources allocated should be released. The methods are:<br>

"<p>I'm attempting to create a BitTorrent library in C# as a side project, for fun. However, I've run into a design issue that could create problems later on if I don't address it now.</p>

<p>I currently have a <code>PeerGreeter</code> class, which puts a <code>Socket</code> in a listening state for any peers that try to connect to me, to serve me files in the torrent. When a peer connects, the greeter exchanges handshakes, makes sure everything is valid, and then fires a <code>PeerConnected</code> event with the associated <code>Socket</code> and handshake information as handler arguments.</p>

<p>My <code>Torrent</code> class, which is a representation of a single torrent and all its duties, has two lists of all peers in the swarm (encapsulated in a <code>Peer</code> object), connected and disconnected. When the greeter fires the <code>PeerConnected</code> event, the <code>Torrent</code> instance finds the corresponding <code>Peer</code> in the disconnected list. If it finds one, it moves it to the connected list, and sets a <code>Connection</code> property of type <code>Socket</code> in its instance to the <code>Socket</code> created by the greeter. The property is an auto-property with the access modifiers as: <code>{ get; internal set; }</code></p>

<p>The problem I'm having is that this, as far as I know, isn't thread-safe. If one thread is working with a connection of a <code>Peer</code>, and then another thread modifies that connection object somehow, or disposes it, it could create issues. I've considered setting the <code>Connection</code> property's setter's access modifier to <code>private</code>, and having it set in the constructor, but the problem with that is that I need to create a new object to replace the placeholder <code>Peer</code> in the disconnected list to add it to the connected list.</p>

<p>My question is should I stick with having the setter as <code>internal</code>, or is making it <code>private</code> and replacing the placeholder with an entirely new instance a good approach as well?</p>
","34211","","<p>For thread-safety purposes, making the type as immutable as possible will save you many, many headaches.  Make the accessor private (or better yet, mark the field as <code>readonly</code>) and generate new instances when changes need to be made.</p>

  <p>While you might find it helpful to
  think of collections as being an
  abstraction of arrays, they have some
  special properties that collections do
  not. Arrays in the Java language are
  covariant -- which means that if
  Integer extends Number (which it
  does), then not only is an Integer
  also a Number, but an Integer[] is
  also a Number[], and you are free to
  pass or assign an Integer[] where a
  Number[] is called for. (More
  formally, if Number is a supertype of
  Integer, then Number[] is a supertype
  of Integer[].) You might think the
  same is true of generic types as well
  -- that List is a supertype of List, and that you can pass a
  List where a List is
  expected. Unfortunately, it doesn't
  work that way.</p>

"<p>Is there any way to override a non-virtual method? or something that gives similar results (other than creating a new method to call the desired method)?</p>

<p>I would like to override a method from <code>Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics.GraphicsDevice</code> with unit testing in mind.</p>
","34211","","<p>No, you cannot override a non-virtual method.  The closest thing you can do is hide the method by creating a <code>new</code> method with the same name but this is not advisable as it breaks good design principles.</p>

<p>But even hiding a method won't give you execution time polymorphic dispatch of method calls like a true virtual method call would.  Consider this example:</p>

<pre><code>using System;

class Example
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Foo f = new Foo();
        f.M();

        Foo b = new Bar();
        b.M();
    }
}

class Foo
{
    public void M()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(""Foo.M"");
    }
}

class Bar : Foo
{
    public new void M()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(""Bar.M"");
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>In this example both calls to the <code>M</code> method print <code>Foo.M</code>.  As you can see this approach does allow you to have a new implementation for a method as long as the reference to that object is of the correct derived type but hiding a base method <em>does</em> break polymorphism.  </p>

<p>I would recommend that you do not hide base methods in this manner.</p>

<p>I tend to side with those who favor C#'s default behavior that methods are non-virtual by default (as opposed to Java).  I would go even further and say that classes should also be sealed by default.  Inheritance is hard to design for properly and the fact that there is a method that is not marked to be virtual indicates that the author of that method never intended for the method to be overridden.</p>

<p><strong>Edit: ""execution time polymorphic dispatch""</strong>:</p>

<p>What I mean by this is the default behavior that happens at execution time when you call virtual methods.  Let's say for example that in my previous code example, rather than defining a non-virtual method, I did in fact define a virtual method and a true overridden method as well.</p>

<p>If I were to call <code>b.Foo</code> in that case, the CLR would correctly determine the type of object that the <code>b</code> reference points to as <code>Bar</code> and would dispatch the call to <code>M</code> appropriately.</p>

        }
</code></pre>
","34211","","<p>I don't really see any way to improve this code - why do you want to avoid <code>Activator</code>?</p>

<p>One option you could explore would be to create some sort of interface like this:</p>

<pre><code>interface IFoo
{

"<p>Hey guys, just starting out with C#. I had a few doubts, would really appreciate it if anyone could help me out here </p>

<h2>Question #1</h2>

<pre><code>animal dog;
dog = new animal();
</code></pre>

<p>what's the difference between the above two lines ?</p>

<p><hr></p>

<h2>Question #2</h2>

<pre><code>namespace proj1
{
   public class form1:form
      {
        guy bob;

      {
         initialize component();
         bob = new guy();
         bob.name = ""bob"";

       }
       }
</code></pre>

<p>When the Form1 class is instantiated, the Constructor form1() is the first thing to run.</p>

<p>But how can <strong>bob = new guy()</strong> be executed before <strong>Guy bob</strong> which is in the data member declaration of the class ??</p>
","34211","","<p><strong>Question 1:</strong></p>

<pre><code>animal dog;
dog = new animal();
</code></pre>

<p>In the first line of this example you are declaring a variable of type <code>animal</code>.  This means that this variable name and its type will be emitted by the C# compiler into the assembly as part of the IL for the stack of whatever method you are currently in.</p>

<p>The second line is the interesting part.  On the second line you are creating a new instance of the <code>animal</code> type and assigning the reference to that instance to the <code>dog</code> variable that you created on the previous line.  This code is also emitted to the assembly but this represents code that will run at execution time when this line is invoked. </p>

<p><strong>Question 2:</strong></p>

<pre><code>public class form1 : form
{
    guy bob;

    public form1()
    {
    	initialize component();
    	bob = new guy();
    	bob.name = ""bob"";
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This example is a bit more interesting because you are dealing with bigger concepts than in the first example.  In this example you have declared a <em>private field</em> in the class <code>form1</code> - this is handled differently than simply declaring a variable like in your first question.</p>

<p>A field is part of the state of the type you are currently in.  In other words, by declaring this variable in the scope of the current type you are indicating that this variable is a field and is therefore part of the blueprint of the type.  This means that this field is declared for all instances of this type.</p>

<p>This means that the declaration of <code>guy bob;</code> actually is defined far before you ever assign any references to the <code>bob</code> field.  It is actually defined at the time of compilation since the compiler will emit this field into the assembly as a field and the assembly's resulting metadata will reflect this field as well.  Since this field is defined at compilation time you can see why you are able to assign a reference to it because the code that assigns the reference to the field does not get executed until the code is run.</p>

"<p>Is there a C# equivalent to Java's <a href=""http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/CountDownLatch.html?is-external=true"">CountDownLatch</a>?</p>
","34211","","<p>Here is a simple implementation (from <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc163427.aspx#S1"">9 Reusable Parallel Data Structures and Algorithms</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To build a countdown latch, you just
  initialize its counter to n, and have
  each subservient task atomically
  decrement it by one when it finishes,
  for example by surrounding the
  decrement operation with a lock or
  with a call to Interlocked.Decrement.
  Then, instead of a take operation, a
  thread could decrement and wait for
  the counter to become zero; when
  awoken, it will know that n signals
  have been registered with the latch.
  Instead of spinning on this condition,
  as in while (count != 0), it’s usually
  a good idea to let the waiting thread
  block, in which case you then have to
  use an event.</p>

<pre><code>public class CountdownLatch {
    private int m_remain;
    private EventWaitHandle m_event;

    public CountdownLatch(int count) {
        m_remain = count;
        m_event = new ManualResetEvent(false);
    }

    public void Signal() {
        // The last thread to signal also sets the event.
        if (Interlocked.Decrement(ref m_remain) == 0)
            m_event.Set();
    }

    public void Wait() {
        m_event.WaitOne();
    }

"<p>I'm running my ASP.NET MVC app on an IIS6 host right now, and they're not willing to upgrade my server, nor move my site to an IIS7 server - unless I purchase a new account to transfer to.</p>

<p>Under IIS6 I understand there are a  lot of wildcard mappings happening to get the .net framework to process the incoming connections for each type. I'm assuming this incurs quite a bit of overhead...</p>

<p>Does ASP.NET MVC perform better under IIS7? I don't think it's super important for my site just yet, but as it grows I'll need to consider this.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>IIS 7.0 takes ASP.NET further by
  integrating the ASP.NET runtime
  extensibility model with the core
  server. This allows developers to
  fully extend the IIS 7.0 server with
  the richness of ASP.NET 2.0 and the
  .NET Framework, instead of using the
  lower level IIS C++ APIs. Existing
  ASP.NET applications also immediately
  benefit from tighter integration using
  existing ASP.NET features like Forms
  Authentication, Roles, and Output
  Caching for all content.</p>

"<p>Let's say I have a list A that needs to look exactly like list B. All the objects that B has but A does not have need to be added to A. And all the objects that A has but not B, need to be removed from A.</p>

<p>The reason why I need this is because I have an ArrayList of Players that I'm saving to a file. Every time I update an attribute of a Player, I save the changes to the file by calling a method that looks to the ArrayList of Players and saves it. This works because the ArrayList has the references to the Players.</p>

<p>However, whenever I search for a Player in the list, I first update the list by reading the file where its stored. This replaces all the references with whole new objects. After I do this, if I make a change to a previously fetched user and try to save it. The new instance of the Player gets saved instead of the one I made the changes in.</p>

<p>Would coming up with a good algorithm to make a list equal to another the solution? Or is there a better way to update an entire list while keeping references in use there?</p>

<p>UPDATE: Updated solution, runs in O(nlogm) time. Loops through each element in destination, searches for it in source. If it's found, removed from source. If not, removed from destination. Then add remaining elements in source to destination. List needs to be sorted of course, but the list that I get from the file will already be sorted because I sort as I add.</p>

<p>Since the .NET framework is designed to be used with strongly-typed languages, types are very important and most of the time we know what type we want and can request a conversion from some generic source (like a string or an object) to that specific type.  That is why we have casting, conversion methods (like <code>Convert.ToInt32</code> and such), and similar things.  They are all designed to allow us to directly state the output type of the conversion since we know what it is that we want to get.</p>

    	                ""Unable to retrieve a \""Parse\"" method for type."");

        return (Func&lt;String, T&gt;)Delegate
    	.CreateDelegate(typeof(Func&lt;String, T&gt;), methodInfo);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>It is a similar approach but think of it like a better <code>TryParse</code> method that returns a <code>Tuple&lt;Boolean, T?&gt;</code> (this requires .NET 4).  The first property of the tuple is a boolean value indicating the success or failure of the parsing attempt and the second property is a nullable value typed to the generic type argument that will be <code>null</code> if parsing fails and the value if parsing succeeds.</p>

<p>It works by using reflection to retrieve a static <code>Parse(String)</code> method from the generic type argument and invokes that method for the string that is passed in.  I built it as an extension method to allow you to do stuff like this:</p>

<pre><code>var intValue = ""1234"".TryParse&lt;Int32&gt;();
var doubleValue = ""1234"".TryParse&lt;Double&gt;();
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately this won't work on <code>enums</code> since they don't have the same signature for the parse method so you couldn't use this extension to parse an <code>enum</code> but it wouldn't be hard to hack this up to make a special case for enums.</p>

<p>One of the nice things about this approach is that the cost of retrieving the <code>Parse</code> method via reflection is only incurred on the first use since a static delegate is created for all subsequent uses.</p>

<p><hr></p>

<p>One more thing - the only thing that is clunky about this approach is that there is no language extensions or syntactic sugar that would make this easy to work with.  What I was hoping to achieve with this code was a <em>less</em> clunky way of using the standard <code>TryParse</code> methods that exist in the BCL.</p>

<p>I personally find this pattern rather ugly:</p>

<pre><code>Int32 value;
if (Int32.TryParse(someString, out value))
    // do something with value
</code></pre>

<p>mainly because it requires a variable declaration ahead of time and the use of an <code>out</code> parameter.  My approach above isn't really that much better:</p>

<pre><code>var result = someString.TryParse&lt;Int32&gt;();
if (result.Item1)
    // do something with result.Item2
</code></pre>

<p>What would be really cool would be to see a C# language extension that was built to work with a <code>Tuple&lt;Boolean, T?&gt;</code> that would allow us to work with this type smoothly but I get the feeling the more I write about this that it doesn't really seem that feasible.</p>

"<p>So i am working with a few CSS developers and every now and then we run into layout issues which have been fixed previously because one of the css developer did something which conflicted with something else.</p>

<p>We are already using SVN .. each CSS guy has his own css file he works with. So my question is what steps should be taken to minimize:</p>

<p>1 : layout conflicts</p>

<p>2 : increasing re-usability of previously written styles.</p>

<p>3 : minimize wasted time trying to merge the styles together in the final css.</p>

<p>Update:
I am not one of the CSS developer, i just take care of the backend stuff.. so please keep in mind that i am a total newbie when it comes to CSS norms.</p>
","34211","","<p>The best thing you can do is assign areas of responsibility - if you are all working in the same area of the site you are bound to have conflicting changes and will only create difficulties for yourselves because you will constantly be stepping on each other's toes.</p>

<p>Once you have established a common baseline for the styles of your site, divide the main areas of the site amongst you and only work in those areas.  When changes need to be made to the baseline, make them out in the open and communicate with your teammates about this change so that no one is surprised.</p>

<p>However, if the pointer is null for whatever reason, the function won't be called.</p>

<p>My question is, could it possibly be more beneficial to just not check for NULL? Obviously on safety critical systems this isn't an option, but your program crashing in a blaze of glory is more obvious than a function not being called if the program can still run without it. </p>

<p>In relation to the first question, do you always check for NULL before you use pointers?</p>

<p>Secondly, consider you have a function that takes a pointer as an argument, and you use this function multiple times on multiple pointers throughout your program. Do you find it more beneficial to test for NULL in the function (the benefit being you don't have to test for NULL all over the place), or on the pointer before calling the function (the benefit being no overhead from calling the function)?</p>
","34211","","<p>I prefer this style:</p>

<p>This means that whatever function this code lives in will fail quickly in the event that <code>p</code> is <code>NULL</code>.  You are correct that if <code>p</code> is <code>NULL</code> there is no way that <code>DoWhateverWithP</code> can execute but using a null pointer or simply not executing the function are both unacceptable ways to handle the fack the <code>p</code> is <code>NULL</code>.</p>

  <ul>
  <li>Create a thread-safe wrapper using the Synchronized method, and

  <li>If the class does not have a Synchronized method, derive from the
  class and implement a Synchronized
  method using the SyncRoot property.</li>

","34211","","<p>The <code>ref</code> keyword allows you to pass an argument by reference.

For value types this means that a reference to the variable holding the value of that type is passed.</p>

<p>This is used for methods that need to return more than one result but don't return a complex type to encapsulate those results.  It allows you to pass a reference to a object into the method so that the method can modify that object.</p>

<p>The important thing to remember is that reference types are not normally passed by reference, a copy of a reference is passed.  This means that you are not working with the actual reference that was passed to you.  When you use <code>ref</code> on a class instance you are passing the actual reference itself so all modifications to it (like setting it to <code>null</code> for example) will be applied to the original reference.</p>

Normally I would go with something like <code>hashmap_t</code> but now I need something else.</p>

<p>Is there any standard naming scheme for types in C? In other languages, using CapsCase like <code>Hashmap</code> is common, but a lot of C code I see doesn't use upper case at all. CapsCase works fairly nicely with a library prefix too, like <code>XYHashmap</code>.</p>

","34211","","<p>The <a href=""http://www.psgd.org/paul/docs/cstyle/cstyle11.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">Indian Hill style guidelines</a> have some suggestions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Individual projects will no doubt have
  their own naming conventions. There
  are some general rules however.</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><p>Names with leading and trailing underscores are reserved for system
  purposes and should not be used for
  any user-created names. Most systems
  use them for names that the user
  should not have to know. If you must
  have your own private identifiers,
  begin them with a letter or two
  identifying the package to which they
  belong.</p></li>
  <li><p><code>#define</code> constants should be in all CAPS.</p></li>
  <li><p>Enum constants are Capitalized or in all CAPS</p></li>
  <li><p>Function, typedef, and variable names, as well as struct, union, and
  enum tag names should be in lower
  case.</p></li>
  <li><p>Many macro ""functions"" are in all CAPS. Some macros (such as getchar and
  putchar) are in lower case since they
  may also exist as functions.
  Lower-case macro names are only
  acceptable if the macros behave like a
  function call, that is, they evaluate
  their parameters exactly once and do
  not assign values to named parameters.
  Sometimes it is impossible to write a
  macro that behaves like a function
  even though the arguments are
  evaluated exactly once.</p></li>
  <li><p>Avoid names that differ only in case, like foo and Foo. Similarly,
  avoid foobar and foo_bar. The
  potential for confusion is
  considerable.</p></li>
  <li><p>Similarly, avoid names that look like each other. On many terminals and
  printers, 'l', '1' and 'I' look quite
  similar. A variable named 'l' is
  particularly bad because it looks so
  much like the constant '1'.</p></li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>In general, global names (including
  enums) should have a common prefix
  identifying the module that they
  belong with. Globals may alternatively
  be grouped in a global structure.
  Typedeffed names often have ""_t""
  appended to their name.</p>
  
  <p>Avoid names that might conflict with
  various standard library names. Some
  systems will include more library code
  than you want. Also, your program may
  be extended someday.</p>

<p>by Jon Skeet and I just done understand how overload resolution gets done at compile time - How is that possible??  You dont know the type of the object till you run??</p>

<p>I always thought that all method calls were done at run time (late binding)</p>

<p>What are the exceptions to that??</p>

<p>I ll give an example: </p>

<pre><code>public void DoWork(IFoo)
public void DoWork(Bar) 

IFoo a = new Bar();
DoWork(a)
</code></pre>

<p>Which method gets called here and why?</p>
","34211","","<p>I think you are confusing overload resolution with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_method_table"" rel=""nofollow"">virtual method dispatch</a>.  Yes, the runtime type of the object will determine which method to run but the method has already been bound by the compiler.  This is a type-safe way of allowing polymorphic behavior without all the flexibility and danger of true late-binding.</p>

<p>The compiler will determine which method overload in to call based on the types of the arguments as written in your code.</p>
"
"<p>What should be more proper or what is recommended to use in VB.NET from either reflection vs. late binding:</p>

<pre><code>'Type can be various objects that have a common property for sure.'
Dim type = sender.GetType()
Dim prop = type.GetProperty(""Text"", 20)
Dim value = property.GetValue(sender, Nothing)
</code></pre>

<p>versus:</p>

<pre><code>Dim value = sender.Text
</code></pre>
","34211","","<p>Under the covers they are both doing the same thing (relatively speaking).  VB.NET's late-binding feature is done via assembly metadata queries at runtime which is exactly what reflection is all about.</p>

<p>One of the benefits to your first approach is that you have an opportunity to handle errors in a more finely-grained manner.</p>

"<p>In a base class object, I have an overridable subroutine that I would like all derived objects to have the ability to include.

","34211","","<p>Yes, this is perfectly acceptable.  A <code>MustOverride</code> member can often be too strict of a requirement for an inheriting class so if you want a virtual member without default implementation this is the proper thing to do.</p>

<p>Anyone who is inheriting from this class will appreciate the fact that you have defined a virtual member as a ""hook"" into your class like this. Also the fact that you have declared this method as <code>Protected</code> is also a good idea as public virtual members can be problematic from a maintenance standpoint.</p>

"<p>I have a question about binary serialization in C#</p>

<p>I need to be able to deep clone objects of class B (along with all it's subobjects in the graph of course). I'd like to implement this by using binary serialization. The discussion if that's the best method is irrelevant in the context of this question.</p>

<p>Say I have this class structure:</p>

<pre><code>public class A 
{
    private B objB;
}

[Serializable]
public class B : ICloneable
{
    private C objC1;
    private C objC2;

    public object Clone()
    {
        B clone = Helper.Clone&lt;B&gt;(this);
        return (B)clone;
    }
}

[Serializable]
public class C
{
    int a;
    int b;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The helper class for deep cloning with binary serialization (I got this method code from somewhere on the net, don't really remember where TBH, but it looks alright)</p>

<pre><code>public static class Helper
{
    public static T Clone&lt;T&gt;(T OriginalObject)
    {
        using (Stream objectStream = new MemoryStream())
        {
            IFormatter formatter = new BinaryFormatter();
            formatter.Serialize(objectStream, OriginalObject);
            objectStream.Seek(0, SeekOrigin.Begin);
            return (T)formatter.Deserialize(objectStream);
        }
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>So at some point in my app, I hit following code:</p>

<pre><code>B clone = (B)objA.objB.Clone();
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that the debugger moans about class A not being marked as Serializable.</p>

<p>But I don't want to serialize A, I want to serialize B and it's subobject C.</p>

<p>I guess it tries to serialize the parent object A too, because it's all interconnected in the object graph. But is there any way I can exclude it from being serialized at this point?</p>
","34211","","<p>There must be something else in play here - your code compiles and executes without issue (as it should - type <code>A</code> is not a part of type <code>B's</code> object graph).</p>

"<p>I'm working with c# .Net</p>

<p>I have a question,</p>

<p>I'm loading Xml file with <code>XDocument.xDoc.Load(file)</code>, but it fails because in my content I also have xml tags:</p>

<p>Example: <code>&lt;root&gt;&lt;abc&gt;&lt;deg&gt;&lt;/abc&gt;&lt;/root&gt;</code> </p>

<p>My problem is that the <code>Load</code> function treats the <code>&lt;deg&gt;</code> as an Xml tag without a matching ""<code>&lt;/deg&gt;</code>""...</p>

<p>My question is, how can i replace the ""&lt;"" and "">"" of the ""deg"" with the matching ""<code>&amp;lt;</code>""  ""<code>&amp;gt;</code>"" in the easiest way?</p>

<p>N.B. my file is very big and I have a lot of tags...</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","34211","","<p>If you can get at that section before you load it into the <code>XmlDocument</code> then you could use the <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.httputility.htmlencode.aspx"" rel=""nofollow""><code>HttpUtility.HtmlEncode</code></a> method to entity-escape the content for you.</p>

"<p>I am using LINQ to SQL</p>

<p>and want to add functions to autogenerated <code>EntitySet&lt; TEntity &gt;</code> collections.</p>

<p>eg.</p>

<pre><code>City.Houses
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>Houses</code> is automatically generated <code>EntitySet &lt; House &gt;</code></p>

<p>I am using extension method to add extract function to the <code>EntitySet &lt; House &gt;</code> class</p>

<p>so that I can get something like</p>

<pre><code>City.House.FindByID(id);
</code></pre>

<p>but now I also have</p>

<pre><code>City.Bunglows.FindByID(id);
</code></pre>

<p>now <code>FindByID</code> basically does the same thing for both these classes.</p>

<p>Will I have to extend <code>Bunglows</code> also and implement the same function again. Can't I do some kind of inhertiance on the autogenerated <code>EntitySet&lt; TEntity &gt;</code> classes??</p>

<p>But that will make FindByID() available on all EntitySet&lt; TEntity > classes. What if I want to implement that function on these 2 particular entity sets only???</p>

    (this EntitySet&lt;TEntity&gt; source, Int32 id)
{
    // ...
}

"<p>This is kinda theoretical question,

"<p>I've been thinking about whether it's possible to apply the DI pattern without incurring the cost of virtual method calls (which according to experiments I did can be up to 4 times slower than non-virtual calls). The first idea I had was to do dependency injection via generics:</p>

<pre><code>sealed class ComponentA&lt;TComponentB, TComponentC&gt; : IComponentA 
    where TComponentB : IComponentB
    where TComponentC : IComponentC
{ ... }
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately the CLR still does method calls via the interfaces even when concrete implementations of TComponentB and TComponentC are specified as generic type parameters and all of the classes are declared as sealed. The only way to get the CLR to do non-virtual calls is by changing all of the classes to structs (which implement the interfaces). Using struct doesn't really make sense for DI though and makes the issue below even more unsolvable.</p>

<p>The second issue with the above solution is that it can't handle circular references. I can't think of any way, either by C# code, or by constructing expression trees, to handle circular references because that would entail infinitely recursing generic types. (.Net does support generic types referencing itself, but it doesn't seem to generalize to this case.) Since only structs can cause the CLR to bypass the interfaces, I don't think this problem is solvable at all because circular references between structs could cause a paradox.</p>

<p>There's only one other solution I can think of and it's guaranteed to work - emit all of the classes from scratch at runtime, maybe basing them on compiled classes as templates. Not really an ideal solution though.</p>

<p>Anyone have better ideas?</p>

<p>Edit: In regards to most of the comments, I guess I should say that this is filed under ""pure intellectual curiosity"" I debated whether to ask this because I do realize that I don't have any concrete case in which it's necessary. I was just thinking about it for fun and was wondering whether anyone else came across this before.</p>
","34211","","<p>While a <code>callvirt</code> instruction does take longer this is usually done because it provides a cheap <code>null</code> check for the CLR prior to making the call to the method.

<p>Have you found that you could significantly improve the performance of your application by creating types (either <code>structs</code> or classes with static methods) that allow you to guarantee that the C# compiler will emit <code>call</code> instructions rather than <code>callvirt</code> instructions?</p>

"<p>Is there a reason why there is an option for a Boolean and a bool?  I dont seem to see the difference.</p>
","34211","","<p>In Java, <code>Boolean</code> is a class and <code>bool</code> is a primitive.  Even though Java supports autoboxing this only masks the syntactic inconvenience but does not convey the performance hit involved.  In Java, it is important to know the difference between the two and when it matters.</p>

<p>In C#, <code>bool</code> is simply an alias for <code>System.Boolean</code> - they are synonymous and can be used interchangeably.  The compiler will actually translate all instances of the <code>bool</code> keyword into <code>System.Boolean</code> in the resulting IL. However, while the compiled types are the same, the designers of C# intended users to express language primitives using their short form names (<code>bool</code>, <code>int</code>, etc.). So the ""C# way of doing things"" is using <code>bool</code> over <code>System.Boolean</code>.</p>

"<p>I have a User Control with a label on it. I have a Master Page that I have dropped the User Control on. I have other .aspx pages that use the master page that has the user control on it.</p>

<p>What is the best way to change the text of that label on the user control from the .aspx page?</p>
","34211","","<p>You have a couple of options but the best way would be to create a method on the user control that wraps the text property of your label and allows users to pass in a value that you in turn assign to the label's <code>Text</code> property.  </p>

<p>Then create another method on your Master Page that accepts a string parameter and passes that value through to the method on your user control.  Then you can call this method on your Master Page from your web form.</p>

<p>So on your user control add a method like this:</p>

<pre><code>Public Sub SetDisplayText(ByVal displayText As String)
    SomeLabel.Text = displayText
End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>then add a method to your Master Page like this:</p>

<pre><code>Public Sub SetDisplayText(ByVal displayText As String)
    SomeUserControl.SetDisplayText(displayText)
End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>Now your web form can call the <code>SetDisplayText</code> method on the Master Page to set the text on the user control's label:</p>

<pre><code>Dim masterPage As SomeMasterPage = TryCast(Me.Master, SomeMasterPage)

If masterPage IsNot Nothing Then
    masterPage.SetDisplayText(""foo"")
End If
</code></pre>

<p>This may feel like overkill but this kind of abstraction is necessary to reduce coupling between your components.  This approach also gives you a lot of flexibility moving forward as changes can be made without affecting other components.  For instance, if you rename your label control you will not need to go change the web form that sets its text value as the web form won't know (or care) what the label is called, only how to set its display value.</p>

<p><b>Why is the ID property not being serialized with the name I have provided in the DataMember attribute in the base class?</b></p>
","34211","","<p>It is because you have declared that setter for the property as <code>private</code> - since it is private, the DataContractSerializer is serializing the backing field and using its name rather then the property.</p>

<p>The DataContractSerializer will happily serialize any members that you ask it to but with respect to the semantics of the language.

","34211","","<p>The problem with a generic singleton factory is that since it is generic you do not control the ""singleton"" type that is instantiated so you can never guarantee that the instance you create will be the only instance in the application.</p>

"<p>I have a logic where I am building XML data in a method. The XML data is built off either a ArrayList or a ModelClass. For both of these, the logic to build XML is exactly the same. Currently I have 2 separate methods to handle this and thus code duplication. I want to use 1 single method which can take either a collection or a class as a parameter. Is it possible? Do I need to think of some other way to optimize this?
Thanks for your help.</p>
","34211","","<p>Why not create one method that accepts a collection and then iterate the collection and process each item.  This way you can call the method with a collection of many or a collection of one item - they will all be processed the same way.</p>

<p>This assumes that you would rather offset the inconvenience to the caller of the method since they will be required to create a collection in the case of a single item.  If that is a concern to you then you should simply create two methods and have the method that accepts the collection call the method that selects the single value so that the implementation is still shared.</p>

"<p>I have a few questions about cross-page posting in ASP.NET:</p>

<ul>
<li>What is cross-page posting in ASP.NET? </li>
<li>When should I consider using it in my web application? </li>
<li>What are pros and cons of cross-page posting?</li>
</ul>
","34211","","<p>Basically, cross-page posting means that you are posting form data to another page as opposed to posting form data back to the same page (as is the default in ASP.NET).  This can be useful when you want to post data to another page and don't want to incur the overhead of reloading the current page simply to redirect the user to another page via an HTTP 302 (i.e. <code>Response.Redirect</code>).</p>

<p>For a more information please see <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms178139.aspx"">Cross-Page Posting in ASP.NET Web Pages</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By default, buttons and other controls
  that cause a postback on an ASP.NET
  Web page submit the page back to
  itself. This is part of the round-trip
  cycle that ASP.NET Web pages go
  through as part of their normal
  processing. For details, see
  Introduction to ASP.NET Web Pages.</p>
  
  <p>Under some circumstances, you might
  want to post one page to another page.
  For example, you might be creating a
  multi-page form that collects
  different information on each page. In
  that case, you can configure certain
  controls (those that implement the
  IButtonControl interface, such as the
  Button control) on the page to post to
  a different target page. This is
  referred to as cross-page posting.
  Cross-page posting provides some
  advantages over using the Transfer
  method to redirect to another page.

"<p>I was working on a public comments part of an application on Friday when I got a stack overflow error, which confused me so I thought I'd ask for help.  And searching the web using the expression 'stack overflow' is a bit self-defeating!</p>

<p>I wanted to do an HtmlEncode on the set statement of the field in the class, before sending an instance of the class to be added to the database:</p>

<pre><code>public class Feedback
{

    public Feedback() { }

    public string FeedbackComment
    {
        get { return FeedbackComment; }
        set {System.Web.HttpUtility.HtmlEncode(value); }
    }

    // other fields 

    // methods
}

<p>This was causing StackOverflow errors, I've fixed the error by changing the code to look like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class Feedback
{

    public Feedback() { }

    private string feedbackComment;

    public string FeedbackComment
    {
        get { return feedbackComment; }
        set { feedbackComment = System.Web.HttpUtility.HtmlEncode(value); }
    }

    // other fields 

    // methods
} 
</code></pre>

<p>But I just wanted an explanation of why the first get/set statements were so recursive that they caused a stack overflow but when reverting the code to look more like c#2.0 worked?  Can this be achieved with the shorter syntax and if so how?</p>

<p>This is my first question on SO - please try to be gentle!</p>
","34211","","<p>The getter of the first example is returning the property itself, not a backing field.  </p>

public string FeedbackComment
{

    // creating the stack overflow
    get { return FeedbackComment; }

<p>Unfortunately there is no way to shorten what you have, automatically implemented properties (i.e. <code>public String FeedbackComment { get; set; }</code>) must have empty getter and setter blocks to be syntactically correct.  There is nothing wrong with your second example - yes, it is a bit verbose but it is clear, concise, and gets the job done.</p>

"<p>Does anyone know the answer and/or have an oppinion about it?</p>

<p>Since tuples would normally not be very large I would assume it would make more sense to use structs than classes for these. What say you?</p>
","34211","","<p>The reason is most likely because only the smaller tuples would make sense as value types since they would have a small memory footprint.  The larger tuples (i.e. the ones with more properties) would actually suffer in performance since they would be larger than 16 bytes.</p>

<p>Rather than have some tuples be value types and others be reference types and force developers to know which are which I would imagine the folks at Microsoft thought making them all reference types was simpler.</p>

<p>Ah, suspicions confirmed!  Please see <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dd942829.aspx#id0400060"">Building Tuple</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The first major decision was whether
  to treat tuples either as a reference
  or value type. Since they are
  immutable any time you want to change
  the values of a tuple, you have to
  create a new one. If they are
  reference types, this means there can
  be lots of garbage generated if you
  are changing elements in a tuple in a
  tight loop. F# tuples were reference
  types, but there was a feeling from
  the team that they could realize a
  performance improvement if two, and
  perhaps three, element tuples were
  value types instead. Some teams that
  had created internal tuples had used
  value instead of reference types,
  because their scenarios were very
  sensitive to creating lots of managed
  objects. They found that using a value
  type gave them better performance. In
  our first draft of the tuple
  specification, we kept the two-,
  three-, and four-element tuples as
  value types, with the rest being
  reference types. However, during a
  design meeting that included
  representatives from other languages
  it was decided that this ""split""
  design would be confusing, due to the
  slightly different semantics between
  the two types. Consistency in behavior
  and design was determined to be of
  higher priority than potential
  performance increases. Based on this
  input, we changed the design so that
  all tuples are reference types,
  although we asked the F# team to do
  some performance investigation to see
  if it experienced a speedup when using
  a value type for some sizes of tuples.
  It had a good way to test this, since
  its compiler, written in F#, was a
  good example of a large program that
  used tuples in a variety of scenarios.
  In the end, the F# team found that it
  did not get a performance improvement
  when some tuples were value types
  instead of reference types. This made
  us feel better about our decision to
  use reference types for tuple.</p>

"<p>For a class instance to work properly, some fields should be properly initialized, what's your strategy to initialize these field, what should be given through constructor, what should be given through property?</p>

<p>My confusion is that, if the constructor requires a long parameter list, it's hard to use, if through properties, i tend to forget to set some properties.</p>

<p>What's the best practice?</p>
","34211","","<p>This is always a balancing act - you don't want to have constructors that require many parameters but you also don't want to require that a user set many properties before an object is in a valid state.  Unfortunately there is no real guidance here as you must use your best judgment for the situation at hand.</p>

<p>Many times you may need to create a composite type which has many properties and many possible configurations (e.g. <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.ui.page.aspx"" rel=""nofollow""><code>System.Web.Page</code></a>).  Composite types tend to have simple constructors that take little or no parameters and all values must be set through properties.  Composite types are high-level types that are composed of lower-level factored (or primitive) types.</p>

<p>Factored types tend to be simpler, contain less state, and can be completely initialized via their constructors.  Examples of factored types are <code>System.String</code> and <code>System.Int32</code>.  These types are very simple and tend to be the building blocks of composite types.</p>

<p>If your type is a factored type then try your best to allow consumers to initialize the type completely via the constructor.  If your type is a composite type then it is better to offer simple constructors with little or no parameters and require that the consumer configure the instance via property setters.</p>

","34211","","<p>A hashcode is an integer value that represents the state of the object upon which it was called.  That is why an <code>Integer</code> that is set to 1 will return a hashcode of ""1"" because an <code>Integer's</code> hashcode and its value are the same thing.

","34211","","<p><del>No, <code>()</code> isn't an operator so it cannot be overloaded.</del> (<em>This is incorrect, please see Eric Lippert's comment below</em>)  The parentheses are part of C#'s <em>syntax</em> that are used to express a set of arguments that are passed to a method.  <code>()</code> simply indicates that the method in question specified no formal parameters and therefore requires no arguments.</p>

<p>What are you trying to do?  Perhaps if you gave a small example of the problem we would be able to help with a solution.</p>

<pre><code>Action action = someA.Foo;

<p>Then you could invoke the delegate with a simple syntax like this:</p>

var concatArray;
concatArray = names.concat(ages);
</code></pre>

<p>My question is, why doesn't the variable <code>concatArray</code> need to be define as a <code>new Array()</code> in order to store the concatenated data for both arrays <i>name</i> and <i>ages</i> , but when I try to treat the <code>concatArray</code> as an array by adding another line of code ""<code>document.write(concatArray[0])</code>"", it works just like an array and shows me the data stored in the first element. I just wonder why I'm not declaring the <code>concatArray</code> as a new array, yet it still works as one.</p>
","34211","","<p>You are declaring <code>concatArray</code> as a new array but the declaration is implicit.  The <a href=""http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_concat_array.asp"" rel=""nofollow""><code>concat</code></a> function returns a new array which contains concatenated copies of the original two arrays.  The type of <code>concatArray</code> is inferred from the return type of the <code>concat</code> function.</p>

"<p>I have an abstract base class that holds a Dictionary. I'd like inherited classes to be able to access the dictionary fields using a convenient syntax. Currently I have lots of code like this:</p>

<pre><code>string temp;
int val;

    if (int.TryParse(temp, out val)) {
        // do something with val...
    }
}

<p>Is there any way to do something like this in C# (3.5)?</p>
","34211","","<p>You could add an indexer to your class and pass the indexer's parameter through to the dictionary.</p>

        }
        return val;

"<p>I have a Queue that contains a collection of objects, one of these objects is a class called GlobalMarker that has a member called GlobalIndex. </p>

"<p>I love auto-implemented properties in C# but lately there's been this elephant standing in my cubicle and I don't know what to do with him.</p>

<p>If I use auto-implemented properties (hereafter ""aip"") then I no longer have a private backing field to use internally. This is fine because the aip has no side-effects. But what if later on I need to add some extra processing in the get or set? </p>

<p>Now I need to create a backing-field so I can expand my getters and setters. This is fine for external code using the class, because they won't notice the difference. But now all of the internal references to the aip are going to invoke these side-effects when they access the property. Now all internal access to the once aip must be refactored to use the backing-field.</p>

<p>So my question is, what do most of you do? Do you use auto-implemented properties or do you prefer to always use a backing-field? What do you think about properties with side-effects?</p>
","34211","","<p><a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/ericlippert/archive/2009/01/14/automatic-vs-explicit-properties.aspx"">Eric Lippert has an excellent blog post</a> that answers this question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the reason that motivated the
  change from automatically implemented
  property to explicitly implemented
  property was to change the semantics
  of the property then you should
  evaluate whether the desired semantics
  when accessing the property from
  within the class are identical to or
  different from the desired semantics
  when accessing the property from
  outside the class.</p>
  
  <p>If the result of that investigation is
  “from within the class, the desired
  semantics of accessing this property
  are different from the desired
  semantics of accessing the property
  from the outside”, then your edit has
  introduced a bug. You should fix the
  bug. If they are the same, then your
  edit has not introduced a bug; keep
  the implementation the same.</p>

"<p>I'm currently working with web services that return objects such as a list of files e.g. File array.</p>

<p>I wanted to know whether its best practice to bind this type of object directly to my front end code for example a repeater/listview or whether to first parse it into my own list of ""file class"" e.g. <code>customFiles[]</code></p>

<p>If the web service changes then it will break my front end code, however if I create my own CustomFile class, then i would only need to change my code in one place to fix the issue, but it just seems like a lot of extra work to create the same classes from a web service, i wanted to know what is the best practice for this type of work.</p>
","34211","","<p>There is a delicate balancing act in properly encapsulating implementation details.  Too little encapsulation is a maintenance nightmare as small changes in any area break the application.  Too many layers is a different kind of maintenance headache altogether.</p>

<p>In this particular case I would create a small layer in your application to encapsulate the web service calls.  This will ease your maintenance in both the application and the service as they will be loosely coupled.</p>

"<p>Good Morning,</p>

"<p>Coming from a C++ background, one thing that confuses me about Objective C is the fact that you can add a method to a class without actually specifying it in the class interface. So I had a barrage of questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Why would someone choose to not add the method in the class interface? </li>
<li>Is it simply because of visibility? </li>
<li>Methods without a declaration in the interface are private? </li>
<li>Is declaring methods in a class interface just optional?</li>
<li>Is it different for overriding a base class' method?</li>

","34211","","<p>I believe that this is the only way to create private methods in Objective-C.  The language does not support the ability to declare a private method so by not declaring a method in the header file you are making private from all callers.</p>

"<p>In my project I use quite complicated (and nested) collection:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>As I use it in whe same way in several places in my project, I would like to convert it to new class. But I have some doubts...</p>

<p>What is the best way to handle this sort of collections, create an inner field and pass as public only selected items:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyComplicatedCollection
{
    private List&lt;Pair&lt;List&lt;Pair&lt;double&gt;&gt;, double&gt;&gt; myInnerCollection = null;

    // Here come some constructors, data accessors etc... only to those elements which I would like to pass as public.
}
</code></pre>

<p>Or maybe in other way, by deriving the original collection:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyComplicatedCollection : List&lt;Pair&lt;List&lt;Pair&lt;double&gt;&gt;, double&gt;&gt;
{

    // Here come some constructors, 
    // Most of the data accessors are given ""out of the box""
}
</code></pre>

<p>Second way seems to be easier, but not as safe as the first way. The other thing is performance - these collections are really big and I need quite fast access to it - it is crucial. </p>

<p>And the second question: if the second way is better... For <code>List</code> there is a constructor when you can populate your collection by passing any <code>ICollection</code>. Is there any easy way of  creating such constructor for my class, or do I need to populate my collection element by element (or using <code>AddRange</code> method)? </p>
","34211","","<p>When in doubt use composition.  Inheritance is hard to do right and you should only use it if you <em>must</em> have a <code>IS-A</code> relationship between your new type and the base/composed type.  In this case I think that composition (i.e. your first example) is the best solution.</p>

<p>Composition gives you the flexibility to build your type with whatever public interface you desire.  Inheritance dictates that interface to you and also creates a tight coupling between your new type and its base type which can make future modifications difficult.</p>

"<p>Lets assume that a rule (or rule of thumb, anyway), has been imposed in my coding environment that any method on a class that doesn't use, modify, or otherwise need any instance variables to do its work, be made static.  Is there any inherent compile time, runtime, or any other disadvantage to doing this?</p>

<p>(edited for further clarifications)</p>

<p>I know the question was somewhat open ended and vague so I apologize for that.  My intent in asking was in the context of mostly ""helper"" methods.  Utility classes (with private CTORs so they can't be instantiated) as holders for static methods we already do.  My question here was more in line of these little methods that HELP OUT the main class API.</p>

<p>I might have 4 or 5 main API/instance methods on a class that do the real work, but in the course of doing so they share some common functionality that might only be working on the input parameters to the API method, and not internal state.  THESE are the code sections I typically pull out into their own helper methods, and if they don't need to access the class' state, make them static.</p>

<p>My question was thus, is this inherently a bad idea, and if so, why? (Or why not?)</p>
","34211","","<p>No, actually the reason for that advice is that it provides a performance advantage.  Static methods can be called with less overhead so any method that doesn't need a reference to <code>this</code> ought to be made static.</p>

"<p>How does virtual functions work behind the scenes in Inheritance ?
Does the compiler treat virtual functions specially ?</p>
","34211","","<p>Yes, virtual methods are treated differently by the compiler and the runtime.  The JVM specifically utilizes a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_method_table"">virtual method table</a> for virtual method dispatch:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An object's dispatch table will
  contain the addresses of the object's
  dynamically bound methods. Method
  calls are performed by fetching the
  method's address from the object's
  dispatch table. The dispatch table is
  the same for all objects belonging to
  the same class, and is therefore
  typically shared between them. Objects
  belonging to type-compatible classes
  (for example siblings in an
  inheritance hierarchy) will have
  dispatch tables with the same layout:
  the address of a given method will
  appear at the same offset for all
  type-compatible classes. Thus,
  fetching the method's address from a
  given dispatch table offset will get
  the method corresponding to the
  object's actual class.</p>

  <p>In computer science, string interning

  makes some string processing tasks

"<p>I've got a complex class in my C# project on which I want to be able to do equality tests.  It is not a trivial class; it contains a variety of scalar properties as well as references to other objects and collections (e.g. IDictionary).  For what it's worth, my class is sealed.</p>

<p>To enable a performance optimization elsewhere in my system (an optimization that avoids a costly network round-trip), I need to be able to compare instances of these objects to each other for equality &ndash; other than the built-in reference equality &ndash; and so I'm overriding the Object.Equals() instance method.  However, now that I've done that, Visual Studio 2008's Code Analysis a.k.a. FxCop, which I keep enabled by default, is raising the following warning:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>warning : CA2218 : Microsoft.Usage : Since 'MySuperDuperClass'
      redefines Equals, it should also redefine GetHashCode.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>I think I understand the rationale for this warning:</em>  <strong>If</strong> I am going to be using such objects as the <strong>key</strong> in a collection, the hash code is important. i.e. <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/371328/why-is-it-important-to-override-gethashcode-when-equals-method-is-overriden-in-c"">see this question</a>. <strong>However, I am not going to be using these objects as the key in a collection.  Ever.</strong></p>

<p>Feeling justified to suppress the warning, I looked up <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms182358.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">code CA2218 in the MSDN documentation</a> to get the full name of the warning so I could apply a <code>SuppressMessage</code> attribute to my class as follows:</p>

<pre><code>    [SuppressMessage(""Microsoft.Naming"",
        ""CA2218:OverrideGetHashCodeOnOverridingEquals"",
        Justification=""This class is not to be used as key in a hashtable."")]

<p>However, while reading further, I noticed the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>How to Fix Violations</strong></p>
  
  <p>To fix a violation of this rule,
  provide an implementation of
  GetHashCode. For a pair of objects of
  the same type, you must ensure that
  the implementation returns the same
  value if your implementation of Equals
  returns true for the pair.  </p>
  
  <p><strong>When to Suppress Warnings</strong></p>
  
  <p>-----> <em>Do not suppress a warning from this
  rule.</em> [arrow &amp; emphasis mine]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, I'd like to know: <strong>Why shouldn't I suppress this warning as I was planning to?</strong>  Doesn't my case warrant suppression?  I don't want to code up an implementation of GetHashCode() for this object that will never get called, since my object will never be the key in a collection.  If I wanted to be pedantic, instead of suppressing, would it be more reasonable for me to override GetHashCode() with an implementation that throws a NotImplementedException?</p>

  <p>If you're defining a type that won't
  ever be used as the key in a
  container, this won't matter.  Types
  that represent window controls, web
  page controls, or database connections
  are unlikely to be used as keys in a
  collection.  In those cases, do
  nothing.  All reference types will
  have a hash code that is correct, even
  if it is very inefficient. [...] In
  most types that you create, the best
  approach is to avoid the existence of
  GetHashCode() entirely.</p>

<p>... that's where I originally got this idea that I need not be concerned about GetHashCode() always.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For each (or foreach) is a computer
  language idiom for traversing items in
  a collection. Foreach is usually used
  in place of a standard for statement.
  Unlike other for loop constructs,
  however, foreach loops <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreach"" rel=""nofollow"">1</a>  usually
  maintain no explicit counter: they
  essentially say ""do this to everything

{
    // implementation of Foo and all its inherited interfaces

   Debug.Assert(interfaces.Length == 1);
   Debug.Assert(interfaces[0] == typeof(IDisposable));
}
</code></pre>

<p>Can someone help by fixing this method so the assertions don't fail?</p>

<p>Calling <code>typeof(Bar).GetInterfaces()</code> doesn't work because it returns the entire interface hierarchy (i.e. <code>interfaces</code> variable contains <code>IEnumerable&lt;int&gt;</code>, <code>IEnumerable</code>, and <code>IDisposable</code>), not just the top level.</p>
","34211","","<p>There really isn't any way to do this since you are retrieving all interfaces from the interface hierarchy.  This means that when you implement <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code> you are also implicitly implementing <code>IEnumerable</code> as well.</p>

<p>In other words, if you look at the IL for the class you have created you will see this:</p>

<pre><code>.class public auto ansi beforefieldinit Foo
        extends [mscorlib]System.Object
        implements [mscorlib]System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable`1&lt;int32&gt;, 
                   [mscorlib]System.Collections.IEnumerable
{
    // ... 
}
</code></pre>

<p>Even though you only indicated that your type implements <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code>, the compiler has emitted IL that indicates your type implements <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>IEnumerable</code>.  </p>

<p>The reflection API is happily returning what you have actually defined on the type (which is that your type implements both interfaces - which it actually does).  The C# compiler allows you to only reference the bottommost type in the interface hierarchy as it will fill in the other interfaces that your type also implements.  This is one of the ways that interface inheritance differs from type inheritance.</p>

<p>The problem occurs when I use Firebug to remove the ""disabled"" attribute, and to change the selected option.<br />
On submission of the form, and re-creation of the field, the newly generated control has the correct value by the end of OnLoad, but by OnPreRender, it has assumed the identity of the submitted control and has been given the submitted form value.<br />
.NET seems to have no way of detecting the fact that the field was originally created in a disabled state and that the submitted value was faked. This is understandable, as there could be legitimate, client-side functionality that would allow the disabled attribute to be removed.</p>

<p>Is there some way, other than a brute force approach, of detecting that this field's value should not have been changed?</p>

<p>I see the brute force approach as being something crap, like saving the correct value somewhere while still in OnLoad, and restoring the value in the OnPreRender. As some fields have dependencies on others, that would be unacceptable to me.</p>
","34211","","<p>If this is truly a concern then persist a value on the server somewhere (in session perhaps) that indicates that the control was set as disabled on the initial render of the page.

<h3>Edit</h3>

<p>This is secure against client tampering because a disabled control is never submitted by the form and as such the modified data will never reach the server.

  that object is reachable through a

  references. At the same time it
  will declare all of the formerly

","34211","","<p>Honestly I would start with C# 2 then learn 3 and 4.  C# 2 is really the core of the language - everything in 3 and 4 builds on 2.  Starting with C# 4 may be a bit intimidating simply because the language has recently added so many features.  By starting with C# 2 you can get a solid understanding of the core language syntax and features then you will have a foundation for learning the more advanced concepts presented in the later versions of the language.</p>

"<p>I know that in C# 3.0 you can do some functional programming magic with Linq and lambda expression and all that stuff. However, is it really possible to go completely ""pure"" functional in C#?

","34211","Andrew Hare","<p>Unfortunately no - C# is not a pure functional language and it does not intend to be.  What has happened is that the C# team has seen that there are benefits to adding certain functionally-styled constructs and syntax to the language.</p>

"<p>A ""non-believer"" of C# was asking me what the purpose to extension methods was. I explained that you could then add new methods to objects that were already defined, especially when you don't own/control the source to the original object.</p>

<p>He brought up ""Why not just add a method to your own class?"" We've been going round and round (in a good way). My general response is that it is another tool in the toolbelt, and his response is it is a useless waste of a tool... but I thought I'd get a more ""enlightened"" answer.</p>

<p>What are some scenarios that you've used extension methods that you couldn't have (or shouldn't have) used a method added on to your own class?</p>
","34211","Andrew Hare","<p>The <strong>only</strong> advantage of extension methods is code readability.  That's it.</p>

<p>Extension methods allow you to do this:</p>

<pre><code>foo.bar();
</code></pre>

<p>instead of this:</p>

<pre><code>Util.bar(foo);
</code></pre>

<p>Now there are a lot of things in C# that are like this.  In other words there are many features in C# that seem trivial and don't have great benefit in and of themselves.  However once you begin combining these features together you begin to see something just a bit bigger than the sum of its parts.  LINQ benefits greatly from extension methods as LINQ queries would be almost unreadable without them.  LINQ would be <em>possible</em> without extension methods, but not practical.</p>

<p>Extension methods are a lot like C#'s partial classes.  By themselves they are not very helpful and seem trivial.  But when you start working with a class that needs generated code, partial classes start to make a lot more sense.</p>

"<p>I am creating a page that has several user controls (similar to WebParts). Each widget has a common UI section and Content section.</p>

","34211","Andrew Hare","<p>Unfortunately MasterPages are designed to work with the <code>Page</code> type.

"<p>Trying this I have found a strange problem: Delete an old file. Create a new file and name it the same as the old file. Then the ""created time"" property of the new file is set to the ""created time"" of the old file. Why is that happens? And how of course? It seems that the directory does not delete the old file's entry and if a new file gets created in the same folder then the old entry is used.</p>
","34211","Andrew Hare","<p>The NT file system does not delete a file when you think it does.  When you delete a file on an NT file system the operating system simply marks the disk space that file occupied as available.  The file will not be truly deleted until another file is written to that location on disk.</p>

<p>As to why Windows would think it was the same exact file I believe this is due to the fact that the file was empty when you deleted it so creating a new file in the same location with the same name and the same (empty) contents makes Windows think it is in fact the same file.  I would consider this to be a bug.</p>

<p>As a side note, the fact that Windows handles file deletes in this way is the very reason that you are able to use file-recovery utilities to recover deleted files.</p>

"<p>I need a very, very fast one-to-one algorithm.  The algorithm doesn't need to be unbreakable.  Reasonably strong is enough but it must be lightning fast.  I will be implementing it in hardware.  Area is a concern, too, so it shouldn't use too much logic.</p>

<p>It should be a function f_N(x) whose input is an N-bit number and whose output is an N-bit number.  N is a constant, probably between 20-70.  The function must be one-to-one.  (ie invertible, meaning that decryption is possible.  Decryption speed is irrelevant.)</p>

<p>I need to encrypt in under 3ns, which is about 333M inputs per second.  DES, for example, does about 50Mbits per second.  I need 333M <strong>inputs</strong> per second.  </p>

<p>So far I've been using a Feistel cipher with about 6 rounds.  That seems to take about 3ns.</p>

<p>Suggestions?</p>

<p><strong>More notes</strong></p>

<p>There have been some questions so I'll explain.  I need to put keys into a hash table.  The standard method is to hash the input key and use the result as an index into a table.  Each row in the table must store the original key.  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information%5Ftheory"" rel=""nofollow"">Information theory</a> tells us that the rows of the table don't actually need to be as wide as the input key, but rather as wide as the input key <strong>less</strong> the number of bits in the address of the table.  For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>input: x (N bits)</li>
<li>hash: x%128 (8 bits)</li>
<li>verifier: floor(x/128) (N-8 bits)</li>
</ul>

<p>It would be silly on a CPU where integers are usually the same width but I'm doing it in hardware.</p>

<p>x%128 is an easy hash to break.  In fact, if the input keys only differ in the first few bits, you will have broken the hash on accident.  I want a hash that won't be broken on accident and might even be difficult to break on purpose.  I also tried an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear%5Ffeedback%5Fshift%5Fregister"" rel=""nofollow"">LFSR</a>.  LFSRs are fast but two LFSRs of equal length generate hash results that are correlated linearly.  (If f(x) and g(x) give the same hash for two different polynomials, f(x+1) and g(x+1) are easily correlated.)</p>

<p>So, I need a function with N-bit input and V-bit,H-bit output (V+H=N) where it is difficult to find two inputs of length N such that both will output the same H.  Encryption fits the bill in that it leaves the output the same length as the input and it is difficult to reverse.  Something other than encryption might work, too, though it seems like what I want is almost the very definition of encryption.</p>

<p>Sorry about not explaining all this up-front.  Hope that this clarifies things.</p>
","34211","","<p>I am wondering if you are not concerned about the strength of the encryption then perhaps you don't need to be encrypting at all.  The <strong>most</strong> important part of an encryption algorithm is is it strength.  If the encryption is weak then you are not doing any good by encrypting in the first place.</p>

"<p>I want to save my program's DataModel objects to a file, and be able to reload the same object graph again. I want it to be in some flavor of text file, so I can diff it and open it in a text editor. XML would be fine, and seems like a good place to start since .NET has XML serialization built in.</p>

<p>But which flavor of XML serialization should I pick? I know about <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.runtime.serialization.formatters.soap.soapformatter.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">SoapFormatter</a> (but it's deprecated now), <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.markup.xamlwriter.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">XamlWriter</a> (nice but very limited), <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.xml.serialization.xmlserializer.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">XmlSerializer</a> and <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.runtime.serialization.datacontractserializer.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">DataContractSerializer</a> (neither of which I know much about yet). (And that's just the ones from Microsoft - good grief!)</p>

<p>I'm also open to open-source frameworks, and I'm not tied to XML (<a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.script.serialization.javascriptserializer.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">JavaScriptSerializer</a> looks interesting too).</p>

<p>Some of my general preferences in a serialization framework:</p>

<ul>
<li>I really shouldn't have to write any code (or XML configuration files) to get a newly-added property to serialize. I could (grudgingly) accept having to add an attribute, but the less overhead there is on me, the better.</li>
<li>Convention over configuration is <em>good.</em></li>
<li>Bonus points for anything that can serialize a cyclic object graph. I <em>could</em> avoid this, if I had to, but I'd rather not make my coding harder just for the convenience of someone else's serialization framework.</li>
<li>I prefer something that saves property values, rather than reaching directly into the private fields.</li>
<li>I'd like something that allows some future-proofing. If I rename a property or an enum value, I don't want my old files to be toast; I want some way to define an upgrade path and remap the values on load (preferably without writing reams of XML configuration files), and I want to be able to write automated regression tests that prove I can open old files.</li>
<li>If it can automatically ignore my objects' events, without me needing to add extra attributes to every one, that'd be great. Events would never make sense to write to a text format.</li>
<li>It would be extra-cool if it worked in Silverlight as well as full-fledged .NET. (I don't have any near-term need for this; it would just be cool.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Suggestions?</p>

  frequently:</p>
  
  <p><em>User: With “regular” explicit properties, I tend to use the private
  backing field directly from within the
  class. Of course, with an automatic
  property, you can’t do this. My
  concern is that in the future, if I
  decide I need an explicit property for
  whatever reason, I’m left with the
  choice of changing the class
  implementation to use the new private
  field, or continue going through the
  property. I’m not sure what the right
  thing to do in this case is.</em> </p>
  
  <p>You say “for whatever reason”, and
  that's key. The answer to your
  question will depend entirely upon
  what the reason was that motivated the
  change.</p>
  
  <p>If the reason that motivated the
  change from automatically implemented
  property to explicitly implemented
  property was to change the semantics
  of the property then <strong><em>you should
  evaluate whether the desired semantics
  when accessing the property from
  within the class are identical to or
  different from the desired semantics
  when accessing the property from
  outside the class.</em></strong> [emphasis mine]</p>

"<p>I'm used to using iterations of Visual Studio for my IDE needs, but I've long since wiped the machine I had that on and don't think I can have the program reinstalled on new main machine.  Because of this I've mostly been using Geany to write up my code, then FireFTP to send it off to a faraway UNIX machine, then using gcc or g++ to compile my code.  While I have no real qualms with this method, it is a bit annoying to have to always send off my code to a faraway machine just to compile and test it (as well as the constant back and forth between Geany and FireFTP when I have to do fixes and updates).  This also causes an unintentional problem where I can only make executable files for the UNIX machine, but bringing it back over to my Windows machine for testing wouldn't work (unless there's something I don't know about that could make this work).</p>

"<p>I am trying to create a class in VB.NET which inherits a base abstract class and also implements an interface. The interface declares a string property called Description. The base class contains a string property called Description. The main class inherits the base class and implements the interface. The existence of the Description property in the base class fulfills the interface requirements. This works fine in C# but causes issues in VB.NET.</p>

<p>First, here is an example of the C# code which works:</p>

<pre><code>public interface IFoo
{
    string Description { get; set; }
}

public abstract class FooBase
{
    public string Description { get; set; }
}

public class MyFoo : FooBase, IFoo
{
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now here is the VB.NET version which gives a compiler error:</p>

<pre><code>Public Interface IFoo
    Property Description() As String
End Interface

Public MustInherit Class FooBase
    Private _Description As String
    Public Property Description() As String
        Get
            Return _Description
        End Get
        Set(ByVal value As String)
            _Description = value
        End Set
    End Property
End Class

Public Class MyFoo
    Inherits FooBase
    Implements IFoo
End Class
</code></pre>

<p>If I make the base class (<code>FooBase</code>) implement the interface and add the <code>Implements IFoo.Description</code> to the property all is good, but I do not want the base class to implement the interface.</p>

<p>The compiler error is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Class 'MyFoo' must implement 'Property Description() As String' for interface 'IFoo'. Implementing property must have matching 'ReadOnly' or 'WriteOnly' specifiers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Can VB.NET not handle this, or do I need to change my syntax somewhere to get this to work?</p>
","34211","","<p>This is a strange issue and it clearly shows a difference between the C# and VB.NET compilers.  I would suggest that you do implement the interface on the abstract base class as this will make the VB.NET compiler happy and at execution time your child class will still have metadata indicating that it does in fact implement <code>IFoo</code>.</p>

<p>Thanks for any help!</p>
","34211","","<p>Java does not support this.  You can leverage polymorphism to treat an instance of <code>B</code> as and instance of <code>A</code> but not the other way around.</p>

<p>The reason you cannot do this is because there is no type-safe way to guarantee that your instance of <code>A</code> is in fact an instance of <code>B</code> (you could cast the instance but even if you did you would only be guaranteeing yourself an exception at execution time).</p>

<p>The best way to tell if there is a type-safe, polymorphic relationship between types is to test this statement for validity:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Any instance of some type is an instance of some other type.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>For instance:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Any instance of Dog is an instance of Mammal.</em><br>
  <em>Any instance of Mammal is an instance of Dog.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Notice that the first example is true while the second is false. What you are trying to do in your code example is exactly like trying to treat any mammal as a dog - even though it may be true occasionally it is not true categorically which means the compiler will not allow it.</p>

<p>Again, for times when it could be true you must cast the reference but this opens you up for exceptions at execution time.  Your specific example above is one of those times when an exception would occur as we can clearly see that you have instantiated an instance of type <code>A</code>.</p>

<p>Except saving some CPU/RAM/etc by freeing the UI from updating something that will probably look the same on the screen/whatever_medium what do we obtain?</p>

<p>Could some people force a refresh by reassigning the same value on a property (NOT THAT THIS WOULD BE A GOOD PRACTICE HOWEVER)?</p>

<p><strong>1. Should we do it or shouldn't we?</strong></p>

<p><strong>2. Why?</strong></p>
","34211","","<p>Yes, you should return immediately when the consumer is setting a property value that is equal to the value which is already being persisted.</p>

<p>First of all, there is no reason to waste any time or resources in the setter of the property - the value is already set so no further action is needed. Also you should never call <code>OnPropertyChanged</code> if the value stored in the property's backing field hasn't changed - the method is intended to be raised when the value has <em>changed</em> not when the property's setter has been called.</p>

<p>All that being said, however - if the setter didn't have a call to <code>OnPropertyChanged</code> I wouldn't have bothered to check the value first.  In the case of a simple setter that only sets the backing field's value and nothing else it is actually going to be faster to always the set the value rather than checking first then setting the value.  Only use this pattern when the property's setter has additional logic that either shouldn't fire or may incur an unnecessary performance penalty.</p>

","34211","","<p>You already have an <code>IEnumerable&lt;Student&gt;</code> instance and you cannot project entities from a query for the reasons described <a href=""http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/linqprojectgeneral/thread/1ce25da3-44c6-407d-8395-4c146930004b"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>)</p>

<p>You also don't need to create a list to bind to this data source - you can greatly simplify your method by changing it to this:</p>

<pre><code>public static IEnumerable&lt;Student&gt; GetStudents()
{
    return new DojoDBDataContext().Students;
}
</code></pre>

<p>There is no reason to project a new instance to only map a few of the properties, by executing the query you are returning all the values anyhow and your projection doesn't save you anything.  If you really want to only return a few values from this query for the purposes of information hiding you could do this:</p>

<pre><code>public static IEnumerable&lt;Object&gt; GetStudents()
{
    DojoDBDataContext conn = new DojoDBDataContext();

    return conn.Students
               .Select(s =&gt; new {
                   ID = s.ID,
                   FirstName = s.FirstName,

<p>Even though setting up an explicit cast took care of the issue I thought I'd provide an answer to the people wondering, WHY I was doing what I was.</p>

<p>In short, I'm sequentially processing a file.  Line by line.  I read the row into RawRow, and until I look at a few values, I don't actually know what type of row it is going to be.  I then wanted to cast it to the proper type.</p>
","34211","","<p>You will not be able to make this cast unless there is an inheritance relationship between the types.  If that is not possible then the best you can do is create an explicit conversion operator that allows you to cast one type as another type.</p>

<p>If you do create an explicit conversion you should understand that this will be slower than casting as you will be invoking an method that will do work as opposed to casting which only changes the reference type and doesn't change any of the memory on the heap.</p>

<p>Consider this example that doesn't compile:</p>

<pre><code>class Example
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Foo foo = new Foo();
        Bar bar = (Bar)foo;
    }
}

class Foo { }
class Bar { }
</code></pre>

<p>Since there is no inheritance relations between the types nor is there an explicit conversion from <code>Foo</code> to <code>Bar</code> this cannot compile.</p>

<p>But adding an explicit conversion allows it to compile:</p>

<pre><code>class Example
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Foo foo = new Foo();
        Bar bar = (Bar)foo;
    }

","34211","","<p>Yes, both of those queries are identical in function.  The compiler will actually take the second query and translate it into the first query as the LINQ language keywords are simply a language extension to C#.</p>

<p>Here is a similar example that shows this to be true:</p>

<pre><code>using System;
using System.Linq;

class Example
{
    static void Main()
    {
        var names = new[] { ""Andrew"", ""Nicole"", ""Michael"",
            ""Joe"", ""Sammy"", ""Joshua"" };

        var shortNames = from n in names
               where n.Length == 6
               select n;
        var first = names.First();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Using Reflector I was able to see the actual compiled code:</p>

<pre><code>internal class Example
{
    private static void Main()
    {
        string[] names = new string[] { ""Andrew"", ""Nicole"", ""Michael"", ""Joe"", ""Sammy"", ""Joshua"" };
        IEnumerable&lt;string&gt; shortNames = names.Where&lt;string&gt;(delegate (string n) {
            return n.Length == 6;
        });
        string first = names.First&lt;string&gt;();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, the query syntax I typed was changed by the compiler to call the extension methods from the <code>Enumerable</code> class.  The LINQ query keywords are simply a convenience to the developer that the compiler converts into method calls.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I did notice one difference between your two queries that I didn't notice at first glance.  Your first query will execute slightly faster since it passes a predicate to the <code>First</code> method.  This will be faster since your second query uses the <code>Where</code> method first to filter the results and then grabs the first record.  The second query uses two method calls while the first one uses only one.</p>

"<p>Consider, I have the following 3 classes / interfaces:</p>

<pre><code>class MyClass&lt;T&gt; { }

interface IMyInterface { }

class Derived : IMyInterface { }
</code></pre>

<p>And I want to be able to cast a <code>MyClass&lt;Derived&gt;</code> into a <code>MyClass&lt;IMyInterface&gt;</code> or visa-versa:</p>

<pre><code>MyClass&lt;Derived&gt; a = new MyClass&lt;Derived&gt;();
MyClass&lt;IMyInterface&gt; b = (MyClass&lt;IMyInterface&gt;)a;
</code></pre>

<p>But I get compiler errors if I try:</p>

<pre><code>Cannot convert type 'MyClass&lt;Derived&gt;' to 'MyClass&lt;IMyInterface&gt;'   
</code></pre>

<p>I'm sure there is a very good reason why I cant do this, but I can't think of one.</p>

<p>As for why I want to do this - The scenario I'm imagining is one whereby you ideally want to work with an instance of <code>MyClass&lt;Derived&gt;</code> in order to avoid lots of nasty casts, however you need to pass your instance to an interface that accepts <code>MyClass&lt;IMyInterface&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>So my question is twofold:</p>

<ul>
<li>Why can I not cast between these two types?</li>
<li>Is there any way of keeping the niceness of working with an instance of <code>MyClass&lt;Derived&gt;</code> while still being able to cast this into a <code>MyClass&lt;IMyInterface&gt;</code>?</li>
</ul>
","34211","","<p>This does not work because C# only supports covariance on the type parameters of interfaces and delegates.  If your type parameter exists only in output positions (i.e. you only return instances of it from your class and don't accept it as an argument) you could create an interface like this:</p>

<pre><code>interface IClass&lt;out T&gt; { }
class MyClass&lt;T&gt; : IClass&lt;T&gt; { }
</code></pre>

<p>Which would allow you to do this:</p>

<pre><code>IClass&lt;Derived&gt; a = new MyClass&lt;Derived&gt;();
IClass&lt;IMyInterface&gt; b = a;

"<p>How does Java deal with passing reference data type arguments?? Can somebody give a clear picture?</p>
","34211","","<p>Java passes a copy of the reference to the method.  The reference still points to the same instance.</p>

<p>Imagine if I had a slip of paper with a restaurant's address on it.  You also want to go to the same restaurant so I get a new slip of paper and copy the address of the restaurant on to that paper and give it to you.  Both slips of paper point to the same restaurant but they are separate <em>references</em> to the instance.</p>

<p>The restaurant itself is not duplicated, only the reference to it is duplicated.</p>

<p>Jon Skeet <a href=""http://www.yoda.arachsys.com/java/passing.html"">provides a similar analogy</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The balloon analogy</strong>   </p>
  
  <p>I imagine every
  object as a helium balloon, every
  reference as a piece of string, and
  every variable as something which can
  hold onto a piece of string. If the
  reference is a null reference, that's
  like having a piece of string without
  anything attached to the end. If it's
  a reference to a genuine object, it's
  a piece of string tied onto the
  balloon representing that object. When
  a reference is copied (either for
  variable assignment or as part of a
  method call) it's as if another piece
  of string is created attached to
  whatever the first piece of string is
  attached to. The actual piece of
  string the variable (if any) is
  holding onto doesn't go anywhere -
  it's only copied.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is an example:</p>

<pre><code>// Here I have one instance and one reference pointing to it
Object o = new Object();
// At this moment a copy of ""o"" is made and passed to ""foo""
foo(o);

void foo(Object obj) {
    // In here I have obj which is a copy of whatever
    // reference was passed to me

<li>Only conditional operators support short-circuiting, logical operators do not.</li>
<li>C#'s logical operators look just like their conditional counterparts but with one less character so a logical OR is <code>|</code> and a logical AND is <code>&amp;</code>.</li>
<li>Logical operators can be overloaded but conditional operators cannot (this is a bit of an technicality as conditional operator evaluation does involve overload resolution and this overload resolution can resolve to a custom overload of the type's logical operator, so you can work around this limitation to a certain extent).</li>

  <p>[I]t is not true that you have to

  The basic principle is that: the

  compatible with IIS settings. This
  means that if you want to enable
  transport layer authentication in the
  binding, you have to do so to the
  virtual application in IIS. For
  example, when you use
  BasicHttpBinding, you can enable the
  transport layer auth by setting the
  security Mode to
  ""TransportCredentialOnly"". You can
  disable IIS anonymous auth in this
  case.</p>
  
  <p>However, there is one special case: if
  you are using WSHttpBinding over HTTP
  instead of HTTPS, you would have to
  enable anonymous in IIS. This is
  because none of the security modes for
  WSHttpBinding allows you to configure
  transport-layer authentication over
  HTTP, which has been implemented in
  BasicHttpBinding. Of course, you can
  solve this by using either
  BasicHttpBinding or CustomBinding.
  This is not a limitation. Instead it

</code></pre>

<p>Is there a similar shorter way of removing this boilerplate in C#?</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I left a very important part out of my example: namely, the events getting implemented are part of an interface, and I want to implement it explicitly. Sorry for not mentioning this earlier!</p>
","34211","","<p>Try this:</p>

<pre><code>public class Microwave {
    public event EventHandler&lt;EventArgs&gt; DoorClosed;
    public event EventHandler&lt;EventArgs&gt; LightbulbOn;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This code leverages C#'s <a href=""http://en.csharp-online.net/ECMA-334%3a_17.7.1_Field-like_events"" rel=""nofollow"">field-like event syntax</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When compiling a field-like event, the
  compiler automatically creates storage
  to hold the delegate, and creates
  accessors for the event that add or
  remove event handlers to the delegate
  field.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In C# 1, 2, and 3 this code will compile down to just what you have above.  In C# 4 you will get functionally equivalent code that <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/cburrows/archive/2010/03/05/events-get-a-little-overhaul-in-c-4-part-i-locks.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">doesn't use explicit locks</a>.  Either way you can use this shortcut without changing the consumers of this type.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>  Unfortunately, the C# compiler does not allow you to use field-like events for explicit interface implementation.  If you try you will get this compilation error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An explicit interface implementation of an event must use event accessor syntax</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> It's too bad that an explicit interface implementation requires the use of event accessor syntax.  It would be kind of cool if C# added the ability to create automatically implemented field-like events like this:</p>

<pre><code>event EventHandler&lt;EventArgs&gt; IAppliance.DoorClosed { add; remove; }
</code></pre>

<p>But this syntax is already wordier than the existing field-like event syntax and would only be applicable in cases where an interface member was being explicitly implemented.  The best thing I think would be if the compiler would simply allow us to do this:</p>

<pre><code>event EventHandler&lt;EventArgs&gt; IAppliance.DoorClosed;

"<p>In the .NET framework, many of the System.Collection classes have <code>Clear</code> methods on them. Is there a clear advantage on using this versus replacing the reference with a new object?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
","34211","","<p>Brian is correct but to be more specific, the <code>Clear</code> method removes all items from the current instance of the collection.  Instantiating a new collection and assigning its reference to your variable will give you an entirely new instance altogether and may cause some unintended consequences depending on whether or not other people are holding a reference to the old instance.  If another thread has a reference to that collection they will still hold a reference to the old collection even though you have created a new instance.</p>

<p>The important thing here is the <code>null</code> is not zero.  At first glance you would think that <code>singleSum</code> <em>should</em> equal 17 but that would mean that we would have to assign different semantics to <code>null</code> based on the data type of the reference.

        // skip over any null values

<p>it creates a new instance of Person object on heap and so the instance is accessed by the requesting thread, unless and otherwise I spawn multiple threads in my application.</p>

","34211","","<p>If the reference to your <code>Person</code> instance is shared among multiple threads then multiple threads could potentially change <code>Address</code> causing a race condition.  However unless you are holding that reference in a static field or in Session (some sort of globally accessible place) then you don't have anything to be worried about.</p>

<p>If you are creating references to objects in your code like you have show above (<code>var p = new Person();</code>) then you are perfectly thread safe as other threads will not be able to access the reference to these objects without resorting to nasty and malicious tricks.</p>

"<p>I have recently been learning about Data Access Layers, Business Logic Layers and Presentation Layers, but I still have a few things that aren't quite clear.</p>

<p>I can use the DAL and BLL with the Presentation Layer to get or set information in a database.</p>

<p>Should I, for example, try to put a button click event into the BLL or should I just leave it in the aspx code behind file?</p>

<p>And if I should put them into the BLL how would I go about doing this?</p>

<p>Any layer should only know about and make assumptions about the layer to its immediate right.  This means that the presentation layer can talk to the business layer and use it's API but it should never talk directly to the data layer.  The business layer can use the data layer's API but it should never know about or make assumptions about the presentation layer that consumes it. And obviously the data layer should know nothing about any of the other layers.</p>

<p>If you follow this general principal you will find that your application will be simpler and easier to maintain.</p>

"<p>I have one specific query with the interfaces. By default interface methods are abstract and virtual so if we implement that interface and gives definition in the class we actually override that method but when we mark the method as a virtual again in the implementing class why the complier is not considering that we are actually trying to hide the original interface virtual method.Like if we have a virtual method in the base class and derived class again marked the method as virtual in that case compiler gives the warning that you are hiding the base class method so use new if you are intentionally hiding the base class method. </p>

<pre><code>public interface ITestInterface
{
 void virtualmethod(); // this method is by default virtual. 
}

public class TestInterface :ITestInterface
{
 public virtual void virtualmethod()
 {
// Now compiler should consider that i am actually hiding the interface virtual method.
 }
}
</code></pre>

<p>if you build the above code for interface and open in ILDASM you will see the code like this:
<code>.method public hidebysig newslot abstract virtual
         instance void virtualmethod() cil managed
{
}//end of method ITestInterface::virtualmethod
</code></p>
","34211","","<p>Methods that are implemented from an interface are <em>not</em> virtual by default.  You are simply providing an implementation of the contract defined in the interface definition.  By marking the method as <code>virtual</code> you are allowing derived classes to provide additional or separate implementation while still honoring the contract as defined.</p>

<p>Consider this example:</p>

<pre><code>interface IAnimal
{
    string Speak();
}

class Dog : IAnimal
{
    public string Speak()
    {
        return ""Bark!"";
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>Dog</code> class is <em>implementing</em> the interface by providing implementation for the contract <code>IAnimal</code>.  There are no virtual methods here and no overriding.  </p>

<p>Now consider this example:</p>

<pre><code>interface IAnimal
{
    string Speak();
}

class Dog : IAnimal
{
    public virtual string Speak()
    {
        return ""Bark!"";
    }
}

class GoldenRetriever : Dog
{
    public override string Speak()
    {
        return ""I am a golden retriever who says "" 
                   + base.Speak();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now the <code>Dog</code> class has declared <code>Speak</code> to be <code>virtual</code> which allows derived classes to provided additional or new implementation.  This does not break the contract with <code>IAnimal</code> as any call to the <code>Speak</code> method still returns a string.</p>

<p>Ok, one last example.  Remember that interfaces don't actually require an implementation - they only require that the contract is satisfied.  This means that the interface only cares that a member exists in the implementing class that has a matching signature.  This means that we could also do this:</p>

<pre><code>interface IAnimal
{
    string Speak();
}

abstract class Dog : IAnimal
{
    public abstract string Speak();
}

class GoldenRetriever : Dog
{
    public override string Speak()
    {
        return ""I am a golden retriever"";
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Notice now that the <code>Dog</code> class provides no implementation at all for <code>Speak</code> yet has satisfied the requirements of the contract.</p>

<p>Interfaces are also inherited from class to class so in all the examples above both <code>Dog</code> and <code>GoldenRetriever</code> implement the <code>IAnimal</code> interface.  Neither class <em>hide</em> the <code>Speak</code> method - both classes <em>implement</em> it.</p>

<hr>

<p>Ok, I think your confusion may be coming from the fact that the virtual method is defined in an interface, not a class.  Here is the IL for the interface I defined above:</p>

<pre><code>.class private interface abstract auto ansi IAnimal
{
    .method public hidebysig newslot abstract 
        virtual instance string Speak() cil managed
    {
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>While you are correct that the method is defined as <code>virtual</code> you also need to notice that the type here is designated as an <code>interface</code>.  This is purely an implementation detail of the MSIL generated by Microsoft's C# compiler - another compiler could easily generate different code as long as semantically it provided the same result.</p>

<p>The important thing here is this: even though the method is declared as <code>virtual</code> in the interface that does not mean that it is the same thing as a <code>virtual</code> method declared in a class.</p>

","34211","","<p>You cannot access the compiler-created backing variable - you must use the property.  The compiler-generated backing field is specifically named in such a way to prevent you from accessing it (it is not named <code>_DateOfBirth</code>, it is named something like <code>&lt;DateOfBirth&gt;k__BackingField</code>).</p>

<p>Access the property directly - if you need to manipulate the backing field directly then don't use an automatically implemented property.</p>

<p>Just a side note - it doesn't matter what the property name is (it is an implementation detail and could change on different versions of the compiler or with different compiler implementations altogether).  The field is given an identifier that is specifically designed to meet the naming restrictions of the CLR but fail the naming restrictions of C# making it impossible to ever write straight C# code that accesses that variable directly.</p>

<p>Arrays are no good because I don't know beforehand how many MyThings I will need (it could be 0, it will probably never be more than 1000). Is there a better collection for this particular usage than <code>List&lt;&gt;</code>? I don't need sorting, I only create new collections, clear existing collections, add to a collection, enumerate a collection, or process pairings as above. Whatever collection I use, I might need 100 to 10000 of them, so they can't be too costly to create/keep.</p>

","34211","","<p>You will have to generate an assembly if you want to be able to use the enumeration or class at compilation time.  Reflection happens at execution time so that won't give you intellisense.</p>

<p>This is a common problem - there are a set of distinct values in a database table and those values don't change often so they are modeled as an <code>enum</code> in the source code.  This allows these somewhat static values to be easily used in a very readable way.  The problem is that when the values do change, it would be nice if the <code>enum</code> changed as well.</p>

<p>The problem with trying to keep the <code>enum</code> and database in sync is that an automatic process doesn't change the fact that if you are changing the database it would be very unlikely that you would do so without having to roll new code to leverage the changed value.  It is better to model these values as an <code>enum</code> and still store them in the database.  Just manually sync them as the need arises.</p>

<p>1) The classes that are [] above the method name.. are they executed (i dont know what term to use here) first?

","34211","","<p>When you pass a reference type to a method, C# (by default) will pass a copy of the reference to the method.

<p>For example:</p>

}

","34211","","<p>The answer to your first question is no, there aren't really any security issues posed by exposing a user's id in the URL (as long as you have other means of authorization - don't use that id in the URL to authorize the user).  </p>

"<p>I'm a big Django user for web development, and I've grown to love the separation of code and display that popular template engines allow for (not just Django).  I'm starting some Asp.net work and I'm trying to learn the best ways to do certain things that I'm used to doing with Django.</p>

<p>What I want to do is separate some logic into another file that could be used in several places.  What I would have done in Django is create a ""snippet.html"" file that just had some template logic in it that could be included in other pages as long as the context it expected was there in the parent page.  In Asp.net it seems something I could do is use a label and set the label.Text value to something when I want to put in that logic, but then I start doing HTML in C# and that is something I want to avoid at all costs.  I can't seem to find a good idiom for separating a little chunk of asp.net logic into another file that can be included at will.</p>

  <p>The parentheses indicate that this

  <li><p>The path is specified in XAML that is in a style or template that does
  not have a specified Target Type. A

"<p>I understand why you would want to use a read-only property using the following syntax:</p>

<pre><code>private int _MyInt;
public int MyInt
{

<p>This example probably isn't the best one because I think that read-only properties really shine in conjunction with a <code>readonly</code> variable, but that's beside the point. What I don't understand is why use a write-only property using the following syntax:</p>

public int MyInt
{
  set { _MyInt = value; }
}

<p>This is how read-only properties are described in various books and tutorials. If you set the variable, you would conceptually read it at <em>some</em> point, at least internally to the class, but to read it even internally within the class you would do so by accesssing <code>_MyInt</code> which I feel violates the spirit of encapsulation which properties try to enforce. Instead, why wouldn't you just use the full power of the property with different access modifies for accessing it as such:</p>

{
  set { _MyInt = value; }
  private get { return _MyInt; }
}

<p>Which of course can just be written</p>

<p>You still get the encapsulation, but restrict other classes from access, so its still write-only to outside classes.</p>

        set { /* password encryption here */ }

</code></pre>

<p>Ugh.  This is much better:</p>

<pre><code>class User
{
    public void SetPassword(string password)
    {
        /* password encryption here */
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>See, a read/write property is a set of methods that are designed to masquerade as a field.  They look and feel like a field.  It is for this reason that a read-only property makes sense because we are used to having fields and variables that we can read but cannot change.  However there isn't a corresponding field or variable construct that is writable but not readable.</p>

<p>This is why I believe that creating an API that employs write-only properties is bad practice.  It runs counter-intuitive to what I believe is the main goal of the property syntax in C#.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> More philosophy... I believe that classes serve a functional purpose: they provide a container for related data to be held and manipulated.  Take our <code>User</code> class for example - this class will hold all pieces of information that pertain to a user in the system.  We collect all these pieces of data and give them a single name: <em>user</em>.  In this way we use classes to create <em>abstractions</em>. <code>User</code> is an abstraction that allows us to reason about all the individual pieces of data that comprise a user (password, name, birthday, etc.).</p>

<p>Now there are good abstractions and there are bad abstractions.  I believe that write-only properties are <em>bad</em> abstractions because you are allowing someone to input data and not read it.  Why would you disallow this?  Most likely because the information that has been passed in has been transformed in some way that makes it unreadable to the passer.</p>

<p>So this means that a write-only property <em>by definition</em> must create side-effects that the caller cannot see (because if they could see them then there would be no reason to make the property write-only).  The best construct in the C# language for setting a value with side-effects is the <em>method</em>.  </p>

<p>I would highly recommend not using write-only properties because consumers of your API will find them confusing and frustrating.  Even if you find a valid use-case for this syntax it doesn't justify its use.</p>

","34211","","<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>Whoa, really wierd - you asked about phone codes and I wrote about ZIP codes.  Sorry about that!  I think the advice still stands though...</em></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Original answer:</strong> Performance will most likely be negligible - assign the proper type based on <em>what</em> the data is.  ZIP codes, while numeric (in the US at least), aren't numbers - they should be stored as strings.</p>

<p>It is very important to understand the <em>semantic</em> nature of the data you are storing.  Once you understand what something is then you can begin to reason about how it should be stored.  I am assuming that currently you are storing only the first 5 numbers of a US postal code (like this: <code>12345</code>).</p>

<p>If you were to store this data as a number this would work.  Then imagine that your manager tells you that there is a new requirement that the app you are building will start to collect ZIP codes in the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_code#ZIP.2B4"" rel=""nofollow"">ZIP+4 format</a> (which looks like this: <code>12345-6789</code>).

","34211","","<p>Those are stored on the heap, with the objects themselves.  A good way to think about this is that when an object (that has value types as part of its state) is allocated on the heap, it's value types must live there as well, otherwise those value types would disappear as soon as the stack unwound for the code that created the object.</p>

"<p>Do access modifiers affect performance in C#?</p>
","34211","","<p>No, access modifiers are not considered by the runtime for execution. The only time they come into play after compilation is if you are using reflection and querying the assembly's metadata.</p>

<p>Think of access modifiers like concrete forms. They are put in place when the concrete is wet to provide form and boundaries for the wet concrete. Once the concrete is dry they are removed as they are no longer needed. Access modifiers are the concrete forms for your un-compiled code - once the code has been compiled the access modifiers are no longer a factor (even though they are part of the emitted IL).</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Maybe ""no longer a factor"" is a little vague. What I mean is that it's the compiler's job to make sure that all access modifiers are properly honored and no violations occur. The runtime (at least Microsoft's CLR - other runtimes are free to implement this any way they see fit) trusts that the compiler has done its job and no further checks are necessary.</p>

","34211","","<p>Well, one of the reasons properties exist is so that you can do stuff just like this.  Properties are a form of encapsulation that give you the ability to hide any logic that you need to hide from the caller.</p>

<p>My personal philosophy is that stuff like you have is fine (i.e. simple data manipulation that doesn't create side effects) but once the logic gets more complex than a few lines you should change over to a method to indicate to the caller that more is going on.</p>

<li>If you can't find the record, then return an exception because there's nothing that can be done.</li>
<li>If you find the record, look at the second date if it's just plain missing, then set to true because this is the first ever run. </li>
<li>Or finally get to the meat, if the first date is greater than the second set to True because it's been updated and it's time to run. Else if not, set to False because there's no update yet.</li>

However, ours are bingo cards (and probably completely unlikely to be prey to this particular situation). However, our current process is severely buggy, so I had the idea of storing the card data on my server, and allow classmates to write javascript functions in a textarea and then push a button that would just <code>eval(textarea.value)</code>. That would allow us to do some fairly useful computations on the data without too much problem. I also had the idea of ""storing procedures"" as text that they could load into the textarea and then evaluate. </p>

<p>Is this a bad area for <code>eval()</code>? Or a somewhat grey area? Also, what are some of the potential problems I could face? Obviously they could potentially bork their view of the page, but as long as I'm not doing anything stupid, a simple page reload should fix that, correct?</p>

","34211","","<p>I don't want to be melodramatic but this is probably one of the <em>worst</em> usages of <code>eval()</code> since you will be executing arbitrary, user-supplied JavaScript. This would allow a user to execute code on your domain which would make an XSS attack rediculously simple.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> On second thought maybe I am being too dramatic. As long as you aren't persisting these functions and they are simply being <code>eval</code>'d on the client's machine then you aren't really allowing anything that the user can't already do in their local JavaScript console in the browser.  Just be sure not to save these functions for other users to use later.</p>

"<p>I've just started using Backbone (and Underscore) JS. We are doing a big iPad HTML5 application and it needs to work all client side. The project needs structure and Backbone seems to be a good fit. Doesn't seem to get in the way too much and can be used as a bit of a toolkit (especially because of Underscore being needed too).</p>

<p>I have one question though. This HTML5 app is basically a Single Page Application. Everything starts from a index.html file. I've been getting to know Backbone's way of managing URL fragments, which I really like. It's easy to set up routing events to particular models.</p>

<p>This HTML5 app I'm working on has many nested layers of ""pages"" in it. There is a about three levels of nesting. That's the JSON data, which this app uses (I've yet to get into local database storage etc, but maybe I should? Just wanted to get my head around Backbone first). They are normal webpages, as such, they are just pages of content that has been loading into various parts of the webapp.</p>

<p>I've been using views. I think I have the concept... Populate a Collection with data and the View is built around this Collection of data. I understand that for a single instance of a Model it has a View to go with it. Then when you want to view the model's Collection, you can call a View that will iterate over the Collection and call each individual model's View.</p>

<p>Sorry, I know I'm not probably making much sense!</p>

<p>But basically, I see that Backbone Views are used to generate HTML for a single Model, for a model's Collection... so that's all the small views sorted for the various parts of the page, but what about a View for an entire page? Say this HTML5 app had a basic template, but different pages of the webapp needed different entire page layouts so they can look how they should? You can do this sort of thing? Basically having a View that does an Ajax call to get an entire page template?</p>

<p>The below example is a View which is called from the main Constructor when the URL is at the root of the app. There is various views like this I want to set up, which my app will need to show when the user is at various URLs. Is it wrong to load in a whole Ajax template like I am here? What other ways are there to have Single Page Application, but also have manageable page templates for all the different bits of the site?</p>

<pre><code>App.View.Home = Backbone.View.extend({
    tagName: ""article"",
    id: ""view-home"",
    initialize: function() {
        _.bindAll(this, ""render"");
    },
    render: function() {

        var that = this;

        $.get(""templates/home.html"", function(templateHtml) {
            $(that.el).html(_.template(templateHtml));

            // we want tabs in this template too
            var tabs = new App.View.Tabs();
            $(that.el).find('#main').html(tabs.render().el);

        }, ""html"");

        return that;
    },
});

<p>I'm sorry if this doesn't make much sense... I've been trying to learn so much.</p>
","34211","","<p>I don't really see anything wrong with this approach but it is difficult to say without seeing a bit more code. The important thing is not to over-think backbone too much. There are only a few things that backbone is designed to do and beyond that it's up to you to leverage that functionality as you see fit.</p>

<p>As for this particular issue I don't see any reason why you shouldn't do what you are doing here. I would definitely make sure that you aren't loading/fetching any data or templates before you need them. I would also make sure that you wait until you have all the data you need from the server before rendering a view (so the view doesn't load choppily). These last points are only guidelines and don't really have anything to do with backbone.  But honestly that's one of the <em>features</em> of backbone: it does a few things well and then gets out of your way.</p>

"<p>I'm not sure of the best way to ask this question, so I'll start with an example:</p>

<pre><code>public static void ConvertPoint(ref Point point, View fromView, View toView) {
    //Convert Point
}
</code></pre>

<p>This call is recursive.  You pass in a point, it converts it relative to <code>fromView</code> to be relative to <code>toView</code> (as long as one is an ancestor of the other).</p>

<p>The call is recursive, converting the point one level at a time.  I know, mutable structs are bad, but the reason I'm using a mutable point is so that I only need to create a single point and pass it along the recursive call, which is why I'm using ref.  Is this the right way to go, or would it be better to use an out parameter, or simply declare the method to return a point instead?</p>

<p>I'm not very familiar with how structs are handled as opposed to classes in these circumstances.  This is code being ported from Java, where point obviously had to be a class, so it made sense to use the same temporary point over and over rather than create a new point which had to be garbage collected at every call.</p>

<p>This may be a confusing question, and to heap on some more confusion, while I'm at it, should I keep a temporary static <code>Point</code> instance around for quick conversions or would it be just as simple to create a new point whenever this method is called (it's called a <em>lot</em>)?</p>
","34211","","<p>I tend to make everything a class to simplify things. If you find that this creates unwanted memory pressure in your application only then should you investigate a solution that involves a mutable struct.</p>

<p>The reason I say this is that the GC tends to be very good at optimizing collections around the needs of your app and mutable structs are a notorious headache.  Don't introduce that headache if the GC can handle the memory pressure of multiple objects.</p>

<p>Unless I missed something, however, neither of these captured issues regarding ""proper"" python file naming conventions.  After making several python scripts, I discovered that I am not supposed to use periods ( . ) in the file name, since it will make it a challenge to import them.

Python has SEVERAL aspects which make it quite unique (such as required whitespace &amp; the aforementioned disallowed periods in filenames).

"<p>I just started delving into javascript to make project more responsive and I am working through a backbone.js example.</p>

<p>I've replicated <a href=""http://www.jamesyu.org/2011/01/27/cloudedit-a-backbone-js-tutorial-by-example/"">http://www.jamesyu.org/2011/01/27/cloudedit-a-backbone-js-tutorial-by-example/</a> in a new Rails 3 project.</p>

<p>I run the project and go to the home page .... and there is a link there to /# and nothing else. Looking into the js console I get errors on two scripts: application.js and backbone.js</p>

<p>This (backbone.js)</p>

<pre><code>backbone-min-0-3-3.js:8Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'extend' of undefined
</code></pre>

<p>and this (application.js): </p>

<pre><code>var App = {
        Views: {},
        Controllers: {},
        Collections: {},
        init: function() {

        new App.Controllers.Fffforms();
**error message ---&gt; application.js:9Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function**
            Backbone.history.start();
        }
};

<p>Being new to js, this doesn't exactly make sense and nothing I've looked up has been all that helpful in the short term.</p>

<p>Can anyone tell me what exactly these errors would indicate and how I can go about following up? Everything checks out comparing the resources in

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>By suggestion, I went and actually added in the Jammit gem and configured it to serve all the js scripts, which the default Rails all was not. Now all the scripts are going to the browser (controller included). Unfortunately, this doesn't solve the original issue, only giving more errors on load, flowing from the App init which is this in the chrome js console:</p>

"<p>The book <a href=""http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596527464"">Learning JavaScript</a> defines anonymous functions as follows...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Functions are objects. As such, you can create them - just like a <code>String</code> or <code>Array</code> or other type - by using a constructor and assigning the function to a variable. In the following code, a new function is created using the <code>Function</code> constructor, with the function body and argument passed in as arguments:</p>

<pre><code>var sayHi = new Function(""toWhom"", ""alert('Hi' + toWhom);"");

  <p>This type of function is often referred to as an <em>anonymous function</em> because the function itself isn't directly declared or named.</p>

","34211","","<p>Keep in mind that <code>fetch</code> is an asynchronous call to the server. To make your code work as you expected, create a <code>success</code> function that <code>Backbone.Collection</code> can call once it refreshes its contents from the server:</p>

coll.fetch();

<p>For example, this would be the function call in PHP:</p>

<p><code>&lt;a href=""&lt;?= SEO::CreateLink('blog/post.php?post=123&amp;category=5') ?&gt;"" title=""Blog Post Title""&gt;Blog Post Title&lt;/a&gt;</code></p>

<p>The function <code>CreateLink</code> would then analyse the string passed in, and output something like this:</p>

<p><code>blog/blog-post-title</code></p>

<p>The URL stub of the blog post is stored in the Database already. I think the best way to achieve this is to analyse the dynamic URL string passed in, and generate an associative array to be analysed. My question is, what would the Regular Expression be to take the URL and produce the following associative array in PHP?</p>

<pre><code>link_pieces['page_type'] = 'blog/post';
link_pieces['post'] = 123;
link_pieces['category'] = 5;
</code></pre>

<p>Where <code>page_type</code> is the base directory and request page without extension, and the other array values are the request vars?</p>

"<p>Hi I have a list of users. Each User belongs to an Area.</p>

<p>What I'm wanting to do with this list is create a dictionary from them where the Area Name is the Key and the value for the key is a selectList of Users in the Area the with a Text value of the Username and a Value set to the User Id.</p>

<p>I managed to achieve this using the following code:</p>

<pre><code>    var StaffByArea = new Dictionary&lt;string, IEnumerable&lt;SelectListItem&gt;&gt;();

    foreach(var area in areas)) {
                        var personList = new List&lt;SelectListItem&gt;();

"<p>I have a <code>List&lt;MyRichObject&gt;</code> with 50 instances in it. Each of the instances has 1 or 2 unique properties, but in a way they are all unique because there is only one at position in the list, etc.</p>

<p>I would like to come up with a unique way to ""hash"" this List so it is unique from all of the other Lists. Is there a smart way to do that in .NET 4?</p>

<p>The purpose is to create a kind of ""monniker"" for the Lists so they can be dumped into a queue and found later based on their unique value.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
","34211","","<p>Does the hash have to be representative of the list's contents? In other words will you use the hash to determine potential equality?  If not then just create a new Guid and use that.</p>

<p>If the identifier does need to represent the contents of the list then you can either generate a hashcode based on the contents of the list (this will be inefficient as you will be unable to cache this value as the list's contents may change) or forgo the hash altogether and use <code>Enumerable.SequenceEquals</code> to determine equality.</p>

<hr>

<p>Here is an example of how I would implement getting a hash code for a <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code>. First of all, if you are going to get a hash code for a particular object your really ought to make sure that object will not change. If that object does change then your hash code is no longer any good.</p>

<p>The best way to work with a list that can be ""frozen"" (meaning no items added or removed after a certain point) is to call <code>AsReadOnly</code>. This will give you a <code>ReadOnlyCollection&lt;T&gt;</code>. The implementation below hinges on a <code>ReadOnlyCollection&lt;T&gt;</code> just to be safe so keep that in mind:</p>

<pre><code>using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Collections.ObjectModel;
using System.Linq;

    static void Main()
    {
        var seqOne = new List&lt;int&gt; { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 };
        var seqTwo = new List&lt;int&gt; { 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 };

        var seqOneCode = seqOne.AsReadOnly().GetSequenceHashCode();
        var seqTwoCode = seqTwo.AsReadOnly().GetSequenceHashCode();

        Console.WriteLine(seqOneCode == seqTwoCode);
    }

In all other browsers it is fine, I can see the difference in the counter after removing the linebreaks in javascript. Only in ie it doesn't change a thing.

"<p>I want to create a dictionary of factory objects that can be used for dependency injection.</p>

<p>For Example, say that I have a static class called ServiceLocator.   An application could use:</p>

<pre><code>ITest test = ServiceLocator&lt;ITest&gt;.GetInstance()
</code></pre>

<p>to get an object implementing the ITest interface.</p>

<p>To implement this I first created an Interface IFactory</p>

<pre><code>public interface IFactory&lt;T&gt;
{

<p>I can think of ways around this by, for example defining IFactory instead of IFactory:</p>

<pre><code>public interface IFactory
{
  object GetInstance();

<p>but then the user would need to cast the object themselves:</p>

<pre><code>ITest test = (ITest)ServiceLocator&lt;ITest&gt;.GetInstance();
</code></pre>

<p>which is rather awkward and could lead to errors (e.g. not casting it correctly)</p>

","34211","","<p>Try this:</p>

<pre><code>if(new [] {""a"", ""b"", ""c""}.Contains(aString))  
    Console.Out.WriteLine(""aString is 'a', 'b' or 'c'"");
</code></pre>

<p>This uses the <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb352880.aspx""><code>Contains</code></a> method to search the array for <code>aString</code>.</p>

"<p>I would like to use something like this:</p>

<pre><code>Dictionary&lt;int, string&gt;[] matrix = new Dictionary&lt;int, string&gt;[2];
</code></pre>

<p>But, when I do:</p>

<pre><code>matrix[0].Add(0, ""first str"");
</code></pre>

<p>It throws "" 'TargetInvocationException '...Exception has been thrown by the target of an invocation.""</p>

<p>What is the problem?  Am I using that array of dictionaries correctly?</p>
","34211","","<p>Try this:</p>

<pre><code>Dictionary&lt;int, string&gt;[] matrix = new Dictionary&lt;int, string&gt;[] 
{
    new Dictionary&lt;int, string&gt;(),
    new Dictionary&lt;int, string&gt;()
};

<p>You need to instantiate the dictionaries inside the array before you can use them.</p>

"<p>I have a form with id ""theForm"" which has the following div with a submit button inside:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""placeOrder"" style=""text-align: right; width: 100%; background-color: white;""&gt;
   &lt;button type=""submit"" class='input_submit' style=""margin-right: 15px;"" onClick=""placeOrder()""&gt;Place Order&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>When clicked, the function ""placeOrder()"" is called. The function changes the innerHTML of the above div to be ""processing ..."" (so the submit button is now gone). </p>

<p>The above works, but the problem is that I now can't get the form to submit! I've tried putting this in the placeOrder() function:</p>

<pre><code>document.theForm.submit();
</code></pre>

<p>But that doesn't work.</p>

<p>How can I get the form to submit?</p>
","34211","","<p>Set the <code>name</code> attribute of your form to <code>""theForm""</code> and your code will work.</p>

"<p>This has a potentially simple answer but I can't figure it out - </p>

<pre><code>double Result = 1 / 12;
</code></pre>

<p>returns 0, while</p>

<pre><code>double Result2 = 24 / 12;
</code></pre>

<p>return 2</p>

<p>What's going on and how can I fix it?</p>
","34211","","<p>Try this:</p>

<pre><code>double Result = 1 / (double)12;
</code></pre>

<p>or this:</p>

<pre><code>double Result = 1 / 12D;
</code></pre>

<p>In C# (and also in a lot of other languages), integer division returns an integer. By casting one of the operands to <code>double</code> or explicitly declaring a literal <code>double</code> you can force the division expression to return a <code>double</code> and not truncate after the decimal place.</p>
"
"<p>Alright, i need to make a string defined as rootString that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>F:0.0
</code></pre>

<p>The letter F is derived from a previous string, obtained by:</p>

<pre><code>root = str(newickString[-1])
</code></pre>

<p>And the float 0.0 can be as such:</p>

<pre><code>rootD = 0.0
</code></pre>

<p>My question is, how do I combine both variable name and float value with a colon?</p>
","34211","","<p>Try this:</p>

<pre><code>'%s:%0.1f' % (root, rootD)

"<p>I know that this operator does the ""AND logical operator"" but I don't know how to deal with it and if it deals with decimal numbers or just binary numbers ?</p>
","34211","","<p>It is the the <a href=""http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/boolean/""><code>XOR</code> operator</a>:</p>

  <p><strong>XOR (Exclusive Or)</strong>  </p>
  
  <p>This operation is performed between two bits (a and b). The result is
  1 if either one of the two bits is 1, but not in the case that both

","34211","","<p>Backbone does not require that you create your models inside your views - you can (and often should) create your models independently of your views so that they can be shared. Also, just because you create a model inside a view doesn't mean you can't pass a reference to that model to another view and share it that way.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Polymorphism is often referred to as the third pillar of
  object-oriented programming, after encapsulation and inheritance.
  Polymorphism is a Greek word that means ""many-shaped"" and it has two
  distinct aspects:</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li><p>At run time, objects of a derived class may be treated as objects of a
  base class in places such as method parameters and collections or
  arrays. When this occurs, the object's declared type is no longer
  identical to its run-time type.</p></li>
  <li><p><em><strong>Base classes may define and implement virtual methods, and derived
  classes can override them, which means they provide their own
  definition and implementation. At run-time, when client code calls the
  method, the CLR looks up the run-time type of the object, and invokes
  that override of the virtual method. Thus in your source code you can
  call a method on a base class, and cause a derived class's version of
  the method to be executed.</em></strong></p></li>
  </ol>

"<p>I'm wondering if there's any convention preference against setting default boolean values as true or false. Maybe its beyond the scope of ActiveRecord and is more a general db design question.</p>

<p>Is it better to have a migration with <code>:active, :boolean, default: true</code> or <code>:inactive, :boolean, default: false</code> ?</p>
","34211","","<p>In my experience (Rails or otherwise), boolean attributes are most easily understood when they are phrased in the positive.</p>

<p>If you think about your example, you are really choosing between ""active"" and ""not active"". Choosing ""inactive"" (which again, is really just ""not active"") makes the code harder to read since I have to mentally negate the word ""active"" to understand what the code is doing.</p>

:active, :boolean, default: true

# New records will be not ""not active"" by default.
:inactive, :boolean, default: false

"<p>I'm quite new to C# and currently developing an application using the EntityFramework. I would like to extend the functionality of the database context class, so that I can call a method getPool() so that it hands out the according DbSet member of the class.</p>

<p>I need to implement it as a template as it will be later called from other templates, which are just knowing about the (global) database context object and a type T (having a given superclass) for which they shall query the database.</p>

<p>Here is what I tried (a bit simplified - original example is too complicated):</p>

<pre><code>public class TestContext : DbContext
{
    public DbSet&lt;TestA&gt; ATests { get; set; }
    public DbSet&lt;TestB&gt; BTests { get; set; }

    public IQueryable&lt;T&gt; getPool&lt;T&gt;() where T : TestA {
       return (IQueryable&lt;T&gt;)ATests;
    }
    public IQueryable&lt;T&gt; getPool&lt;T&gt;() where T : TestB {
       return (IQueryable&lt;T&gt;)BTests;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The error message is</p>

<p><strong>Error: Type '...' already defines a member called '...' with the same parameter types</strong>.</p>

<p>And it occurs at the line of the second specialized definition of my template (<code>public IQueryable&lt;T&gt; getPool&lt;T&gt;() where T : TestB</code>).</p>

<p>The question is: How to fix this?</p>
","34211","","<p>Unfortunately, in C#, you cannot overload a method by using a generic type constraint like this. You will have to give them different names like this</p>

<pre><code>public class TestContext : DbContext
{
    public DbSet&lt;TestA&gt; ATests { get; set; }
    public DbSet&lt;TestB&gt; BTests { get; set; }

    public IQueryable&lt;T&gt; getPoolA&lt;T&gt;() where T : TestA {
       return (IQueryable&lt;T&gt;)ATests;
    }
    public IQueryable&lt;T&gt; getPoolB&lt;T&gt;() where T : TestB {
       return (IQueryable&lt;T&gt;)BTests;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Another solution would be to do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class TestContext : DbContext
{
    public DbSet&lt;TestA&gt; ATests { get; set; }
    public DbSet&lt;TestB&gt; BTests { get; set; }

    public IQueryable&lt;T&gt; getPool&lt;T&gt;() {
       return (typeof(T) == typeof(TestA))
                  ? (IQueryable&lt;T&gt;)ATests
                  : (IQueryable&lt;T&gt;)BTests;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, you can make this even cleaner, since <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb351562.aspx"" rel=""nofollow""><code>IQueryable&lt;T&gt;</code></a> is covariant in <code>T</code>, you can avoid casting:</p>

<pre><code>public class TestContext : DbContext
{
    public DbSet&lt;TestA&gt; ATests { get; set; }
    public DbSet&lt;TestB&gt; BTests { get; set; }

    public IQueryable&lt;T&gt; getPool&lt;T&gt;() {
       return (typeof(T) == typeof(TestA)) ? ATests : BTests;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>If you want to avoid testing for types you can do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class TestContext : DbContext
{
    readonly Dictionary&lt;Type, object&gt; _sets;

    public DbSet&lt;TestA&gt; ATests { get; set; }
    public DbSet&lt;TestB&gt; BTests { get; set; }

    public TestContext()
    {
        _sets = new Dictionary&lt;Type, object&gt;
        {
            { typeof(TestA), ATests },
            { typeof(TestB), BTests }
        }
    }

    public IQueryable&lt;T&gt; getPool&lt;T&gt;() {
       return (IQueryable&lt;T&gt;)_sets[typeof(T)];
    }
}
</code></pre>
"
"<p>If I have two classes, <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> where B derives from A:</p>

<pre><code>class A {}

<p>I can upcast quite happily an instance of <code>B</code> to <code>A</code>.</p>

<pre><code>B b = new B();
A a = b;
</code></pre>

<p>Now, I can understand how the runtime can determine that the underlying type is B, as page 132 of the <a href=""http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-335.pdf"">ECMA-335</a> (Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) Partitions I to VI) states</p>

  capabilities</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, how does the runtime know that although the underlying type is <code>B</code> it is in fact stored in an <code>A</code>. I know for a fact that I won't see the methods available on <code>B</code>, but if the underlying type is <code>B</code>, how does it store the type of the storage location <code>A</code>?</p>

<p>Does that make sense? </p>
","34211","","<p>The actual type of the object is always stored with the object itself on the heap. A reference that points to that object can be of a different type as long as that type is assignable from the actual type (e.g. a base class or an implemented interface of that type).</p>
