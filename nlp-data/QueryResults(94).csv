"<p>Since debate without meaningful terms is <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24270/whats-the-point-of-oop"" rel=""nofollow"">meaningless</a>, I figured I would point at the elephant in the room and ask: What exactly makes a language ""object-oriented""? I'm not looking for a textbook answer here, but one based on your experiences with OO languages that work well in your domain, whatever it may be.</p>

<p>A related question that might help to answer first is: What is the archetype of object-oriented languages and why?</p>
","2988","jwmittag","<p><a href=""http://C2.Com/cgi/wiki?DefinitionsForOo"">Definitions for Object-Orientation</a> are of course a <a href=""http://C2.Com/cgi/wiki?OoBestFeatures"">huge can of worms</a>, but here are my 2 cents:</p>

<p>To me, Object-Orientation is all about objects that collaborate by sending messages. That is, to me, the single most important trait of an object-oriented language.</p>

<p>If I had to put up an ordered list of all the features that an object-oriented language must have, it would look like this:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href=""http://C2.com/cgi/wiki?MessagePassing"">Objects sending messages to other objects</a></li>
<li>Everything is an Object</li>
<li><a href=""http://C2.Com/cgi/wiki?LateBinding"">Late Binding</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://C2.Com/cgi/wiki?PolyMorphism"">Subtype Polymorphism</a></li>
<li>Inheritance or something similarly expressive, like <a href=""http://C2.Com/cgi/wiki?DelegationInheritance"">Delegation</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://C2.com/cgi/wiki?EncapsulationDefinition"">Encapsulation</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://C2.com/cgi/wiki?InformationHiding"">Information Hiding</a></li>
<li>Abstraction</li>
</ol>

<p>Obviously, this list is very controversial, since it excludes a great variety of languages that are widely regarded as object-oriented, such as <a href=""http://Java.Com/"">Java</a>, <a href=""http://MSDN.Microsoft.Com/vcsharp/"">C#</a> and <a href=""http://Open-Std.Org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/"">C++</a>, all of which violate points 1, 2 and 3. However, there is no doubt that those languages allow for object-oriented programming (but so does <a href=""http://Open-Std.Org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/"">C</a>) and even facilitate it (which C doesn't). So, I have come to call languages that satisfy those requirements ""purely object-oriented"".</p>

<p>As archetypical object-oriented languages I would name <a href=""http://Research.Sun.Com/self/"">Self</a> and <a href=""http://NewspeakLanguage.Org/"">Newspeak</a>.</p>

<p>Both satisfy the above-mentioned requirements. Both are inspired by and successors to <a href=""http://Smalltalk.Org/"">Smalltalk</a>, and both actually manage to be ""more OO"" in some sense. The things that I like about Self and Newspeak are that both take the message sending paradigm to the extreme (Newspeak even more so than Self).</p>

<p>In Newspeak, <em>everything</em> is a message send. There are no instance variables, no fields, no attributes, no constants, no class names. They are all emulated by using getters and setters.</p>

<p>In Self, there are <em>no classes</em>, only objects. This emphasizes, what OO is <em>really</em> about: objects, not classes.</p>

"<p>Using the same <strong>sort</strong> command with the same input produces different results on different machines.  How do I fix that?</p>
","2988","jwmittag","<p>For more than you ever wanted to know about <code>sort</code>, read the <a href=""http://OpenGroup.Org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/sort.html"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""sort"">specification of <code>sort</code></a> in the <a href=""http://OpenGroup.Org/onlinepubs/009695399/"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""Single Unix Specification v3"">Single Unix Specification v3</a>. It states</p>

<blockquote>

<p>IOW, how <code>sort</code> sorts is dependent on the locale (language) settings of the environment that the script is running under.</p>

"<p>Is it possible to undo the changes caused by the following:</p>

<pre><code>git reset --hard HEAD~1
</code></pre>
","2988","jwmittag","<p>If you have not yet garbage collected your repository (e.g. using <code>git repack -d</code> or <code>git gc</code>, but note that garbage collection can also happen automatically), then your commit is still there – it's just no longer reachable through the HEAD.</p>

<p>You can try to find your commit by looking through the output of <code>git fsck --lost-found</code>.</p>

<p>Newer versions of Git have something called the ""reflog"", which is a log of all changes that are made to the refs (as opposed to changes that are made to the repository contents). So, for example, every time you switch your HEAD (i.e. every time you do a <code>git checkout</code> to switch branches) that will be logged. And, of course, your <code>git reset</code> also manipulated the HEAD, so it was also logged. You can access older states of your refs in a similar way that you can access older states of your repository, by using an <code>@</code> sign instead of a <code>~</code>, like <code>git reset HEAD@{1}</code>.</p>

<p>It took me a while to understand what the difference is between HEAD@{1} and HEAD~1, so here is a little explanation:</p>

<pre><code>git init
git commit --allow-empty -mOne
git commit --allow-empty -mTwo
git checkout -b anotherbranch
git commit --allow-empty -mThree
git checkout master # This changes the HEAD, but not the repository contents
git show HEAD~1 # =&gt; One
git show HEAD@{1} # =&gt; Three
git reflog
</code></pre>

<p>So, <code>HEAD~1</code> means ""go to the commit before the commit that HEAD currently points at"", while <code>HEAD@{1}</code> means ""go to the commit that HEAD pointed at before it pointed at where it currently points at"".</p>

<p>That will easily allow you to find your lost commit and recover it.</p>

"<p>The log4j network adapter sends events as a serialised java object. I would like to be able to capture this object and deserialise it in a different language (python). Is this possible?</p>

<p><em>NOTE</em> The network capturing is easy; its just a TCP socket and reading in a stream. The difficulty is the deserialising part</p>
","2988","jwmittag","<p><em>Theoretically</em>, it's possible. The Java Serialization, like pretty much everything in Javaland, is standardized. So, you <em>could</em> implement a deserializer according to that standard in Python. However, the Java Serialization format is not designed for cross-language use, the serialization format is closely tied to the way objects are represented inside the JVM. While implementing a JVM in Python is surely a fun exercise, it's probably not what you're looking for (-:</p>

<p>There are other (data) serialization formats that are specifically designed to be language agnostic. They usually work by stripping the data formats down to the bare minimum (number, string, sequence, dictionary and that's it) and thus requiring a bit of work on both ends to represent a rich object as a graph of dumb data structures (and vice versa).</p>

<p>Two examples are <a href=""http://JSON.Org/"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)"">JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)</a> and <a href=""http://YAML.Org/"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language)"">YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language)</a>.</p>

<p><a href=""http://ASN1.Elibel.Tm.Fr/en/"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One)"">ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One)</a> is another data serialization format. Instead of dumbing the format down to a point where it can be easily understood, ASN.1 is self-describing, meaning all the information needed to decode a stream is encoded within the stream itself.</p>

<p>And, of course, <a href=""http://W3.Org/XML/"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""XML (eXtensible Markup Language)"">XML (eXtensible Markup Language)</a>, will work too, provided that it is not just used to provide textual representation of a ""memory dump"" of a Java object, but an actual abstract, language-agnostic encoding.</p>

<p>So, to make a long story short: your best bet is to either try to coerce log4j into logging in one of the above-mentioned formats, replace log4j with something that does that or try to somehow intercept the objects before they are sent over the wire and convert them before leaving Javaland.</p>

<p>Libraries that implement JSON, YAML, ASN.1 and XML are available for both Java and Python (and pretty much every programming language known to man).</p>

"<p>Since I got a quick response on the last Ruby <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29511/ruby-convert-integer-to-string"" rel=""nofollow"">question</a> I asked, I have another one that's been bothering me. Is there a one line function call that quits the program and displays a message? I know in Perl its as simple as this:</p>

<pre><code>die(""Message goes here"")
</code></pre>

<p>Essentially I'm just tired of typing this:</p>

<pre><code>puts ""Message goes here""
exit
</code></pre>
","2988","jwmittag","<p>If you want to denote an actual error in your code, you could raise a <code>RuntimeError</code> exception:</p>

<pre><code>raise RuntimeError, 'Message goes here'
</code></pre>

<p>This will print a stacktrace, the type of the exception being raised and the message that you provided. Depending on your users, a stacktrace might be too scary, and the actual message might get lost in the noise. On the other hand, if you die because of an actual error, a stacktrace will give you additional information for debugging.</p>

"<p>I need to match and remove all tags using a regular expression in Perl.  I have the following:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;\\??(?!p).+?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But this still matches with the closing <code>&lt;/p&gt;</code> tag.  Any hint on how to match with the closing tag as well?</p>

<p>Note, this is being performed on xhtml.</p>
","2988","jwmittag","<p>In my opinion, trying to parse HTML with anything other than an HTML parser is just asking for a world of pain. HTML is a <em>really</em> complex language (which is one of the major reasons that XHTML was created, which is much simpler than HTML).</p>

<p>For example, this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;HTML /
  &lt;HEAD /
    &lt;TITLE / &gt; /
    &lt;P / &gt;
</code></pre>

<p>is a complete, 100% well-formed, 100% valid HTML document. (Well, it's missing the DOCTYPE declaration, but other than that ...)</p>

<p>It is semantically equivalent to</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;
      &amp;gt;
    &lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But it's nevertheless valid HTML that you're going to have to deal with. You <em>could</em>, of course, devise a regex to parse it, but, as others already suggested, using an actual HTML parser is just sooo much easier.</p>

"<p>Can anyone point me to a good tutorial on creating a bootable Linux CD from scratch?</p>

<p>I need help with a fairly specialized problem: my firm sells an expansion card that requires custom firmware. Currently we use an extremely old live CD image of RH7.2 that we update with current firmware. Manufacturing puts the cards in a machine, boots off the CD, the CD writes the firmware, they power off and pull the cards. Because of this cycle, it's essential that the CD boot and shut down as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>The problem is that with the next generation of cards, I have to update the CD to a 2.6 kernel. It's easy enough to acquire a pre-existing live CD - but those all are designed for showing off Linux on the desktop - which means they take forever to boot.</p>

<p>Can anyone fix me up with a current How-To?</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<h3>Update:</h3>

<p>So, just as a final update for anyone reading this later - the tool I ended up using was ""livecd-creator"".</p>

<p>My reason for choosing this tool was that it is available for RedHat-based distributions like CentOs, Fedora and RHEL - which are all distributions that my company supports already. In addition, while the project is very poorly documented it is extremely customizable. I was able to create a minimal LiveCD and edit the boot sequence so that it booted directly into the firmware updater instead of a bash shell.</p>

<p>The whole job would have only taken an hour or two if there had been a README explaining the configuration file!</p>
","2988","jwmittag","<p>There are a couple of interesting projects you could look into.</p>

<p>But first: does it have to be a CD-ROM? That's probably the slowest possible storage (well, apart from tape, maybe) you could use. What about a fast USB stick or a an IEE1394 hard-disk or maybe even an eSATA hard-disk?</p>

<p>Okay, there are several Live-CDs that are designed to be very small, in order to e.g. fit on a business card sized CD. Some were also designed to be booted from a USB stick, back when that meant 64-128 MiByte: <a href=""http://DamnSmallLinux.Org/"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""Damn Small Linux"">Damn Small Linux</a> is one of the best known ones, however it uses a 2.4 kernel. There is a sister project called <a href=""http://DamnSmallLinux.Org/dsl-n/"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""Damn Small Linux - Not"">Damn Small Linux - Not</a>, which has a 2.6 kernel (although it seems it hasn't been updated in years).</p>

<p>Another project worth noting is <a href=""http://grml.org/"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""grml"">grml</a>, a Live-CD for system administration tasks. It does not boot into a graphic environment, and is therefore quite fast; however, it still contains about 2 GiByte of software compressed onto a CD-ROM. But it also has a smaller flavor, aptly named <a href=""http://grml.org/faq/#whatissmall"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""grml-small"">grml-small</a>, which only contains about 200 MiByte of software compressed into 60 MiByte.</p>

<p>Then there is <a href=""http://Morphix.Org/"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""Morphix"">Morphix</a>, which is a Live-CD builder toolkit based on <a href=""http://Knoppix.De/"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""Knoppix"">Knoppix</a>. (""Morphable Knoppix""!) Morphix is basically a tool to build your own special purpose Live-CD.</p>

<p>The last thing I want to mention is <a href=""http://MachBoot.Com/"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""MachBoot"">MachBoot</a>. MachBoot is a super-fast Live-CD. It uses various techniques to massively speed up the boot process. I believe they even trace the order in which blocks are accessed during booting and then remaster the ISO so that those blocks are laid out contiguously on the medium. Their current record is less than 6 seconds to boot into a full graphical desktop environment. However, this also seems to be stale.</p>

"<p>I'm considering developing a website similar to stackoverflow, but the answers may also consist of drawings (schematics, in this case).  I want to have an area in the answer form where they can make this schematic without requiring special plugins, etc.  </p>

<li>Are we to the point where SVG has or should have critical mass soon (1-2 years) such that designing a website where script-run SVG as a primary feature is reasonable (ie, requiring Firefox or another SVG/AJAX compliant browser)?</li>
<li>What are some good resources for learning cross platform SVG scripting (likely in javascript)?</li>
</ol>

<p>-Adam Davis</p>
","2988","jwmittag","<p>Unfortunately, I don't have an answer, but I do have three pointers to projects that you could look at.</p>

<p>The first is the <a href=""http://Research.Sun.Com/projects/lively/"">Lively Kernel</a> by Dan Ingalls (yes, <em>the</em> Dan Ingalls) at Sun Labs. It is an implementation of a Smalltalk Virtual World in JavaScript on top of SVG. More precisely, it is an implementation of the Morphic GUI framework from Squeak Smalltalk in JavaScript using SVG and a port of (parts of) Squeak Smalltalk in JavaScript.</p>

<p>Or, if you're not a Smalltalker and the above doesn't make sense to you: it's an Operating System, written in JavaScript with the JavaScript interpreter as the CPU, SVG as the graphics card and the browser as the computer.</p>

<p>This is about as extreme as it gets, when it comes to JavaScript and SVG. And it only <em>fully</em> works in Safari 3 and partly in Firefox 3, although there is an experimental port to Internet Explorer as well.</p>

<p>The second project is John Resig's <a href=""http://EJohn.Org/blog/processingjs/"">Processing.js</a> port of the Processing visualization language to JavaScript. It uses the <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element instead of SVG precisely because of the problems that you mentioned. This one however, only works in Firefox 3.</p>

<p>The third one is <a href=""http://UselessPickles.Com/triangles/demo.html"">Real-Time 3D in JavaScript</a> by Useless Pickles. It uses <em>only</em> JavaScript, DOM and CSS and <em>no</em> SVG or <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> or Flash or whatever. <em>And</em> it is portable to almost any browser, including Internet Explorer 7 and up. Doing 2D should be even easier than this.</p>

<p>Between those three projects you should be able to find some inspiration and also to find some people who tried to push the envelope with JavaScript and SVG or JavaScript and Graphics and can tell you what works and what doesn't.</p>

<p>Conclusion: doing cross-browser SVG or cross-browser <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> is nigh impossible, but with a little bit of craziness, cross-browser graphics <em>without</em> SVG or <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> is possible.</p>

"<p>Here's a perfect example of the problem: <a href=""http://blog.teksol.info/2009/03/27/argumenterror-on-number-sum-when-using-classifier-bayes.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Classifier gem breaks Rails</a>.</p>

<p>** Original question: **</p>

<p>One thing that concerns me as a security professional is that Ruby doesn't have a parallel of Java's package-privacy.  That is, this isn't valid Ruby:</p>

<pre><code>public module Foo
  public module Bar
    # factory method for new Bar implementations
    def self.new(...)
      SimpleBarImplementation.new(...)
    end
    def baz
      raise NotImplementedError.new('Implementing Classes MUST redefine #baz')
    end
  end

  private class SimpleBarImplementation
    include Bar
    def baz
      ...
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>It'd be really nice to be able to prevent monkey-patching of Foo::BarImpl.  That way, people who rely on the library know that nobody has messed with it.  Imagine if somebody changed the implementation of MD5 or SHA1 on you!  I can call <code>freeze</code> on these classes, but I have to do it on a class-by-class basis, and other scripts might modify them before I finish securing my application if I'm not <strong>very</strong> careful about load order.</p>

<p>Java provides lots of other tools for defensive programming, many of which are not possible in Ruby.  (See Josh Bloch's book for a good list.)  Is this really a concern?  Should I just stop complaining and use Ruby for lightweight things and not hope for ""enterprise-ready"" solutions?</p>

<p>(And no, core classes are not frozen by default in Ruby.  See below:)</p>

<pre><code>require 'md5'
# =&gt; true
MD5.frozen?
# =&gt; false
</code></pre>
","2988","jwmittag","<p>I don't think this is a concern.</p>

<p>Yes, the mythical ""somebody"" can replace the implementation of MD5 with something insecure. But in order to do that, the mythical somebody must actually be able to get his code into the Ruby process. And if he can do that, then he presumably could also inject his code into a Java process and e.g. rewrite the bytecode for the MD5 operation. Or just intercept the keypresses and not actually bother with fiddling with the cryptography code at all.</p>

<p>One of the typical concerns is: I'm writing this awesome library, which is supposed to be used like so:</p>

<pre><code>require 'awesome'
# Do something awesome.
</code></pre>

<p>But what if someone uses it like so:</p>

<pre><code>require 'evil_cracker_lib_from_russian_pr0n_site'
# Overrides crypto functions and sends all data to mafia
require 'awesome'
# Now everything is insecure because awesome lib uses 
# cracker lib instead of builtin
</code></pre>

<p>And the simple solution is: don't do that! Educate your users that they shouldn't run untrusted code they downloaded from obscure sources in their security critical applications. And if they do, they probably deserve it.</p>

<p>To come back to your Java example: it's true that in Java you can make your crypto code <code>private</code> and <code>final</code> and what not. However, someone can <em>still</em> replace your crypto implementation! In fact, someone actually did: many open-source Java implementations use OpenSSL to implement their cryptographic routines. And, as you probably know, Debian shipped with a broken, insecure version of OpenSSL for years. So, all Java programs running on Debian for the past couple of years actually <em>did</em> run with insecure crypto!</p>

"<p>I mostly use Java and generics are relatively new. I keep reading that Java made the wrong decision or that .NET has better implementations etc. etc.</p>

<p>So, what are the main differences between C++, C#, Java in generics? Pros/cons of each?</p>
","2988","jwmittag","<p>There are already a lot of good answers on <em>what</em> the differences are, so let me give a slightly different perspective and add the <em>why</em>.</p>

<p>As was already explained, the main difference is <em>type erasure</em>, i.e. the fact that the Java compiler erases the generic types and they don't end up in the generated bytecode. However, the question is: why would anyone do that? It doesn't make sense! Or does it?</p>

<p>Well, what's the alternative? If you don't implement generics in the language, where <em>do</em> you implement them? And the answer is: in the Virtual Machine. Which breaks backwards compatibility.</p>

<p>Type erasure, on the other hand, allows you to mix generic clients with non-generic libraries. In other words: code that was compiled on Java 5 can still be deployed to Java 1.4.</p>

<p>Microsoft, however, decided to break backwards compatibility for generics. <em>That's</em> why .NET Generics are ""better"" than Java Generics.</p>

<p>Of course, Sun aren't idiots or cowards. The reason why they ""chickened out"", was that Java was significantly older and more widespread than .NET when they introduced generics. (They were introduced roughly at the same time in both worlds.) Breaking backwards compatibility would have been a huge pain.</p>

<p>Put yet another way: in Java, Generics are a part of the <em>Language</em> (which means they apply <em>only</em> to Java, not to other languages), in .NET they are part of the <em>Virtual Machine</em> (which means they apply to <em>all</em> languages, not just C# and Visual Basic.NET).</p>

<p>Compare this with .NET features like LINQ, lambda expressions, local variable type inference, anonymous types and expression trees: these are all <em>language</em> features. That's why there are subtle differences between VB.NET and C#: if those features were part of the VM, they would be the same in <em>all</em> languages. But the CLR hasn't changed: it's still the same in .NET 3.5 SP1 as it was in .NET 2.0. You can compile a C# program that uses LINQ with the .NET 3.5 compiler and still run it on .NET 2.0, provided that you don't use any .NET 3.5 libraries. That would <em>not</em> work with generics and .NET 1.1, but it <em>would</em> work with Java and Java 1.4.</p>

"<p>I know about the ""cooperative"" threading of ruby using <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_threads"">green threads</a>. How can I create real ""OS-level"" threads in my application in order to make use of multiple cpu cores for processing?</p>
","2988","jwmittag","<p><strong>Updated with Jörg's Sept 2011 comment</strong></p>

<p>You seem to be confusing two <em>very</em> different things here: the 
Ruby Programming Language and the specific threading model of one 
specific implementation of the Ruby Programming Language. There 
are currently around 11 different implementations of the Ruby 
Programming Language, with <em>very</em> different and unique threading 
models.</p>

<p>(Unfortunately, only two of those 11 implementations are actually 
ready for production use, but by the end of the year that number 
will probably go up to four or five.) (<strong>Update</strong>: it's now 5: MRI, JRuby, YARV (the interpreter for Ruby 1.9), Rubinius and IronRuby).</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The first implementation doesn't actually have a name, which 
makes it quite awkward to refer to it and is really annoying and 
confusing. It is most often referred to as ""Ruby"", which is even 
more annoying and confusing than having no name, because it 
leads to endless confusion between the features of the Ruby 
Programming Language and a particular Ruby Implementation.</p>

<p>It is also sometimes called ""MRI"" (for ""Matz's Ruby 
Implementation""), CRuby or MatzRuby.</p>

<p><a href=""http://RedMine.Ruby-Lang.Org/repositories/annotate/ruby-18/ext/thread/thread.c"">MRI implements Ruby Threads as Green Threads within its 
interpreter</a>. Unfortunately, it doesn't allow those threads 
to be scheduled in parallel, they can only run one thread at a 
time.</p>

<p>However, any number of C Threads (POSIX Threads etc.) can run 
in parallel to the Ruby Thread, so external C Libraries, or MRI 
C Extensions that create threads of their own can still run in 
parallel.</p></li>
<li><p>The second implementation is <a href=""http://WWW.AtDot.Net/yarv/"">YARV</a> (short for ""Yet 
Another Ruby VM""). <a href=""http://RedMine.Ruby-Lang.Org/repositories/annotate/ruby-19/thread.c"">YARV implements Ruby Threads as POSIX or 
Windows NT Threads</a>, however, it uses a Global Interpreter 
Lock (GIL) to ensure that only one Ruby Thread can actually be 
scheduled at any one time.</p>

<p>Like MRI, C Threads <em>can</em> actually run parallel to Ruby Threads.</p>

<p>In the future, it is possible, that the GIL <em>might</em> get broken 
down into more fine-grained locks, thus allowing more and more 
code to actually run in parallel, but that's so far away, it is 
not even <em>planned</em> yet.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://JRuby.Org/"">JRuby</a> <a href=""http://SVN.JRuby.CodeHaus.Org/browse/jruby/trunk/jruby/src/org/jruby/RubyThread.java?r=HEAD"">implements Ruby Threads as Native Threads</a>, 
where ""Native Threads"" in case of the JVM obviously means ""JVM 
Threads"". JRuby imposes no additional locking on them. So, 
whether those threads can actually run in parallel depends on 
the JVM: some JVMs implement JVM Threads as OS Threads and some 
as Green Threads. (The mainstream JVMs from Sun/Oracle use exclusively OS threads since JDK 1.3)</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://XRuby.GoogleCode.Com/"">XRuby</a> also <a href=""http://Code.Google.Com/p/xruby/source/browse/trunk/src/com/xruby/runtime/builtin/RubyThread.java#21"">implements Ruby Threads as JVM Threads</a>. <strong>Update</strong>: XRuby is dead.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://IronRuby.Net/"">IronRuby</a> <a href=""http://IronRuby.RubyForge.Org/svn/trunk/src/IronRuby.Libraries/Builtins/ThreadOps.cs"">implements Ruby Threads as Native Threads</a>, 
where ""Native Threads"" in case of the CLR obviously means 
""CLR Threads"". IronRuby imposes no additional locking on them, 
so, they should run in parallel, as long as your CLR supports 
that.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://RubyDotNetCompiler.GoogleCode.Com/"">Ruby.NET</a> also <a href=""http://Code.Google.Com/p/rubydotnetcompiler/source/browse/trunk/src/RubyRuntime/Built-in%20Classes/Thread.cs#21"">implements Ruby Threads as CLR 
Threads</a>. <strong>Update:</strong> Ruby.NET is dead.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://Rubini.us/"">Rubinius</a> <a href=""https://GitHub.Com/EvanPhx/Rubinius/tree/master/kernel/core/thread.rb#L9"">implements Ruby Threads as Green Threads 
within its Virtual Machine</a>. More precisely: the Rubinius 
VM exports a very lightweight, very flexible 
concurrency/parallelism/non-local control-flow construct, called 
a ""<a href=""https://GitHub.Com/EvanPhx/Rubinius/tree/cpp/vm/builtin/task.cpp"">Task</a>"", and all other concurrency constructs (Threads in 
this discussion, but also <a href=""https://GitHub.Com/EvanPhx/Rubinius/tree/master/kernel/core/continuation.rb#L45"">Continuations</a>, <a href=""https://GitHub.Com/EvanPhx/Rubinius/tree/master/lib/actor.rb#L31"">Actors</a> and 
other stuff) are implemented in pure Ruby, using Tasks.</p>

<p>Rubinius can not (currently) schedule Threads in parallel, 
however, adding that isn't too much of a problem: Rubinius can 
already <a href=""https://GitHub.Com/EvanPhx/Rubinius/tree/master/kernel/core/vm.rb#L5"">run several VM instances in several POSIX Threads in 
parallel</a>, within one Rubinius process. Since Threads are 
actually implemented in Ruby, they can, like any other Ruby 
object, be serialized and sent to a different VM in a different 
POSIX Thread. (That's the same model the BEAM <a href=""http://Erlang.Org/"">Erlang</a> VM 
uses for SMP concurrency. It is already <a href=""https://GitHub.Com/EvanPhx/Rubinius/tree/master/lib/vmactor.rb"">implemented for 
Rubinius Actors</a>.)</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: The information about Rubinius in this answer is about the Shotgun VM, which doesn't exist anymore. The ""new"" C++ VM does not use green threads scheduled across multiple VMs (i.e. Erlang/BEAM style), it uses a more traditional single VM with multiple native OS threads model, just like the one employed by, say, the CLR, Mono, and pretty much every JVM.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://MacRuby.Org/"">MacRuby</a> started out as a port of YARV on top of the 
Objective-C Runtime and CoreFoundation and Cocoa Frameworks. It 
has now significantly diverged from YARV, but AFAIK it currently 
still <a href=""http://MacRuby.Org/trac/browser/MacRuby/trunk/thread.c?annotate=blame"">shares the same Threading Model with YARV</a>.
<strong>Update:</strong> MacRuby depends on apples garbage collector which is declared deprecated and will be removed in later versions of MacOSX, MacRuby is undead.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://Cardinal2.RubyForge.Org/"">Cardinal</a> is a Ruby Implementation for the <a href=""http://ParrotCode.Org/"">Parrot 
Virtual Machine</a>. It doesn't implement threads yet, however, 
when it does, it will probably implement them as <a href=""http://SVN.Perl.Org/viewvc/parrot/trunk/src/thread.c?view=annotate"">Parrot 
Threads</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://MagLev.GemStone.Com/"">MagLev</a> is a Ruby Implementation for the <a href=""http://GemStone.Com/products/smalltalk/"">GemStone/S 
Smalltalk VM</a>. I have no information what threading model 
GemStone/S uses, what threading model MagLev uses or even if 
threads are even implemented yet (probably not).</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://HotRuby.Yukoba.Jp/"">HotRuby</a> is <em>not</em> a full Ruby Implementation of its 
own. It is an implementation of a YARV bytecode VM in 
JavaScript. HotRuby doesn't support threads (yet?) and when it 
does, they won't be able to run in parallel, because JavaScript 
has no support for true parallelism. There is an ActionScript 
version of HotRuby, however, and ActionScript might actually 
support parallelism. <strong>Update</strong>: HotRuby is dead.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Unfortunately, only two of these 11 Ruby Implementations are 
actually production-ready: MRI and JRuby.</p>

<p>So, if you want true parallel threads, JRuby is currently your 
only choice – not that that's a bad one: JRuby is actually faster 
than MRI, and arguably more stable.</p>

<p>Otherwise, the ""classical"" Ruby solution is to use processes 
instead of threads for parallelism. The Ruby Core Library 
contains the <a href=""http://Ruby-Doc.Org/core/classes/Process.html""><code>Process</code> module</a> with the <a href=""http://Ruby-Doc.Org/core/classes/Process.html#M003179""><code>Process.fork</code> 
method</a> which makes it dead easy to fork off another Ruby 
process. Also, the Ruby Standard Library contains the 
<a href=""http://Ruby-Doc.Org/stdlib/libdoc/drb/rdoc/"">Distributed Ruby (dRuby / dRb)</a> library, which allows Ruby 
code to be trivially distributed across multiple processes, not 
only on the same machine but also across the network.</p>

"<p>What is your best practical user-friendly user-interface design or principle? </p>

<p>Please submit those practices that you find actually makes things really useful - no matter  what - if it works for your users, share it!</p>

<hr>

<p>Summary/Collation</p>

<p>Principles</p>

<ol>
<li>KISS.</li>
<li>Be clear and specific in what an option will achieve: for example, use verbs that indicate the action that will follow on a choice (see: Impl. 1).</li>
<li>Use obvious default actions appropriate to what the user needs/wants to achieve.</li>
<li>Fit the appearance and behavior of the UI to the environment/process/audience: stand-alone application, web-page, portable, scientific analysis, flash-game, professionals/children, ...</li>
<li>Reduce the learning curve of a new user.</li>
<li>Rather than disabling or hiding options, consider giving a helpful message where the user can have alternatives, but only where those alternatives exist. If no alternatives are available, its better to disable the option - which visually then states that the option is not available - do not hide the unavailable options, rather explain in a mouse-over popup why it is disabled.</li>
<li>Stay consistent and conform to practices, and placement of controls, as is implemented in widely-used successful applications.</li>
<li>Lead the expectations of the user and let your program behave according to those expectations.</li>
<li>Stick to the vocabulary and knowledge of the user and do not use programmer/implementation terminology.</li>
<li>Follow basic design principles: contrast (obviousness), repetition (consistency), alignment (appearance), and proximity (grouping).</li>
</ol>

<p>Implementation</p>

<ol>
<li>(See answer by paiNie) ""Try to use verbs in your dialog boxes.""</li>
<li>Allow/implement undo and redo.</li>

"<p>This is probably too much to ask, but is there any language that does a really terrific job of representing time and date operations?  I'll grant straight away that it's <b>really hard</b> to write a truly great time library.  That said, are there any widespread languages that have one?  Basically, I want something that handles time and date as comprehensively as modern regular expression libraries do their jobs. Everything I've seen so far in Python and Java omits one or more pretty important pieces, or makes too many things hard.</p>

<p>At least this should be intuitive to do:</p>

<ul>
<li>find the number of days between two given dates, number of minutes between two given minute periods, etc.  </li>
<li>add and subtract intervals from timestamps  </li>
<li>allow simple conversion between timezones, with Daylight Saving Time changes by region automatically accounted for (given that there's an accurate supporting database of regional settings available)  </li>
<li>get the period that a given timestamp falls into, given period granularity (""what calendar day is this date in?"")  </li>
<li>support very general string-to-date conversions (given a pattern)</li>
</ul>

<p>Further, if there's a Java-style Calendar/GregorianCalendar setup, the general Calendar class should be accommodating toward subclasses if I need to roll my own Hebrew, Babylonian, Tolkien, or MartianCalendar. (Java Calendars make this pointlessly hard, for example.)</p>

"<p>As popular as Ruby and Rails are, it seems like this problem would already be solved. JRuby and mod_rails are all fine and dandy, but why isn't there an Apache mod for just straight Ruby?</p>
","2988","jwmittag","<p>The basic problem is this: for a long time, MRI was the only feasible Ruby Implementation. MRI has a number of problems that make it hard to embed it into another application (which is basically what <a href=""http://ModRuby.Net/"">mod_ruby</a> does: it embeds MRI in Apache), especially a multi-threaded one (which Apache is). It is not particularly thread-safe and it has quite a bit of global state.</p>

<p>This global state means for example that if one Rails application modifies some class, then <em>all other</em> Rails applications that run on the same Apache server, will <em>also</em> see this modified class.</p>

<p>Another problem is that the MRI source code is not easily hackable. MRI is now more than 15 years old, and it's starting to show.</p>

<p>As a result of these problems, mod_ruby has never <em>really</em> properly worked, and at some point the maintainers simply gave up.</p>

<p>The C based PHP interpreter, on the other hand, was designed from day one to be run as mod_php inside Apache. Indeed, for the first couple of versions, there wasn't even a commandline version of the interpreter, mod_php was the <em>only</em> way to run PHP.</p>

<p><a href=""http://ModRails.Com/"">Phusion Passenger (aka mod_rack aka mod_rails)</a> solves this problem by basically giving up and sidestepping the problem: they simply run a seperate copy of MRI in a seperate process for every application. It works great, and not only for Ruby. It supports <a href=""http://WSGI.Org/"">WSGI</a> (standard interface for Python Web Frameworks), <a href=""http://Rack.RubyForge.Org/"">Rack</a> (standard interface for Ruby Web Frameworks) and direct support for Ruby on Rails.</p>

<p>My hopes are on <a href=""https://GitHub.Com/rue/mod_rubinius/"">mod_rubinius</a>, which unfortunately doesn't exist yet. <a href=""http://Rubini.us/"">Rubinius</a> was designed from the beginning to be thread-safe, embeddable, free of global state, not use the C stack and so on. It was designed to be able to run multiple Rubinius VMs inside one Rubinius process. This makes mod_rubinius infinitely easier to implement and maintain than mod_ruby. Unfortunately, of course, Rubinius is not released yet, and the real work on mod_rubinius cannot even begin until Rubinius is released. The good news is that mod_rubinius already has more manpower behind it than mod_ruby ever had, because it has paid developers working on it by a Rails hosting company that <em>desperately</em> wants to use it themselves.</p>

<p>It works something like this: you write a little piece of benchmark code (it <em>really</em> has to be little, because it will be re-compiled and executed several thousand times) that represents the performance characteristics of the larger program you want to optimize. Then Acovea randomly constructs some dozens of different GCC commandlines and compiles and runs your benchmark with each of them. The best of these commandlines are then allowed to ""mate"" and ""breed"" new ""children"" which (hopefully) inherit the best ""genes"" from their ""parents"". This process is repeated for a couple dozen ""generations"", until a stable set of commandline flags emerges.</p>

"<p>What makes a language strongly typed? I'm looking for the most important aspects of a strongly typed language.</p>

<p>Yesterday I asked if PowerShell was strongly typed, but no one could agree on the definition of ""strongly-typed"", so I'm looking to clarify the definition.</p>

<p>Feel free to link to wikipedia or other sources, but don't just cut and paste for your answer.</p>
","2988","jwmittag","<p>The term ""strongly typed"" has no agreed-upon definition.</p>

<p>It makes a ""great"" argument in a flamewar, because whenever someone is proven wrong, they can just redefine it to mean whatever they want it to mean. Other than that, the term serves no real purpose.</p>

<p>It is best to just not use the term, or, if you use it, rigorously define it first. If you see someone else use it, ask him to define the term.</p>

<p>Everybody has their own definition. Some that I have seen are:</p>

<ul>
<li>strongly typed = statically typed</li>
<li>strongly typed = explicitly typed</li>
<li>strongly typed = nominally typed</li>
<li>strongly typed = typed</li>
<li>strongly typed = has no implicit typecasts, only explicit</li>
<li>strongly typed = has no typecasts at all</li>
<li>strongly typed = what I understand / weakly typed = what I don't understand</li>
<li>strongly typed = C++ / weakly typed = everything else</li>

<li>strongly typed = .NET / weakly typed = everything else</li>
<li>strongly typed = <em>my</em> programming language / weakly typed = <em>your</em> programming language</li>

In particular, if there exists an expression <code>e1</code> such that it is accepted by a type system <code>T1</code>, but rejected by a type system <code>T2</code>, then <code>T2</code> is said to be <em>stronger</em> than <code>T1</code>. There are two important things to note here:</p>

<ol>
<li>this a comparative, not an absolute: there is no <em>strong</em> or <em>weak</em>, only <em>stronger</em> and <em>weaker</em></li>

"<p>For one and a half years, I have been keeping my eyes on the git community in hopes of making the switch away from SVN.  One particular issue holding me back is the inability to lock binary files. Throughout the past year I have yet to see developments on this issue.  I understand that locking files goes against the fundamental principles of distributed source control, but I don't see how a web development company can take advantage of git to track source code and image file changes when there is the potential for binary file conflicts.</p>

<p>To achieve the effects of locking, a ""central"" repository must be identified.  Regardless of the distributed nature of git, most companies will have a ""central"" repository for a software project.  We should be able to mark a file as requiring a lock from the governing git repository at a specified address.  Perhaps this is made difficult because git tracks file contents not files?</p>

<p>Do any of you have experience in dealing with git and binary files that should be locked before modification?</p>

<p>NOTE: It looks like Source Gear's new open source distributed version control project, Veracity, has locking as one of its goals.</p>
","2988","jwmittag","<p>When I was using Subversion, I religiously set the <code>svn:needs-lock</code> property on all binary and even the hard-to-edit text files. I <em>never</em> actually experienced any conflicts.</p>

<p>Now, in Git, I don't worry about such things. Remember: locks in Subversion aren't actually mandatory locks, they are merely communication tools. And guess what: I don't need Subversion to communicate, I can manage just fine with E-Mail, Phone and IM.</p>

<p>Another thing I did, is to replace many binary formats with plain text formats. I use reStructuredText or La&#932;<sub>&Epsilon;</sub>&Chi; instead of Word, CSV instead of Excel, ASCII-Art instead of Visio, YAML instead of databases, SVG instead of OO Draw, abc instead of MIDI, and so on.</p>

"<p>Right now, we are using Perforce for version control. It has the handy feature of a strictly increasing change number that we can use to refer to builds, eg ""you'll get the bugfix if your build is at least 44902"".</p>

<p>I'd like to switch over to using a distributed system (probably git) to make it easier to branch and to work from home. (Both of which are perfectly possible with Perforce, but the git workflow has some advantages.) So although ""tributary development"" would be distributed and not refer to a common revision sequencing, we'd still maintain a master git repo that all changes would need to feed into before a build was created.</p>

<p>What's the best way to preserve strictly increasing build ids? The most straightforward way I can think of is to have some sort of post-commit hook that fires off whenever the master repo gets updated, and it registers (the hash of) the new tree object (or commit object? I'm new to git) with a centralized database that hands out ids. (I say ""database"", but I'd probably do it with git tags, and just look for the next available tag number or something. So the ""database"" would really be .git/refs/tags/build-id/.)</p>

<p>This is workable, but I'm wondering if there is an easier, or already-implemented, or standard/""best practice"" way of accomplishing this.</p>
","2988","jwmittag","<p>I second the suggestion of using <code>git describe</code>. Provided that you have a sane versioning policy, and you don't do any crazy stuff with your repository, <code>git describe</code> will always be monotonic (at least as monotonic as you can be, when your revision history is a DAG instead of a tree) and unique.</p>

<p>A little demonstration:</p>

<pre><code>git init
git commit --allow-empty -m'Commit One.'
git tag -a -m'Tag One.' 1.2.3
git describe    # =&gt; 1.2.3
git commit --allow-empty -m'Commit Two.'
git describe    # =&gt; 1.2.3-1-gaac161d
git commit --allow-empty -m'Commit Three.'
git describe    # =&gt; 1.2.3-2-g462715d
git tag -a -m'Tag Two.' 2.0.0
git describe    # =&gt; 2.0.0
</code></pre>

<p>The output of <code>git describe</code> consists of the following components:</p>

<ol>
<li>The newest tag reachable from the commit you are asking to describe</li>
<li>The number of commits between the commit and the tag (if non-zero)</li>
<li>The (abbreviated) id of the commit (if #2 is non-zero)</li>
</ol>

<p>#2 is what makes the output monotonic, #3 is what makes it unique. #2 and #3 are omitted, when the commit <em>is</em> the tag, making <code>git describe</code> also suitable for production releases.</p>

<p>It took me all of 20 minutes.</p>

<p>I used a <em>fantastic</em> project called <a href=""https://GitHub.Com/TheWoolleyMan/CInABox/"" rel=""nofollow"">CInABox (Continuous Integration in a Box)</a>. It consists of two simple scripts which download and compile Ruby and download, install and configure <a href=""http://CruiseControlRb.ThoughtWorks.Com/"" rel=""nofollow"">CruiseControl.rb</a> for Ubuntu 8.04.</p>

<p>In just 20 minutes, I downloaded Ubuntu JeOS 8.04, configured a VirtualBox VM, installed Ubuntu in that VM, setup networking, installed Ruby, installed CruiseControl.rb, added my first project to CC.rb and watched the light go green! The most time was actually spent downloading Ubuntu, downloading Ruby and installing Ubuntu. The actual CI setup took less than 5 minutes.</p>

<p>Don't let the name fool you: CC.rb is <em>written in</em> Ruby, but you can build <em>anything</em> with it. In the default configuration, it assumes that you are using <code>rake</code> to build your project, but by setting just one configuration option, you can just as well use a shell script.</p>

"<p>In C#, I can do this:</p>

        animals.Add(new Dog());
        animals.Add(new Cat());

        foreach (Animal a in animals)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(a.MakeNoise());
            a.Sleep();
        }
    }
}

public class Animal
{
    public virtual string MakeNoise() { return String.Empty; }
    public void Sleep()

    }
}

public class Dog : Animal
{
    public override string MakeNoise()
    {
        return ""Woof!"";
    }
}

public class Cat : Animal
{
    public override string MakeNoise()
    {
        return ""Meow!"";
    }
}
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Woof</li>
<li>Dog is Sleeping</li>
<li>Meow</li>
<li>Cat is Sleeping</li>
</ul>

"
"<p>I keep hearing this term tossed around in several different contexts. What is it?</p>
","2988","jwmittag","<p>The other answers already do a fantastic job explaining what declarative programming is, so I'm just going to provide some examples of why that might be useful.</p>

<h1>Context Independence</h1>

<p>Declarative Programs are <em>context-independent</em>. Because they only declare what the ultimate goal is, but not the intermediary steps to reach that goal, the same program can be used in different contexts. This is hard to do with <em>imperative programs</em>, because they often depend on the context (e.g. hidden state).</p>

<p>Take <code>yacc</code> as an example. It's a parser generator aka. compiler compiler, an external declarative DSL for describing the grammar of a language, so that a parser for that language can automatically be generated from the description. Because of its context independence, you can do many different things with such a grammar: </p>

<ul>
<li>Generate a C parser for that grammar (the original use case for <code>yacc</code>)</li>
<li>Generate a C++ parser for that grammar</li>
<li>Generate a Java parser for that grammar (using Jay)</li>
<li>Generate a C# parser for that grammar (using GPPG)</li>
<li>Generate a Ruby parser for that grammar (using Racc)</li>
<li>Generate a tree visualization for that grammar (using GraphViz)</li>
<li>simply do some pretty-printing, fancy-formatting and syntax highlighting of the yacc source file itself and include it in your Reference Manual as a syntactic specification of your language</li>
</ul>

<p>And many more &hellip;</p>

<h1>Optimization</h1>

<p>Because you don't prescribe the computer which steps to take and in what order, it can rearrange your program much more freely, maybe even execute some tasks in parallel. A good example is a query planner and query optimizer for a SQL database. Most SQL databases allow you to display the query that they are <em>actually</em> executing vs. the query that you <em>asked</em> them to execute. Often, those queries look <em>nothing</em> like each other. The query planner takes things into account that you wouldn't even have dreamed of: rotational latency of the disk platter, for example or the fact that some completely different application for a completely different user just executed a similar query and the table that you are joining with and that you worked so hard to avoid loading is already in memory anyway.</p>

<p>There is an interesting trade-off here: the machine has to work harder to figure out <em>how</em> to do something than it would in an imperative language, but when it <em>does</em> figure it out, it has much more freedom and much more information for the optimization stage.</p>

"<p>I ruined several unit tests some time ago when I went through and refactored them to make them more <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself"">DRY</a>--the intent of each test was no longer clear.  It seems there is a trade-off between tests' readability and maintainability.  If I leave duplicated code in unit tests, they're more readable, but then if I change the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Under_Test"">SUT</a>, I'll have to track down and change each copy of the duplicated code.</p>

<p>Do you agree that this trade-off exists?  If so, do you prefer your tests to be readable, or maintainable?</p>
","2988","jwmittag","<p>Jay Fields coined the phrase that ""DSLs should be DAMP, not DRY"", where <em>DAMP</em> means <em>descriptive and meaningful phrases</em>. I think the same applies to tests, too. Obviously, too much duplication is bad. But removing duplication at all costs is even worse. Tests should act as intent-revealing specifications. If, for example, you specify the same feature from several different angles, then a certain amount of duplication is to be expected.</p>

"<p>When coding, what in your experience is a better approach? </p>

<ol>
<li>Break the problem down into small enough pieces and then implement each piece.</li>
<li>Break the problem down, but then implement using a top-down approach.</li>
<li>Any other?</li>
</ol>
","2988","jwmittag","<p>Both are valid approaches. Sometimes one just ""feels"" more natural than the other. However, there is one big problem: some mainstream languages and especially their frameworks and libraries really <em>heavily</em> on IDE support, such as syntax highlighting, background type checking, background compilation, intelligent code completion, IntelliSense and so on.</p>

<p>However, <em>this doesn't work with top-down coding!</em> In top-down coding, you constantly use variables, fields, constants, functions, procedures, methods, classes, modules, traits, mixins, aspects, packages and types <em>that you haven't implemented yet!</em> So, the IDE will constantly yell at you because of compile errors, there will be red squiggly lines everywhere, you will get no code completion and so on. So, the IDE pretty much <em>prohibits</em> you from doing top-down coding.</p>

<p>Are there any good tutorials on this subject?</p>

<p>Is it better to test it using an emulator or physical pc?</p>
","2988","jwmittag","<p>It doesn't really matter, what language you choose. If the language is Turing-complete, then you can write an OS in it.</p>

<p>However, the expressiveness of the language will make certain kinds of designs very easy or very hard to implement. For example, the ""liveliness"" and dynamism of the old Smalltalk OSs depends on the fact that they are implemented in Smalltalk. You <em>could</em> do that in C, too, but it would probably be so hard that you wouldn't even think about it. JavaScript or Ruby OTOH would probably be a great fit.</p>

<p><a href=""http://Research.Microsoft.Com/OS/Singularity/"" rel=""nofollow"">Microsoft Research's Singularity</a> is another example. It simply couldn't be implemented in anything other than Sing#, <a href=""http://Research.Microsoft.Com/SpecSharp/"" rel=""nofollow"">Spec#</a> and <a href=""http://MSDN.Microsoft.Com/vcsharp/"" rel=""nofollow"">C#</a> (or similar languages), because so much of the architecture is dependent on the static type safety and static verifiability of those languages.</p>

<p>One thing to keep in mind: the design space for OSs implemented in C is pretty much fully explored. There's literally thousands of them. In other languages, however, you might actually discover something that nobody has discovered before! There's only about a dozen or so OSs written in Java, about half a dozen in C#, something on the order of two OSs in Haskell, only <em>one</em> in Python and <em>none</em> in Ruby or JavaScript.</p>

"<p>I have used ""traditional"" version control systems to maintain source code repositories on past projects.

","2988","jwmittag","<p>In my own experience moving from Subversion to Git, the most important thing is not what you need to learn, but what you need to <em>unlearn</em>. Distributed Version Control is <em>very</em> different from Centralized Version Control. CVC is a subset of DVC, so you can just do CVC in a DVC tool, but it will be more complicated than with a CVC tool.</p>

<p>Try to unlearn CVC, and get in the DVC mindset. If you just end up doing CVC in a DVC tool, you will merely be frustrated by all the added complexity and you will not realize what that added complexity is buying you in terms of flexibility.</p>

<p>All DVC tools have <em>great</em> and very powerful support for branching and merging. Use it. All the history is available at your fingertips. Use it. (For example: never comment out code, just delete it. You can always get it back, even on an airplane with no internet connection.)</p>

<p>One very important aspect of Git: all other tools have a more or less defined workflow. Git doesn't. Git is a DVCS workflow construction kit. This makes it sometimes hard to know what to do: you have to design and implement your own workflow (hint: use lots of shell scripts).

"<p>I understand that IronPython is an implementation of Python on the .NET platform just like IronRuby is an implementation of Ruby and F# is more or less OCaml.  </p>

<p>What I can't seem to grasp is whether these languages perform closer to their ""ancestors"" or closer to something like C# in terms of speed.  For example, is IronPython somehow ""compiled"" down to the same bytecode used by C# and, therefore, will run just as fast?</p>
","2988","jwmittag","<p>IronPython is actually the fastest Python implementation out there. For some definition of ""fastest"", at least: the startup overhead of the CLR, for example, is <em>huge</em> compared to CPython. Also, the optimizing compiler IronPython has, really only makes sense, when code is executed multiple times.</p>

<p>IronRuby has the potential to be as fast IronPython, since many of the interesting features that make IronPython fast, have been extracted into the Dynamic Language Runtime, on which both IronPython and IronRuby (and Managed JavaScript, Dynamic VB, IronScheme, VistaSmalltalk and others) are built.</p>

<p>In general, the speed of a language implementation is pretty much independent of the actual language features, and more dependent on the number of engineering man-years that go into it. IOW: dynamic vs. static doesn't matter, money does.</p>

<p>E.g., Common Lisp is a language that is even more dynamic than Ruby or Python, and yet there are Common Lisp compilers out there that can even give C a run for its money. Good Smalltalk implementations run as fast as Java (which is no surprise, since both major JVMs, Sun HotSpot and IBM J9, are actually just slightly modified Smalltalk VMs) or C++.

"<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_functional_programming"">Wikipedia</a> has this to say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Total functional programming (also
  known as strong functional
  programming, to be contrasted with
  ordinary, or weak functional
  programming) is a programming paradigm
  which restricts the range of programs
  to those which are provably
  terminating.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These restrictions mean that total
  functional programming is not
  Turing-complete. However, the set of
  algorithms which can be used is still
  huge. For example, any algorithm which
  has had an asymptotic upper bound
  calculated for it can be trivially
  transformed into a
  provably-terminating function by using
  the upper bound as an extra argument
  which is decremented upon each
  iteration or recursion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is also a Lambda The Ultimate Post about a paper on <a href=""http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/2003"">Total Functional Programming</a>.</p>

<p>I hadn't come across that until last week on a mailing list.</p>

<p>Are there any more resources, references or any example implementations that you know of?</p>
","2988","jwmittag","<p>If I understood that correctly, Total Functional Programming means just that: Programming with Total Functions. If I remember my math courses correctly, a Total Function is a function which is defined over its entire domain, a Partial Function is one which has ""holes"" in its definition.</p>

<p>Now, if you have a function which for some input value <code>v</code> goes into an infinite recursion or an infinite loop or in general doesn't terminate in some other fashion, then your function isn't defined for <code>v</code>, and thus partial, i.e. not total.</p>

<p>Total Functional Programming doesn't allow you to write such a function. All functions always return a result for all possible inputs; and the type checker ensures that this is the case.</p>

<p>My guess is that this vastly simplifies error handling: there aren't any.</p>

<p>The downside is already mentioned in your quote: it's not Turing-complete. E.g. an Operating System is essentially a giant infinite loop. Indeed, we do not <em>want</em> an Operating System to terminate, we call this behaviour a ""crash"" and yell at our computers about it!</p>

There are even POSIX Thread implementations that use green threads, e.g. the old LinuxThreads library or the GNU pth library.</p>

<p>And just because an implementation uses native threads doesn't mean that these threads can actually run in parallel; many implementations use a Global Interpreter Lock to ensure only one thread can run at a time. On the other hand, using green threads doesn't mean that they can't run in parallel: the BEAM Erlang VM for example can schedule its green threads (more precisely green processes) across mulitple CPU cores, the same is planned for the Rubinius Ruby VM.</p>

<p>Once I've completed the program, I would still have access to the original source, so maintaining the application would not be the problem. If the application is distributed, I would not want any of the users to be able to decompile it. Obfuscation does not achieve this as the users would still be able to decompile it, and while they would have difficulty following the action flows, they would be able to see the code, and potentially take information out of it.</p>

<p>What I'm concerned about is if there is any information in the code relating to remote access. There is a host to which the application connects using a user-id and password provided by the user. Is there a way to hide the host's address from the user, if that address is located inside the source code?</p>

","2988","J&#246;rg W Mittag","<p>At the moment, there are no C1 coverage tools for Ruby. In fact, there aren't <em>any</em> coverage tools other than RCov.</p>

<p>Until recently, it was only possible to write tools like this by patching or extending the MRI interpreter in C. Since approximately two years ago, it is also possible to extend JRuby in Java, and there is actually since last month a port of RCov for JRuby. However, this requires both a knowledge of Ruby <em>and</em> C, and a pretty deep knowledge at that, because fiddling around with the internals of MRI is not for the faint at heart.</p>

<p>But only with Rubinius will it be possible to write dynamic analysis tools such as code coverage tools in Ruby itself, making tool writing accessible to a much larger portion of the Ruby community. My hope is that this, coupled with the substantial financial backing of tool vendors (many major IDE vendors are either working on or have already introduced Ruby IDEs, including CodeGear (ex-Borland), IntelliJ, NetBeans, Eclipse, SapphireSteel (Ruby in Steel for Visual Studio) and even Microsoft) will lead to rapid innovation in the Ruby tooling space in 2009 and we will see things like C1, C2 coverage, NPath complexity, much more fine-grained profiling and so on.</p>

<p>Until then, the only idea I have is to use Java tools. The JRuby guys try to emit the proper magic metadata to make their generated bytecode at least penetrable by the Java tools.

"<p>I am attempting to determine prior art for the following idea:</p>

<p>(<strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This obviously does not produce ""elegant"" code that is well-tailored to the destination language. It simply does a rudimentary translation that is runnable.

So, Volta transforms the CIL to CPS and then implements CPS with exceptions. (Newer versions of JavaScript have semi-coroutines in the form of generators; those could also be used, but Volta is intended to work across a wide range of JavaScript versions, including obviously JScript in Internet Explorer.)</p>

<p>Or am I way off base here and there's only one way to define classes?</p>

<p>I would like to avoid using third-party libraries - at least at first.<br>
Looking for other answers, I found the article <em><a href=""http://www.webreference.com/js/column79/"">Object-Oriented Programming with JavaScript, Part I: Inheritance - Doc JavaScript</a></em> that discusses object-oriented programming in JavaScript. Is there a better way to do inheritance? </p>
","2988","J&#246;rg W Mittag","<p>The best way to define a class in JavaScript is to not define a class.</p>

<p>Seriously.</p>

<p>There are several different flavors of object-orientation, some of them are: </p>

<ul>
<li>class-based OO (first introduced by Smalltalk)</li>
<li>prototype-based OO (first introduced by Self)</li>
<li>multimethod-based OO (first introduced by CommonLoops, I think)</li>
<li>predicate-based OO (no idea)</li>
</ul>

<p>And probably others I don't know about.</p>

<p>JavaScript implements prototype-based OO. In prototype-based OO, new objects are created by copying other objects (instead of being instantiated from a class template) and methods live directly in objects instead of in classes. Inheritance is done via delegation: if an object doesn't have a method or property, it is looked up on its prototype(s) (i.e. the object it was cloned from), then the prototype's prototypes and so on.</p>

<p>In other words: there are no classes.</p>

<p>JavaScript actually has a nice tweak of that model: constructors. Not only can you create objects by copying existing ones, you can also construct them ""out of thin air"", so to speak. If you call a function with the <code>new</code> keyword, that function becomes a constructor and the <code>this</code> keyword will not point to the current object but instead to a newly created ""empty"" one. So, you can configure an object any way you like. In that way, JavaScript constructors can take on one of the roles of classes in traditional class-based OO: serving as a template or blueprint for new objects.</p>

<p>Now, JavaScript is a very powerful language, so it is quite easy to implement a class-based OO system <em>within JavaScript</em> if you want to. However, you should only do this if you really have a need for it and not just because that's the way Java does it.</p>

"<p>What are the real differences between anonymous type(var) in c# 3.0 and dynamic type(dynamic) that is coming in c# 4.0?</p>
","2988","J&#246;rg W Mittag","<p>You seem to be mixing three completely different, orthogonal things:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>static vs. dynamic</em> typing</li>
<li><em>manifest vs. implicit</em> typing</li>
<li><em>named vs. anonymous</em> types</li>
</ul>

<p>Those three aspects are completely independent, they have nothing whatsoever to do with each other.</p>

<p><em>Static vs. dynamic</em> typing refers to <em>when</em> the type checking takes place: dynamic typing takes place at <em>runtime</em>, static typing takes place <em>before runtime</em>.</p>

<p><em>Manifest vs. implicit</em> typing refers to whether the types are <em>manifest in the source code</em> or not: manifest typing means that the <em>programmer</em> has to write the types into the source code, implicit typing means that the <em>type system</em> figures them out on its own.</p>

<p><em>Named vs. anonymous</em> types refers to, well, whether the types have names or not.</p>

<p>The <code>dynamic</code> keyword in C# 4.0 means that this variable, parameter, method, field, property ... whatever is <em>dynamically typed</em>, i.e. that its type will be checked at runtime. Everything that is not typed as dynamic is statically typed. Whether a type is static or dynamic not only determines when type checking takes place, but in C# 4.0 it also determines, when <em>method dispatch</em> takes place. In C#, method dispatch is done before runtime, based on the static type (with the exception of runtime subtype polymorphism of course), whereas on dynamically typed objects in C# 4.0, method dispatch is done at runtime, based on the runtime type.</p>

<p>The <code>var</code> keyword in C# 3.0 means that this local variable will be <em>implicitly typed</em>, i.e. that instead of the programmer writing down the type explicitly, the type system will figure it out on its own. This has nothing to do with dynamic typing, at least in C# 3.0. The variable will be strongly statically typed just as if you had written down the type yourself. It is merely a convenience: for example, why would you have to write down all the type names <em>twice</em> in <code>HashMap&lt;int, string&gt; foo = new HashMap&lt;int, string&gt;();</code> when the type system can <em>clearly</em> figure out that <code>foo</code> is a <code>HashMap&lt;int, string&gt;</code>, so instead you write <code>var foo = new HashMap&lt;int, string();</code>. Please note that there is nothing dynamic or anonymous about this. The type is static and it has a name: <code>HashMap&lt;int, string&gt;</code>. Of course, in C# 4.0, if the type system figures out that the right hand side of the assignment is dynamic, then the type of the variable on the left hand side will be dynamic.</p>

<p>An <em>anonymous type</em> in C# 3.0 means that this type has no name. Well, actually, <em>real</em> anonymous types would have required a backwards-incompatible change to the Common Type System, so what <em>actually</em> happens behind the curtain is that the compiler will generate a very long, very random, unique and illegal name for the type and put that name in wherever the anonymous type appears. But from the programmer's point of view, the type has no name. Why is this useful? Well, sometimes you have intermediate results that you only need briefly and then throw away again. Giving such transient types a name of their own would elevate them to a level of importance that they simply don't deserve. But again, there is nothing dynamic about this.</p>

<p>So, if the type has no name, how can the programmer refer to it? Well, she can't! At least not directly. What the programmer <em>can</em> do, is describe the type: it has two properties, one called ""name"" of type <code>string</code>, the other called ""id"" of type <code>int</code>. That's the type I want, but I don't care what it's called.</p>

<p>Here is where the pieces start to come together. In C#, you have to declare the types of local variables by explicitly writing down the names of the types. But, how can you write down the name of a type that has no name? This is where <code>var</code> comes in: because since C# 3.0, this is actually no longer true: you no longer have to write down the names, you can also tell the compiler to figure it out. So, while what I wrote in the first paragraph above is true, that implicit typing and anonymous types don't have anything to do with other, it is also true that anonymous types would be pretty useless without implicit typing.</p>

<p>Note, however, that the opposite is not true: implicit typing is perfectly useful without anonymous types. <code>var foo = HashMap&lt;int, string&gt;</code> makes perfect sense and there's no anonymous type in sight.</p>

<p>In general, the Church-Turing-Thesis tells us that everything that can be done in <em>one</em> language can also be done in <em>every other</em> language.</p>

<p>As you can probably tell from the selection of examples above, I am (mostly) a Ruby programmer. So, just as a joke, I took one of the examples above and re-implemented it in a language that I know <em>absolutely nothing</em> about, that is usually thought of as a not very powerful language, and that seems to be the only programming language on the planet for which I was not able to find a Monad tutorial. May I present to you &hellip; the Identity Monad in PHP:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
class Identity {
  protected $val;
  public function __construct($val) { $this-&gt;val = $val; }
  public static function m_return($a) { return new Identity($a); }
  public static function m_bind($id_a, $f) { return $f($id_a-&gt;val); }
}

var_dump(Identity::m_bind(
  Identity::m_return(1), function ($x) {
    return Identity::m_return($x+1);
  }
));
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>No static types, no generics, no closures necessary.</p>

<p>Now, if you actually want to statically check monads, then you need a static type system. But that is more or less a tautology: if you want to statically check types, you need a static type checker. Duh.</p>

<p>With regards to your question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In my understanding, the language implementing monad should be type-checked statically. Otherwise, type errors cannot be found during compilation and ""Complexity"" is not controlled. Is my understanding correct?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are right, but this has nothing to do with monads. This is just about static type checking in general, and applies equally well to arrays, lists or even plain boring integers.</p>

<p>There is also a red herring here: if you look for example at monad implementations in C#, Java or C, they are much longer and much more complex than, say, the PHP example above. In particular, there's <em>tons</em> of types everywhere, so it certainly <em>looks</em> impressive. But the ugly truth is: C#'s, Java's and C's type systems aren't actually powerful enough to express the type of <code>Monad</code>. In particular, <code>Monad</code> is a rank-2 polymorphic type, but C# and Java only support rank-1 polymorphism (they call it ""generics"", but it's the same thing) and C doesn't support even that.</p>

<p>So, monads are in fact <em>not</em> statically type-checked in C#, Java and C. (That's for example the reason why the LINQ monad comprehensions are defined as a pattern and not as a type: because you simply cannot <em>express</em> the type in C#.) All the static type system does, is make the implementation much more complex, without actually helping. It requires a much more sophisticated type system such as Haskell's, to get actual type-safety for monads.</p>

<p>Note: what I wrote above <em>only</em> applies to the generic <code>monad</code> type itself, as @Porges points out. You can certainly express the type of any <em>specific</em> monad, like <code>List</code> or <code>Maybe</code>, but you cannot express the type of <code>Monad</code> itself. And this means that you cannot type-check the fact that ""<code>List</code> IS-A <code>Monad</code>"", and you cannot type-check generic operations that work on all instances of <code>Monad</code>.</p>

<p>(Note that checking that <code>Monad</code> also obeys the monad <em>laws</em> in addition to conforming to the monad <em>type</em> is probably too much even for Haskell's type system. You'd probably need dependent types and maybe even a full-blown automatic theorem prover for that.)</p>
"
"<p>I'm working on improving our group's development process, and I'm considering how best to implement Design By Contract with Test-Driven Development.  It seems the two techniques have a lot of overlap, and I was wondering if anyone had some insight on the following (related) questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Isn't it against the DRY principle to have TDD and DbC unless you're using some kind of code generator to generate the unit tests based on contracts?  Otherwise, you have to maintain the contract in two places (the test and the contract itself), or am I missing something?</li>
<li>To what extent does TDD make DbC redundant?  If I write tests well enough, aren't they equivalent to writing a contract?  Do I only get added benefit if I enforce the contract at run time as well as through the tests?</li>
<li>Is it significantly easier/more flexible to only use TDD rather than TDD with DbC?  </li>
</ul>

<p>The main point of these questions is this more general question: <strong>If we're already doing TDD properly, will we get a significant benefit for the overhead if we also use DbC?</strong></p>

<p>A couple of details, though I think the question is largely language-agnostic:</p>

<ul>
<li>Our team is very small, &lt;10 programmers.</li>
<li>We mostly use Perl.</li>
</ul>
","2988","J&#246;rg W Mittag","<p>I think there is overlap between DbC and TDD, however, I don't think there is duplicated work: introducing DbC will probably result in a reduction of test cases.</p>

<p>Let me explain.</p>

<p>In TDD, tests aren't really tests. They are behavioral specifications. However, they are <em>also</em> design tools: by writing the test first, you use the external API of your object under test – that you haven't actually written yet – in the same way that a user would. That way, you design the API in a way that makes sense to a user, and not in the way that makes it easiest for you to implement. Something like <code>queue.full?</code> instead of <code>queue.num_entries == queue.size</code>.</p>

<p>This second part cannot be replaced by Contracts.</p>

<p>The first part <em>can</em> be partially replaced by contracts, at least for unit tests. TDD tests serve as specifications of behavior, both to other developers (unit tests) and domain experts (acceptance tests). Contracts <em>also</em> specify behavior, to other developers, to domain experts, but also to the compiler and the runtime library.</p>

<p>But contracts have fixed granularity: you have method pre- and postconditions, object invariants, module contracts and so on. Maybe loop variants and invariants. Unit tests however, test units of behavior. Those might be smaller than a method or consist of multiple methods. That's not something you can do with contracts. And for the ""big picture"" you still need integration tests, functional tests and acceptance tests.</p>

<p>And there is another important part of TDD that DbC doesn't cover: the middle D. In TDD, tests <em>drive</em> your development process: you never write a single line of implementation code unless you have a failing test, you never write a single line of test code unless your tests all pass, you only write the minimal amount of implementation code to make the tests pass, you only write the minimal amount of test code to produce a failing test.</p>

<p>In conclusion: use tests to design the ""flow"", the ""feel"" of the API. Use contracts to design the, well, contract of the API. Use tests to provide the ""rhythm"" for the development process.</p>

<p>Something like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Write an acceptance test for a feature</li>
<li>Write a unit test for a unit that implements a part of that feature</li>
<li>Using the method signature you designed in step 2, write the method prototype</li>
<li>Add the postcondition</li>
<li>Add the precondition</li>
<li>Implement the method body</li>
<li>If the acceptance test passes, goto 1, otherwise goto 2</li>
</ol>

<p>If you want to know what Bertrand Meyer, the inventor of Design by Contract, thinks about combining TDD and DbC, there is a nice paper by his group, called <a href=""http://SE.ETHZ.Ch/people/leitner/publications/cdd_leitner_esec_fse_2007.pdf"">Contract-Driven Design = Test-Driven Development - Writing Test Cases</a>. The basic premise is that contracts provide an abstract representation of all possible cases, whereas test cases only test specific cases. Therefore, a suitable test harness can be automatically generated from the contracts.</p>

"<p>This question is about the rare case of software that is neither in active development nor moribund.</p>

<p>First, why is it so rare for software to ever be finished?  It seems ""no longer in active development"" is often synonymous with ""moribund"".  Second, what are exceptions to this?  Donald Knuth's TeX is a famous example.  It's been untouched for years yet remains massively popular.  Knuth even has a cash bug bounty, which is never claimed anymore.  There are probably various unix utilities like this, used ubiquitously yet with the source code in stasis.  I'd like to collect some interesting examples and commentary on why this is rare.</p>

<p>Actually, it's exactly the opposite: moving from <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> makes your HTML <em>less</em> semantic.

<p>It always ticks me off, when I see a forest of <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s described as ""semantic HTML"". No, it's not! That's <em>un-</em>semantic HTML! Especially if it contains a lot of <code>&lt;div class='float-left'&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;div id='bottom'&gt;</code> and my personal favorites <code>&lt;div class='paragraph'&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;span class='emphasis'&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>Don't get me wrong, using un-semantic <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s is certainly better than using <em>wrong</em>-semantic <code>&lt;table&gt;</code>s, but even better would be to use the semantically <em>correct</em> elements – although in many cases the problem is that HTML doesn't offer any. In your snippet for example, you use the <code>&lt;address&gt;</code> element, but according to <a href=""http://W3.Org/TR/html5/the-root.html#the-address"" rel=""nofollow"">the specification</a>, this element is <em>not</em> meant for marking up addresses! It is <em>only</em> for marking up the address <em>of the author of the page</em> – IOW it's utterly useless.</p>

<p>The example that you posted is missing a lot of context, so it is hard to say, but it actually looks like you might want to display either tabular or hierarchical data, in which case <code>&lt;table&gt;</code>s or <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>s might be a better choice.</p>

","2988","J&#246;rg W Mittag","<p>As far as I know, the most powerful static DbC language so far is <a href=""http://Research.Microsoft.Com/SpecSharp/"">Spec# by Microsoft Research</a>.

<p>If the Theorem Prover can prove that a contract will <em>always</em> be violated, that's a compile error. If the Theorem Prover can prove that a contract will <em>never</em> be violated, that's an optimization: the contract checks are removed from the final DLL.</p>

<p>As Charlie Martin points out, proving contracts in general is equivalent to solving the Halting Problem and thus not possible.

"<p>A friend asked me last week how to enumerate or list all variables within a program/function/etc. for the purposes of debugging (essentially getting a snapshot of everything so you can see what variables are set to, or if they are set at all). I looked around a bit and found a relatively good way for Python:</p>

<pre>
#!/usr/bin/python                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
foo1 = ""Hello world""
foo2 = ""bar""
foo3 = {""1"":""a"",
        ""2"":""b""}
foo4 = ""1+1""

for name in dir():
    myvalue = eval(name)
    print name, ""is"", type(name), ""and is equal to "", myvalue
</pre>

<p>which will output something like:</p>

<pre>
__builtins__ is &lt;type 'str'&gt; and is equal to  &lt;module '__builtin__' (built-in)&gt;
__doc__ is &lt;type 'str'&gt; and is equal to  None
__file__ is &lt;type 'str'&gt; and is equal to  ./foo.py
__name__ is &lt;type 'str'&gt; and is equal to  __main__
foo1 is &lt;type 'str'&gt; and is equal to  Hello world
foo2 is &lt;type 'str'&gt; and is equal to  bar
foo3 is &lt;type 'str'&gt; and is equal to  {'1': 'a', '2': 'b'}
foo4 is &lt;type 'str'&gt; and is equal to  1+1
</pre>

<p>I have so far found a partial way in PHP (courtesy of <a href=""http://www.phpro.org/examples/List-all-variables.html"">link text</a>) but it only lists all variables and their types, not the contents:</p>

<pre>
&lt;?php
// create a few variables
$bar = 'foo';
$foo ='bar';
// create a new array object
$arrayObj = new ArrayObject(get_defined_vars());
// loop over the array object and echo variables and values
for($iterator = $arrayObj-&gt;getIterator(); $iterator-&gt;valid(); $iterator-&gt;next())
        {
        echo $iterator-&gt;key() . ' =&gt; ' . $iterator-&gt;current() . '&lt;br /&gt;';
        }
?&gt;
</pre>

"<p>I've been doing a project at work recently focused on an almost entirely client-driven web  site. Obviously Javascript is used heavily, and I've been using jQuery on top of it which has turned out to be an absolute pleasure to work with.</p>

<p>One of the things that has surprised me in this is how much I like the JSON object syntax and it's use within javascript (highlighted by jQuery, which uses it everywhere). for those that aren't familiar with it, consider this brief example:</p>

<pre><code>function add(params) {
    params.result(params.a, params.b);
}

add({
    a: 1,
    b: 2,
    result: function(value) {
        alert(value);
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, this example is extremely contrived but it illustrates the basic usage. The JSON describes an object on the fly, passed in this case as a parameter to the function, and even defines a function within it for use as a callback. I personally find this methodology very easy to use, understand, and produce APIs with (though I know there are those that would disagree with me.)</p>

<p>So my question is, is this type of syntax unique to javascript? I know that many languages have JSON parsers (and have used several) but they don't allow for this sort of inlined declaration. And granted, much of what you can do with this syntax can be duplicated via named parameters in various languages and lambda expressions or function pointers (Python jumps to mind), but I still don't find that quite as elegant.</p>

The basic mechanics of this refactoring is that instead of checking for <code>nil</code> in the <em>client</em> code you instead make sure that the <em>provider</em> never produces a <code>nil</code> in the first place, by introducing a context-specific <em>null object</em> and returning that.</p>

<p>So, return an empty string, an empty array, an empty hash or a special empty customer or empty user or something instead of just <code>nil</code> and then you will never need to check for <code>nil</code> in the first place.</p>

<pre><code>class NullUser &lt; User
    def name

<p>However, in Ruby there is actually another, quite elegant, way of implementing the Introduce Null Object Refactoring: you don't actually need to <em>introduce</em> a Null Object, because <code>nil</code> is <em>already</em> an object! So, you could monkey-patch <code>nil</code> to behave as a NullUser – however, all the usual warnings and pitfalls regarding monkey-patching apply even more strongly in this case, since making <code>nil</code> silently swallow <code>NoMethodError</code>s or something like that can totally mess up your debugging experience and make it <em>really</em> hard to track down cases where there is a <code>nil</code> that shouldn't be there (as opposed to a <code>nil</code> that serves as a Null Object).</p>

"<h3>Original Question</h3>

<p>What I'd like is not a standard C pre-processor, but a variation on it which would accept from somewhere - probably the command line via -DNAME1 and -UNAME2 options - a specification of which macros are defined, and would then eliminate dead code.</p>

<p>It may be easier to understand what I'm after with some examples:</p>

<pre><code>#ifdef NAME1
#define ALBUQUERQUE ""ambidextrous""
#else
#define PHANTASMAGORIA ""ghostly""
#endif
</code></pre>

<p>If the command were run with '-DNAME1', the output would be:</p>

<pre><code>#define ALBUQUERQUE ""ambidextrous""
</code></pre>

<p>If the command were run with '-UNAME1', the output would be:</p>

<pre><code>#define PHANTASMAGORIA ""ghostly""
</code></pre>

<p>If the command were run with neither option, the output would be the same as the input.</p>

<p>This is a simple case - I'd be hoping that the code could handle more complex cases too.</p>

<p>To illustrate with a real-world but still simple example:</p>

<pre><code>#ifdef USE_VOID
#ifdef PLATFORM1
#define VOID void
#else
#undef VOID
typedef void    VOID;
#endif /* PLATFORM1 */
typedef void *  VOIDPTR;
#else
typedef mint     VOID;
typedef char *  VOIDPTR;
#endif /* USE_VOID */
</code></pre>

<p>I'd like to run the command with <code>-DUSE_VOID -UPLATFORM1</code> and get the output:</p>

<pre><code>#undef VOID
typedef void    VOID;
typedef void *  VOIDPTR;
</code></pre>

<p>Another example:</p>

<pre><code>#ifndef DOUBLEPAD
#if (defined NT) || (defined OLDUNIX)
#define DOUBLEPAD 8
#else
#define DOUBLEPAD 0
#endif /* NT */
#endif /* !DOUBLEPAD */
</code></pre>

<p>Ideally, I'd like to run with <code>-UOLDUNIX</code> and get the output:</p>

<pre><code>#ifndef DOUBLEPAD
#if (defined NT)
#define DOUBLEPAD 8
#else
#define DOUBLEPAD 0
#endif /* NT */
#endif /* !DOUBLEPAD */
</code></pre>

<p>This may be pushing my luck!</p>

<p>Motivation: large, ancient code base with lots of conditional code.  Many of the conditions no longer apply - the OLDUNIX platform, for example, is no longer made and no longer supported, so there is no need to have references to it in the code.  Other conditions are always true.  For example, features are added with conditional compilation so that a single version of the code can be used for both older versions of the software where the feature is not available and newer versions where it is available (more or less).  Eventually, the old versions without the feature are no longer supported - everything uses the feature - so the condition on whether the feature is present or not should be removed, and the 'when feature is absent' code should be removed too.  I'd like to have a tool to do the job automatically because it will be faster and more reliable than doing it manually (which is rather critical when the code base includes 21,500 source files).</p>

<p>(A really clever version of the tool might read <code>#include</code>'d files to determine whether the control macros - those specified by -D or -U on the command line - are defined in those files.  I'm not sure whether that's truly helpful except as a backup diagnostic.  Whatever else it does, though, the pseudo-pre-processor must not expand macros or include files verbatim.  The output must be source similar to, but usually simpler than, the input code.)</p>

<h3>Status Report (one year later)</h3>

<p>After a year of use, I am very happy with '<a href=""http://sunifdef.strudl.org/"">sunifdef</a>' recommended by the selected answer.  It hasn't made a mistake yet, and I don't expect it to.  The only quibble I have with it is stylistic.  Given an input such as:</p>

<pre><code>#if (defined(A) &amp;&amp; defined(B)) || defined(C) || (defined(D) &amp;&amp; defined(E))
</code></pre>

<p>and run with '-UC' (C is never defined), the output is:</p>

<pre><code>#if defined(A) &amp;&amp; defined(B) || defined(D) &amp;&amp; defined(E)
</code></pre>

<p>This is technically correct because '&amp;&amp;' binds tighter than '||', but it is an open invitation to confusion.  I would much prefer it to include parentheses around the sets of '&amp;&amp;' conditions, as in the original:</p>

<pre><code>#if (defined(A) &amp;&amp; defined(B)) || (defined(D) &amp;&amp; defined(E))
</code></pre>

<p>However, given the obscurity of some of the code I have to work with, for that to be the biggest nit-pick is a strong compliment; it is valuable tool to me.</p>

"<p>How does version control differ from plain backups?</p>

<p>Let's forget about the feature decoration, and concentrate on the soul of version control. Is there a clear line that backups must cross before they can be called a VCS? Or are they, at heart, the same thing with different target markets?</p>

<p>If there is a fundamental difference, what is the absolute minimum requirement for something to reach the status of version control?</p>

<p><em>When you answer, please don't just list features (such as delta compression, distributed/central repositories, and concurrent access solutions) that most version control systems have or should have, unless they actually are necessary for a VCS by definition.</em></p>
","2988","J&#246;rg W Mittag","<p>I see several fundamental differences between backups and version control:</p>

<ol>
<li>Backups only store the latest version, or, even if they store multiple versions, they don't store <em>every</em> version. A VCS <em>does</em> store every version,</li>
<li>That backup version is often out of date, because backups don't record every change, while VCSs do,</li>
<li>VCSs allow to pursue multiple alternative versions of the same change at the same time (i.e. branching).</li>
</ol>

<p>However, the single most important difference between backups and VCS is that, in a VCS, changes have <em>meaning</em>. In a backup, a new version is made, because some <em>computer</em> somewhere decided that it was <code>x</code> hours since the last backup; the change itself is completely <em>meaningless</em>. In a VCS, a new version is made, because some <em>human</em> decided that this version has its own <em>meaning</em>, its own identity, different from all the other versions. So, in a backup, all versions are equal (more precisely: they are equally meaningless), whereas in a VCS all versions are special (they have their own unique meanings). In a VCS, changes have an actual <em>history</em>, where one event led to another, in a backup there's just a string of unrelated events.</p>

<p>Closely related to this, is the notion of <em>change metadata</em>. In a VCS, every change has an <em>author</em>, a <em>timestamp</em> and, most importantly, a <em>commit message</em>. This commit message records <em>why</em> the change was made, in other words, it records the ""meaning"" I wrote about in the previous paragraph.</p>

<p>The <em>commit history</em> and especially the <em>commit messages</em> are the most important data in a VCS repository, not the actual code itself! This metadata is completely absent in a backup.</p>

<p>That there is the key word in your question: ""look"". Can you also make them <em>type</em> the same for blind people using a Braille reader?

<p>That word, ""look"", is a very dangerous word – when you use that in relation to HTML, all alarms should go off in your head. HTML is a language for describing the semantic structure of a hypermedia document. A semantic structure doesn't <em>have</em> a ""look"", it's an abstract concept.</p>

<p>Even if you don't care about all this semantic hocuspocus and you don't care about blind people, consider this: Google, Yahoo, MSN and Co. don't have eyes, they don't ""look"" at your rendered CSS.</p>

"<p>I was wondering if there is such a thing as regular expressions for sequential data that isn't a string.</p>

<p>I know that regular expressions essentially boil down to DFAs, but I'm more interested in higher-level languages for specifying these DFAs.</p>
","2988","J&#246;rg W Mittag","<p>There is absolutely nothing in the theory of regular expressions that prevents them from being applied to something else than just strings of characters. It's just that most regular expression engine implementations don't allow that.</p>

<p>However, if you have a regular expression engine that allows you to treat a string as un-encoded 8-Bit data (sometimes called <code>BINARY</code>, <code>8BIT</code> or <code>ASCII-8BIT</code>), then you can use that engine to parse byte-oriented binary data.</p>

<p><a href=""http://CompLang.Org/ragel/"" rel=""nofollow"">Ragel</a> is a state machine compiler that is specifically designed for parsing binary protocols. You write your state machine in a high-level (regexp-like) DSL and Ragel then compiles that into your target language – Ragel currently supports C, C++, Objective-C, D, Java and Ruby.</p>

<p>Most functional programming languages have powerful pattern matching facilities baked right into the language itself. those facilities can be used to pattern match binary data. One example of this is Erlang's support for <a href=""http://Erlang.Se/euc/00/bit%5Fsyntax.html"" rel=""nofollow"">building and pattern matching binary data structures</a>.</p>

<p><a href=""http://TinLizzie.Org/ometa/"" rel=""nofollow"">OMeta</a> is a pattern matching and pattern transformation language that is basically a superset of regular expressions, on steroids.

"<p>I've noticed that there are awvully few programming tutorials in my native language (Latvian). And one of the best ones seems to have gone permanently offline recently. As such I'm ever more inclined to start writing my own programming tutorial.</p>

<p>Since I'm no writer and free time is scarce, I thought of making this a wiki-thing. This way other interested enthusiasts (I already know a few) could also join in easily.</p>

<p>The question is - <strong>which wiki software out there is best suited for such a task?</strong> I've a few key features in mind that would be nice to have, I'll list them here:</p>

<ul>
<li>Full Unicode support, since Latvian has some nonstandard characters in it;</li>
<li>Revision control;</li>
<li>Access control (with anonymous access supported);</li>
<li>Code syntax coloring, preferably extensible so that tutorials for different programming languages can be made;</li>
<li>Automatic TOC generation from all the pages would be nice (but can be done by hand too);</li>
<li>Support for diagrams and mathematical formulas would be nice (but can also be done with picture uploads);</li>
<li>The ability to provide a ""printable"" version for pages would be nice, not to mention a possibility to compile the whole thing in a downloadable e-book.</li>
</ul>

<p>The server that I have has Linux on it, so preferably no ASP/ASP.NET - but that can be arranged too if really needed.</p>

<p><strong>Added:</strong> Well, it seems that there are really just two good candidates - DokuWiki and MediaWiki.  Both have the great feature of already having a Latvian localization. I'd go for MediaWiki, as it seems to have at least one major advantage - versioning of attachments.

","2988","J&#246;rg W Mittag","<p>The question has already been answered, so I'm just gonna make a brief remark: in your question, you use the terms ""folder"" and ""directory"" interchangeably. Those two are very different, and in my experience 99% of all problems with Unix permissions have to do with confusing the two. Remember: Unix has directories, not folders.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>EDIT: a folder is two pieces of cardboard glued together, that <em>contain</em> files. So, a folder is a container, it actually physically contains the files it holds. So, obviously a file can only be in one container at a time. To rename a file, you not only need access to the folder, you also need access to the file. Same to delete a file.</p>

<p>A directory, OTOH, is <em>itself</em> a file. <em>[This is, in fact, exactly how directories were implemented in older Unix filesystems: just regular files with a special flag, you could even open them up in an editor and change them.]</em> It contains a list of mappings from name to location (think phone directory, or a large warehouse). <em>[In Unix, these mappings are called <strong>links</strong> or <strong>hardlinks</strong>.]</em> Since the directory only contains the names of the files, not the files themselves, the same file can be present in multiple directories under different names. To change the name of a file (or more precisely to change <em>a</em> name of a file, since it can have more than one), you only need write access to the directory, not the file. Same to delete a file. Well, actually, you <em>can't</em> delete a file, you can only delete an entry in the directory – there could still be other entries in other directories pointing to that file. <em>[That's why the syscall/library function to delete a file is called <code>unlink</code> and not <code>delete</code>: because you just remove the link, not the file itself; the file gets automatically ""garbage collected"" if there are no more links pointing to it.]</em></p>

<p>That's why I believe the folder metaphor for Unix directories is wrong, and even dangerous. The number one security question on one of the Unix mailinglists I'm on, is ""Why can A delete B's files, even though he doesn't have write access to them?"" and the answer is, he only needs write access to the directory. So, because of the folder metaphor, people think that their files are safe, even if they are not. With the directory metaphor, it would be much easier to explain what's going on: if I want to delete you from my phonebook, I don't have to hunt you down and kill you, I just need a pencil!</p>

"<p>When trying to do something fairly advanced in C# (like some sort of hack), the concept of ""first class"" is raised.</p>

<p>For example, a method is a first class programming construct because you can do xyz with it (xyz is not what the method does, but what a method in general gives you, I can't remember what xyz was now), but in .NET 1.1 delegates were not able to be passed into methods because they were not first class programming constructs (I read something along these lines).</p>

<p>I always thought assembly was a fixed language based on your CPU (with different compilers and languages based on said CPU) so that for your CPU you could only use this type of assembly to talk to your hardware.</p>

<p>But based on that quote, there could be other languages that use other symbols to represent the same numeric machine code.</p>

","2988","J&#246;rg W Mittag","<p>Sure, there are lots of languages that talk directly to the hardware that are not assembly. For example, on the Burroughs B5000, the CPU was programmed in a variant of ALGOL, on the Lisp Machine, the CPU executed Lisp code directly, on the early Smalltalk workstations the CPU executed Smalltalk bytecode directly. Researchers have built CPUs based on graph-reduction engines that execute Lambda Calculus directly. There's more than one company that build Java processors, which are of course programmed in JVM bytecode.</p>

"<p>I have looked for a <strong>good</strong> example of a <strong>Builder pattern</strong> (in C#), but cannot find one either because I don't understand the Builder pattern or I am trying to do something that was never intended.  For example, if I have an abstract automobile and abstract builder methods to create car parts, I should be able to send all 30 of my choices to the Director, have it build the pieces I need, then build my automobile.  Regardless of which car, truck, semi, etc. produced, I should be able to ""drive"" it in exactly the same way.</p>

<p>First problem is most examples hard code property values in to the concrete parts, which I really think should come from a database.  I thought the idea was to send my choices to the Director (from a data source) and have the builder create a customized product based on my data.</p>

<p>Second problem is I want the builder methods to actually create the parts then assign them to the product, not pass strings but real strongly typed product parts.</p>

<p>For example, I want to create a form on the fly by having a Builder manufacture form fields for me, including a label, an input section, validation, etc.  This way I can read the object from my ORM, check out the object's metadata, pass this to my Builder and add the newly created user control result to my web form.</p>

<p>However, every Builder example I find only has hard coded data instead of passing choices from the main code to the Builder and kicking out a customized product.  Everything seems to be a big static case statement.  For example, if I have three parameters with 10 choices each, I don't want to build 30 concrete Builder methods, I want to create only enough to manufacture the properties my product requires, which may be only three.</p>

<p>I am tempted to have the Director exist in the main code only.  There should be a way to automatically determine which concrete builder method to call similar to polymorphism and method overloads (although that is a very bad example) instead of using a case statement within the pattern.  (Every time I need to add a new product type, I will need to modify the existing Director, which is bad).</p>
","2988","J&#246;rg W Mittag","<p>I've never thought about it this way, but LINQ (the pattern, not the syntax) is actually a builder, right?</p>

"<p>I'm looking for real world examples of some bad side effects of code coverage.</p>

<p>I noticed this happening at work recently because of a policy to achieve 100% code coverage. Code quality has been improving for sure but conversely the testers seem to be writing more lax test plans because 'well the code is fully unit tested'. Some logical bugs managed to slip through as a result. They were a REALLY BIG PAIN to debug because 'well the code is fully unit tested'.</p>

<p>I think that was partly because our tool did statement coverage only. Still, it could have been time better spent.</p>

<p>If anyone has other negative side effects of having a code coverage policy please share. I'd like to know what kind of other 'problems' are happening out there in the real-world.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>EDIT: Thanks for all the really good responses. There are a few which I would mark as the answer but I can only mark one unfortunately.</p>
","2988","J&#246;rg W Mittag","<p>One of the largest pitfalls of code coverage is that people just talk about code coverage without actually specifying <em>what</em> type of code coverage they are talking about. The characteristics of C0, C1, C2 and even higher levels of code coverage are <em>very</em> different, so just talking about ""code coverage"" doesn't even make sense.</p>

<p>For example, achieving 100% full path coverage is pretty much impossible. If your program has <code>n</code> decision points, you need 2<sup>n</sup> tests (and depending on the definition, every single bit in a value is a decision point, so to achieve 100% full path coverage for an extremely simple function that just adds two <code>int</code>s, you need 18446744073709551616 tests). If you only have <em>one</em> loop, you already need <em>infinitely many</em> tests.</p>

<p>OTOH, achieving 100% C0 coverage is trivial.</p>

<p>Another important thing to remember, is that code coverage does <em>not</em> tell you what code was tested. It only tells you what code was <em>run</em>! You can try it out yourself: take a codebase that has 100% code coverage. Remove all the assertions from the tests. Now the codebase <em>still</em> has 100% coverage, but does not test a single thing! So, code coverage does not tell you what's tested, only what's not tested.</p>

<p><strong>How can you use SED to edit the file and not giving me an empty file?</strong></p>
","2988","","<p>You are using the wrong tool for the job. <a href=""http://OpenGroup.Org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/sed.html""><code>sed</code></a> is a <em>stream</em> editor (that's why it's called <strong>s</strong><code>ed</code>), so it's for in-flight editing of streams in a pipe. <a href=""http://OpenGroup.Org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/ed.html""><code>ed</code></a> OTOH is a <em>file</em> editor, which can do everything <code>sed</code> can do, except it works on files instead of streams. (Actually, it's the other way round: <code>ed</code> is the original utility and <code>sed</code> is a clone that avoids having to create temporary files for streams.)</p>

<p><code>ed</code> works very much like <code>sed</code> (because <code>sed</code> is just a clone), but with one important difference: you can move around in files, but you can't move around in streams. So, all commands in <code>ed</code> take an address parameter that tells <code>ed</code>, <em>where</em> in the file to apply the command. In your case, you want to apply the command <em>everywhere</em> in the file, so the address parameter is just <code>,</code> because <code>a,b</code> means ""from line <code>a</code> to line <code>b</code>"" and the default for <code>a</code> is <code>1</code> (beginning-of-file) and the default for <code>b</code> is <code>$</code> (end-of-file), so leaving them both out means ""from beginning-of-file to end-of-file"". Then comes the <code>s</code> (for substitute) and the rest looks much like <code>sed</code>.</p>

<p>So, your <code>sed</code> command <code>s/SO/so/</code> turns into the ed command <code>,s/SO/so/</code>.</p>

<p>And, again because <code>ed</code> is a file editor, and more precisely, an interactive file editor, we also need to write (<code>w</code>) the file and quit (<code>q</code>) the editor.</p>

<p>This is how it looks in its entirety:</p>

<pre><code>ed -- so/app.yaml &lt;&lt;-HERE
    ,s/SO/so/
    w
    q
HERE
</code></pre>

<p>See also <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/703459/#703535"">my answer</a> to a similar question.</p>

<p>What happens in your case, is that executing a pipeline is a two-stage process: first construct the pipeline, then run it. <code>&gt;</code> means ""open the file, <em>truncate</em> it, and connect it to filedescriptor 1 (<code>stdout</code>)"". <em>Only then</em> is the pipe actually run, i.e. sed is executed, but at this time, the file has already been truncated.</p>

<p>Some versions of <code>sed</code> also have a <code>-i</code> parameter for in-place editing of files, that makes <code>sed</code> behave a little more like <code>ed</code>, but using that is not advisable: first of all, it doesn't support all the features of <code>ed</code>, but more importantly, it is a non-standardized proprietary extension of GNU <code>sed</code> that doesn't work on many non-GNU systems. It's been a while since I used a non-GNU system, but last I used one, neither Solaris nor OpenBSD nor HP-UX nor IBM AIX <code>sed</code> supported the <code>-i</code> parameter.</p>

"<p>I'm trying to get my head around TDD methodology and have run into - what I think is - a chicken-and-egg problem: what to do if a bug fix involves the changing of a method's signature.</p>

<p>Consider the following method signature: </p>

<pre><code>string RemoveTokenFromString (string delimited, string token)
</code></pre>

<p>As the name suggests, this method removes all instances of a <code>token</code> from <code>delimited</code> and returns the resultant string. </p>

<p>I find later that this method has a bug (e.g. the wrong bits are being removed from the string). So I write a test case describing the scenario where the bug occurs and make sure that the test fails.</p>

<p>When fixing the bug, I find that the method needs more information to be able to do its job properly - and this bit of information can only be sent in as a parameter (the method under test is part of a static class).</p>

<p>What do I do then? If I fix the bug, this compels me to change the unit test - would that be 'correct' TDD methodology?  </p>
","2988","","<p>You have fallen into the most dangerous trap in TDD: you think TDD is about testing, but it isn't. However, it is easy to fall into that trap, since all the terminology in TDD is about testing. This is why BDD was invented: it is essentially TDD, but without the confusing terminology.</p>

<p>In TDD, tests aren't really tests, they are examples. And assertions aren't really assertions, they are expectations. And you aren't dealing with units, you are dealing with behaviors. BDD just calls them that. (Note: BDD has evolved since it was first invented, and it now incorporates things that aren't part of TDD, but the original intention was just ""many people do TDD wrong, so use different words to help them do it right"".)</p>

<p>Anyway, if you think of a test not as a test, but a behavioral example of how the method should work, it should become obvious that as you develop a better understanding of the expected behavior, deleting or changing the test is not only allowed by TDD, it is <em>the only correct choice</em>! Always keep that in mind!</p>

"<p>My question boils down to : <em>“Why not use exception (or error) handling for regular program flow?""</em></p>

<p>To avoid all standard-answers I could have Googled on, I will provide an example you all can attack at will.</p>

<p>C# and Java (and too many others) have with plenty of types some of ‘overflow’ behaviour I don’t like at all (e.g <code>type.MaxValue + type.SmallestValue == type.MinValue</code> for example :  <code>int.MaxValue + 1 == int.MinValue</code>).</p>

<p>But, seen my vicious nature, I’ll add some insult to this injury by expanding this behaviour to, let’s say an Overridden <code>DateTime</code> type. (I know <code>DateTime</code> is sealed in .NET, but for the sake of this example, I’m using a pseudo language that is exactly like C#, except for the fact that DateTime isn’t sealed).</p>

<p>The overridden <code>Add</code> method: </p>

<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Increments this date with a timespan, but loops when
/// the maximum value for datetime is exceeded.
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
/// &lt;param name=""ts""&gt;The timespan to (try to) add&lt;/param&gt;
/// &lt;returns&gt;The Date, incremented with the given timespan. 
/// If DateTime.MaxValue is exceeded, the sum wil 'overflow' and 
/// continue from DateTime.MinValue. 
/// &lt;/returns&gt;
public DateTime override Add(TimeSpan ts) 
{
    try
    {                
        return base.Add(ts);
    }
    catch (ArgumentOutOfRangeException nb)
    {
        // calculate how much the MaxValue is exceeded
        // regular program flow
        TimeSpan saldo = ts - (base.MaxValue - this);
        return DateTime.MinValue.Add(saldo)                         
    }
    catch(Exception anyOther) 
    {
        // 'real' exception handling.
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Of course an if could solve this just as easy, but the fact remains that I just fail to see why you couldn’t use exceptions (logically that is, I can see that when performance is an issue that in certain cases exceptions should be avoided).</p>

<p>I think in many cases they are more clear than if-structures and don’t break any contract the method is making.</p>

<p>IMHO (In My Honest Opinion) the “Never use them for regular program flow” reaction everybody seems to have is not that well underbuild as the strength of that reaction can justify.</p>

<p>Or am I mistaken?</p>

<p>I've read other posts, dealing with all kind of special cases, but my point is there's nothing wrong with it if you are both:</p>

<ol>
<li>Clear</li>
<li>Honour the contract of your method</li>
</ol>

<p>Shoot me.</p>
","2988","","<p>I don't think there is anything wrong with using Exceptions for flow-control. Exceptions are somewhat similar to continuations and in statically typed languages, Exceptions are more powerful than continuations, so, if you need continuations but your language doesn't have them, you can use Exceptions to implement them.</p>

<p>Well, actually, if you need continuations and your language doesn't have them, you chose the wrong language and you should rather be using a different one. But sometimes you don't have a choice: client-side web programming is <em>the</em> prime example – there's just no way to get around JavaScript.</p>

<p>An example: <a href=""http://LiveLabs.Com/volta/"" rel=""nofollow"">Microsoft Volta</a> is a project to allow writing web applications in straight-forward .NET, and let the framework take care of figuring out which bits need to run where. One consequence of this is that Volta needs to be able to compile CIL to JavaScript, so that you can run code on the client. However, there is a problem: .NET has multithreading, JavaScript doesn't. So, Volta implements continuations in JavaScript using JavaScript Exceptions, then implements .NET Threads using those continuations. That way, Volta applications that use threads can be compiled to run in an unmodified browser – no Silverlight needed.</p>

","2988","","<p>I just realized that none of the other answers touch the most trivial aspect of the question: why the <code>#</code> sign?</p>

<p>I have two theories:</p>

<ol>
<li>It might come from Smalltalk, where symbols are written <code>#sym</code> (instead of <code>:sym</code>) as they are in Ruby. So, if you want to <em>refer</em> to a Method <em>object</em> (as opposed to <em>calling</em> a method), then you would call something like <code>Array &gt;&gt; #new.</code> (The <code>&gt;&gt;</code> is itself a method that returns the method passed to it. So, in Ruby that would be <code>Array.method :new</code>.) In Smalltalk documentation, methods are generally referred to as <code>Class&gt;&gt;method</code>, but in Ruby <code>Class:method</code> would have made more sense, except that it is easily confused with <code>Class::method</code>. Therefore, <code>Class#method</code> was chosen.</li>
<li>My other theory is that it simply was chosen because <code>#</code> is the comment character in Ruby.</li>
</ol>

<p>A definitive answer can only be given by whoever invented that convention. If it was invented for the <em>Programming Ruby</em> book, that would be either Dave Thomas or Andy Hunt, but I kind of doubt that. The book came out in 2001, Ruby started in 1993, how were they referring to methods before then?</p>

","2988","","<p>I don't know C# at all, so anything I say about C# should be taken with a grain of salt. However, I will try to explain what goes on in that piece of Ruby code.</p>

<pre><code>class &lt;&lt; Cache
</code></pre>

<p>Ruby has something called <em>singleton methods</em>. These have nothing to do with the Singleton Software Design Pattern, they are just methods that are defined for one and only one object. So, you can have two instances of the same class, and add methods to one of those two objects.</p>

<p>There are two different syntaxes for singleton methods. One is to just prefix the name of the method with the object, so <code>def foo.bar(baz)</code> would define a method <code>bar</code> only for object <code>foo</code>. The other method is called <em>opening up the singleton class</em> and it looks syntactically similar to defining a class, because that's also what happens semantically: singleton methods actually live in an invisible class that gets inserted between the object and its actual class in the class hierarchy.</p>

<p>This syntax looks like this: <code>class &lt;&lt; foo</code>. This opens up the singleton class of object <code>foo</code> and every method defined inside of that class body becomes a singleton method of object <code>foo</code>.</p>

<p>Why is this used here? Well, Ruby is a pure object-oriented language, which means that <em>everything</em>, including classes is an object. Now, if methods can be added to individual objects, and classes are objects, this means that methods can be added to individual classes. In other words, Ruby has no need for the artificial distinction between regular methods and static methods (which are a fraud, anyway: they aren't really methods, just glorified procedures). What is a static method in C#, is just a regular method on a class object's singleton class.</p>

<p>All of this is just a longwinded way of explaining that everything defined between <code>class &lt;&lt; Cache</code> and its corresponding <code>end</code> becomes <code>static</code>.</p>

<pre><code>  STALE_REFRESH = 1
  STALE_CREATED = 2
</code></pre>

<p>In Ruby, every variable that starts with a capital letter, is actually a constant. However, in this case we won't translate these as <code>static const</code> fields, but rather an <code>enum</code>, because that's how they are used.</p>

<pre><code>  # Caches data received from a block
  #
  # The difference between this method and usual Cache.get
  # is following: this method caches data and allows user
  # to re-generate data when it is expired w/o running
  # data generation code more than once so dog-pile effect
  # won't bring our servers down
  #
  def smart_get(key, ttl = nil, generation_time = 30.seconds)
</code></pre>

<p>This method has three parameters (four actually, we will see exactly <em>why</em> later), two of them are optional (<code>ttl</code> and <code>generation_time</code>). Both of them have a default value, however, in the case of <code>ttl</code> the default value isn't really used, it serves more as a marker to find out whether the argument was passed in or not.</p>

<p><code>30.seconds</code> is an extension that the <code>ActiveSupport</code> library adds to the <code>Integer</code> class. It doesn't actually do anything, it just returns <code>self</code>. It is used in this case just to make the method definition more readable. (There are other methods which do something more useful, e.g. <code>Integer#minutes</code>, which returns <code>self * 60</code> and <code>Integer#hours</code> and so on.) We will use this as an indication, that the type of the parameter should not be <code>int</code> but rather <code>System.TimeSpan</code>.</p>

<pre><code>    # Fallback to default caching approach if no ttl given
    return get(key) { yield } unless ttl
</code></pre>

<p>This contains several complex Ruby constructs. Let's start with the easiest one: trailing conditional modifiers. If a conditional body contains only one expression, then the conditional can be appended to the end of the expression. So, instead of saying <code>if a &gt; b then foo end</code> you can also say <code>foo if a &gt; b</code>. So, the above is equivalent to <code>unless ttl then return get(key) { yield } end</code>.</p>

<p>The next one is also easy: <code>unless</code> is just syntactic sugar for <code>if not</code>. So, we are now at <code>if not ttl then return get(key) { yield } end</code></p>

<p>Third is Ruby's truth system. In Ruby, truth is pretty simple. Actually, falseness is pretty simple, and truth falls out naturally: the special keyword <code>false</code> is false, and the special keyword <code>nil</code> is false, everything else is true. So, in this case the conditional will <em>only</em> be true, if <code>ttl</code> is either <code>false</code> or <code>nil</code>. <code>false</code> isn't a terrible sensible value for a timespan, so the only interesting one is <code>nil</code>. The snippet would have been more clearly written like this: <code>if ttl.nil? then return get(key) { yield } end</code>. Since the default value for the <code>ttl</code> parameter is <code>nil</code>, this conditional is true, if no argument was passed in for <code>ttl</code>. So, the conditional is used to figure out with how many arguments the method was called, which means that we are not going to translate it as a conditional but rather as a method overload.</p>

<p>Now, on to the <code>yield</code>. In Ruby, every method can accept an implicit code block as an argument. That's why I wrote above that the method actually takes <em>four</em> arguments, not three. A code block is just an anonymous piece of code that can be passed around, stored in a variable, and invoked later on. Ruby inherits blocks from Smalltalk, but the concept dates all the way back to 1958, to Lisp's lambda expressions. At the mention of anonymous code blocks, but at the very least now, at the mention of lambda expressions, you should know how to represent this implicit fourth method parameter: a delegate type, more specifically, a <code>Func</code>.</p>

<p>So, what's <code>yield</code> do? It transfers control to the block. It's basically just a very convenient way of invoking a block, without having to explicitly store it in a variable and then calling it.</p>

<pre><code>    # Create window for data refresh
    real_ttl = ttl + generation_time * 2
    stale_key = ""#{key}.stale""
</code></pre>

<p>This <code>#{foo}</code> syntax is called <em>string interpolation</em>. It means ""replace the token inside the string with whatever the result of evaluating the expression between the braces"". It's just a very concise version of <code>String.Format()</code>, which is exactly what we are going to translate it to.</p>

<pre><code>    # Try to get data from memcache
    value = get(key)
    stale = get(stale_key)

    # If stale key has expired, it is time to re-generate our data
    unless stale
      put(stale_key, STALE_REFRESH, generation_time) # lock
      value = nil # force data re-generation
    end

    # If no data retrieved or data re-generation forced, re-generate data and reset stale key
    unless value
      value = yield
      put(key, value, real_ttl)
      put(stale_key, STALE_CREATED, ttl) # unlock
    end

    return value
  end

Let's suppose right now I want to support Bazaar and Git. Let's suppose the program will be executed with some kind of argument indicating which version control software is being used.</p>

<p>Given this, I want to make a LogFileReaderFactory which given the name of a version control program will return an appropriate log file reader (subclassed from a generic) to read the log file and spit out a canonical internal representation. So, of course, I can make BazaarLogFileReader and GitLogFileReader and hard-code them into the program, but I want it to be set up in such a way that adding support for a new version control program is as simple as plopping a new class file in the directory with the Bazaar and Git readers.</p>

<p>So, right now you can call ""do-something-with-the-log --software git"" and ""do-something-with-the-log --software bazaar"" because there are log readers for those. What I want is for it to be possible to simply add a SVNLogFileReader class and file to the same directory and automatically be able to call ""do-something-with-the-log --software svn"" without ANY changes to the rest of the program. (The files can of course be named with a specific pattern and globbed in the require call.)</p>

def LogFileReader type
</code></pre>

<p>Here, we create a global method (more like a procedure, actually) called <code>LogFileReader</code>, which is the same name as our module <code>LogFileReader</code>. This is legal in Ruby. The ambiguity is resolved like this: the module will always be preferred, except when it's obviously a method call, i.e. you either put parentheses at the end (<code>Foo()</code>) or pass an argument (<code>Foo :bar</code>).</p>

<p>This is a trick that is used in a few places in the stdlib, and also in Camping and other frameworks. Because things like <code>include</code> or <code>extend</code> aren't actually keywords, but ordinary methods that take ordinary parameters, you don't have to pass them an actual <code>Module</code> as an argument, you can also pass anything that <em>evaluates</em> to a <code>Module</code>. In fact, this even works for inheritance, it is perfectly legal to write <code>class Foo &lt; some_method_that_returns_a_class(:some, :params)</code>.</p>

<p>With this trick, you can make it look like you are inheriting from a generic class, even though Ruby doesn't have generics. It's used for example in the delegation library, where you do something like <code>class MyFoo &lt; SimpleDelegator(Foo)</code>, and what happens, is that the <code>SimpleDelegator</code> <em>method</em> dynamically creates and returns an anonymous subclass of the <code>SimpleDelegator</code> <em>class</em>, which delegates all method calls to an instance of the <code>Foo</code> class.</p>

<p>We use a similar trick here: we are going to dynamically create a <code>Module</code>, which, when it is mixed into a class, will automatically register that class with the <code>LogFileReader</code> registry.</p>

<pre><code>  LogFileReader.const_set type.to_s.capitalize, Module.new {
</code></pre>

<p>There's a lot going on in just this line. Let's start from the right: <code>Module.new</code> creates a new anonymous module. The block passed to it, becomes the body of the module – it's basically the same as using the <code>module</code> keyword.</p>

<p>Now, on to <code>const_set</code>. It's a method for setting a constant. So, it's the same as saying <code>FOO = :bar</code>, <em>except</em> that we can pass in the name of the constant as a parameter, instead of having to know it in advance. Since we are calling the method on the <code>LogFileReader</code> module, the constant will be defined inside that namespace, IOW it will be named <code>LogFileReader::Something</code>.</p>

<p>So, what <em>is</em> the name of the constant? Well, it's the <code>type</code> argument passed into the method, capitalized. So, when I pass in <code>:cvs</code>, the resulting constant will be <code>LogFileParser::Cvs</code>.</p>

<p>And what do we set the constant to? To our newly created anonymous module, which is now no longer anonymous!</p>

<p>All of this is really just a longwinded way of saying <code>module LogFileReader::Cvs</code>, except that we didn't know the ""Cvs"" part in advance, and thus couldn't have written it that way.</p>

<pre><code>    eigenclass.send :define_method, :included do |klass|
</code></pre>

<p>This is the body of our module. Here, we use <code>define_method</code> to dynamically define a method called <code>included</code>. And we don't actually define the method on the module itself, but on the module's <em>eigenclass</em> (via a small helper method that we defined above), which means that the method will not become an instance method, but rather a ""static"" method (in Java/.NET terms).</p>

<p><code>included</code> is actually a special hook method, that gets called by the Ruby runtime, everytime a module gets included into a class, and the class gets passed in as an argument. So, our newly created module now has a hook method that will inform it whenever it gets included somewhere.</p>

<pre><code>      LogFileReader[type] = klass
</code></pre>

<p>And this is what our hook method does: it registers the class that gets passed into the hook method into the <code>LogFileReader</code> registry. And the key that it registers it under, is the <code>type</code> argument from the <code>LogFileReader</code> method way above, which, thanks to the magic of closures, is actually accessible inside the <code>included</code> method.</p>

<pre><code>    end
    include LogFileReader
</code></pre>

<p>And last but not least, we include the <code>LogFileReader</code> module in the anonymous module. [Note: I forgot this line in the original example.]</p>

<pre><code>  }

<p>This new expanded version allows three different ways of defining <code>LogFileReader</code>s:</p>

<ol>
<li>All classes whose name matches the pattern <code>&lt;Name&gt;LogFileReader</code> will automatically be found and registered as a <code>LogFileReader</code> for <code>:name</code> (see: <code>GitLogFileReader</code>),</li>
<li>All classes that mix in the <code>LogFileReader</code> module and whose name matches the pattern <code>&lt;Name&gt;Whatever</code> will be registered for the <code>:name</code> handler (see: <code>BzrFrobnicator</code>) and</li>
<li>All classes that mix in the <code>LogFileReader(:name)</code> module, will be registered for the <code>:name</code> handler, regardless of their name (see: <code>NameThatDoesntFitThePattern</code>).</li>
</ol>

"<p>I have been extremely naughty. I have been developing a piece of software (I'm the only developer) for a little while (O.K., it's over the course of a few years), but have not used any sort of source control.</p>

<p>I have resolved to use source control (git seems most likely, as the windows tools seem to have come on a lot on the last few months) from now on. What I do have is dated backups of the entire directory of my (.NET) solution.</p>

<p>What I would like to do is automagically have my backups visible in the revision history. It will be messy. Projects and files will have been added/removed over the course of the solution history. I'm not bothered about such problems as what I know to be renamed files being interpreted as removal of a file and addition of a new, unrelated one.</p>

<p>More generally my problem is: I have time ordered copies of a changing directory. Importing the first into git is easy I assume. But, I then want all subsequent copies of the directory to be merged, in date order, one at a time without me having to commit every sub-directory and file individually.</p>

<p>Is this possible, or is it just that I am punished for not using source control from the off?</p>

<p>Edit: If I go ahead with the 'commit all snapshots individually' method manually (there are less than 20 snapshots), is there a way  (as Esko Luontola suggests I might want to) of overriding the commit dates with the dates I have for the snapshot. git commit does not appear to have a flag to allow this. Is there another way (I'm using Vista)?</p>

<p>Edit: In answer to my issue of using the original dates: You have to set the GIT_AUTHOR_DATE and/or GIT_COMMITER_DATE environment variables to override the use of current dates and times when performing the commit.</p>

<p>The reason there are two sets of variables (there are also GIT_(AUTHOR|COMMITER)_(NAME|DATE|EMAIL)) is to distinguish between, say, the author who emails a patch, and the maintainer who is actually doing the commits into the repo.</p>

<p>Note if using git extensions on VS: If you set (export varname=""value"") these variables using the 'git bash' command line, and then switch back to the GUI to do a commit, it seems to ignore them. You have to stay on the command line and run 'git commit' from there.</p>
","2988","","<p>I don't quite know why you don't want to just commit all snapshots individually. I mean, a shell script (or Perl, Python, Ruby, Tcl, whatever) to do that, is probably less than 5 lines of code and less than 10 minutes of work.</p>

<p>Also, there is <a href=""http://Software.Complete.Org/software/wiki/vcs-load-dirs/"" rel=""nofollow""><code>git load-dirs</code></a>, which would allow you to cut that down to maybe 3 lines and 5 minutes. But you still have to load every dir indvidually.</p>

<p>But, if you are so inclined, there is the <a href=""http://Kernel.Org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-fast-import.html"" rel=""nofollow""><code>git fast-import</code></a> tool which is intended to make writing repository converters and importers easier. According to the manpage, you could write an importer in about 100 lines and a couple of hours.</p>

<p>However, all this ignores the biggest problem: the <em>value</em> of a VCS lies <em>not</em> in the contents – you could just as well use regular backups for that – but in the commit messages. And no magic tool is going to help you there, you'll have to type them all in yourself … and more importantly, you'll have to remember exactly <em>why</em> you made every single little change over the last years.</p>

"<p>On UNIX, I have to produce numeric results out of previous data by means of various command-line utilities. These utilities read the starting data (in general, but not only, from csv files), perform computations, and write the data (again, in general, but not only, to csv files).</p>

<p>Of course, I don't want to run the risk to have outdated derived data, so I need to chain the data dependency through the utilities. A trivial similarity can be seen with a spreadsheet: when you change a cell, all the other cells that are related change as well, in a cascade fashion. However, due to the more complex and automatized nature of my task, I cannot use a spreadsheet.</p>

<p>Now, the first idea you can have is to use make, which is something I already had experience with. It is trivial, and fits the task well. You are however dependent on files, so if you have a dependency against some data that is stored in a database, you must trick the system. I also know about biomake, but as far as I remember is made in prolog, and I don't want to adventure through that path.</p>

<p>Before I adventure the makefile path, I am interested in additional input from you. 
Does any of you have nice suggestions on how to do this kind of data handling, better utilities than make, and on how to organize the file layout (of the data and the makefiles)?</p>

"<p>This may be a dumb question...but I was just looking into the Mono project and they have a section about installing <a href=""http://mono-project.com/Mono:Windows"">Mono on Windows</a>.  But, since Windows obviously already has the .NET runtime can anyone tell me what exactly is the point of having Mono for Windows?  Does it help with cross platform development or something?</p>
","2988","","<p>There are a couple of features Mono has that .NET doesn't.</p>

<p>Mono is highly modular. You can break it apart in tiny little pieces and only deploy <em>exactly</em> those parts that you need. Don't want System.Xml? Fine, it's gone.</p>

<p>Mono is embeddable. You can host it inside your C/C++ application, to allow users to script it from a safe managed sandboxed environment. The most famous example of this is mod_mono, which hosts Mono inside the Apache webserver, and is how ASP.NET is implemented in Mono, for example. This feature goes great together with the modularization mentioned above.</p>

<p>This has already been mentioned: static linking. <em>Also</em> goes great together with modularization.</p>

<p>Compiler as a Service is another one. Anders Hejlsberg has been talking about it for a <em>long</em> time, and <em>maybe</em>, just maybe it is going to be ready for C# 5.0. Well, Mono already has it, and actually had it for years.</p>

<p>Miguel de Icaza, Mono's Lead Developer also has an initiative that he calls ""Embrace and Extend.NET"", which extends the CLI in ways not (currently) possible with other CLI implementations (including .NET). So far, Embrace and Extend.NET has three features.</p>

<p>Mono.Simd, which gives safe and controlled access to the SIMD instructions of the underlying CPU (e.g. SSE on Intel or AltiVec on PowerPC). Used for Games and Graphics.</p>

<p>64 Bit array indices, which are allowed by the ECMA specification, but Mono is the only VM that actually provides them. Used in supercomputing.</p>

<p>And most recently, continuations. This is actually the first time that Mono strays outside the realm of the specification: long array indices are perfectly valid as per the spec, and Mono.Simd also works on every CLI compliant implementation (albeit <em>very</em> S-L-O-W), but Mono.Tasklet needs special support from the VM that is not part of either CLI or .NET. This is used for game logic and e.g. in Second Life.</p>

","2988","","<p>Actually, it means pretty much exactly what it says: somebody is working in the repository that you are pushing to, and that somebody has currently checked out the exact same branch that you are pushing to.</p>

<p>This is very confusing, because now he thinks that he has checked out the latest version of the branch, when, in fact, you have just updated the branch to a newer version. So, when he now runs <code>git commit</code>, <em>his</em> commit will essentially revert all the commits that you just pushed.

"<p>Functional languages lead to use of recursion to solve a lot of problems, and therefore many of them perform Tail Call Optimization (TCO). TCO causes calls to a function from another function (or itself, in which case this feature is also known as Tail Recursion Elimination, which is a subset of TCO), as the last step of that function, to not need a new stack frame, which decreases overhead and memory usage.</p>

<p>Ruby obviously has ""borrowed"" a number of concepts from functional languages (lambdas, functions like map and so forth, etc.), which makes me curious: Does Ruby perform tail call optimization?</p>
","2988","","<p>No, Ruby doesn't perform TCO. However, it also doesn't <em>not</em> perform TCO.</p>

<p>The Ruby Language Specification doesn't say anything about TCO. It doesn't say you have to do it, but it also doesn't say you <em>can't</em> do it. You just can't <em>rely</em> on it.</p>

<p>This is unlike Scheme, where the Language Specification <em>requires</em> that <em>all</em> Implementations <em>must</em> perform TCO. But it is also unlike Python, where Guido van Rossum has made it very clear on multiple occasions (the last time just a couple of days ago) that Python Implementations <em>should not</em> perform TCO.</p>

<p>Yukihiro Matsumoto is sympathetic to TCO, he just doesn't want to force <em>all</em> Implementations to support it. Unfortunately, this means that you cannot rely on TCO, or if you do, your code will no longer be portable to other Ruby Implementations.</p>

<p>So, some Ruby Implementations perform TCO, but most don't. YARV, for example, supports TCO, although (for the moment) you have to explicitly uncomment a line in the source code and recompile the VM, to activate TCO – in future versions it is going to be on by default, after the implementation proves stable. The Parrot Virtual Machine supports TCO natively, therefore Cardinal could quite easily support it, too. The CLR has some support for TCO, which means that IronRuby and Ruby.NET could probably do it. Rubinius could probably do it, too.</p>

<p>But JRuby and XRuby don't support TCO, and they probably won't, unless the JVM itself gains support for TCO. The problem is this: if you want to have a fast implementation, and fast and seamless integration with Java, then you should be stack-compatible with Java and use the JVM's stack as much as possible. You can quite easily implement TCO with trampolines or explicit continuation-passing style, but then you are no longer using the JVM stack, which means that everytime you want to call into Java or call from Java into Ruby, you have to perform some kind of conversion, which is slow. So, XRuby and JRuby chose to go with speed and Java integration over TCO and continuations (which basically have the same problem).</p>

<p>This applies to all implementations of Ruby that want to tightly integrate with some host platform that doesn't support TCO natively. For example, I guess MacRuby is going to have the same problem.</p>

<p>I was working on an ASP.NET project when I discovered I needed to make an ""experimental"" set of changes which may or may not have been required in the production version.</p>

<p>The obvious thing to do was to create a branch.</p>

<p>However as I was familiar with darcs and svn but not git, I assumed that a clone was the ""normal"" way to create a branch (I now know that <code>git branch</code> would have been more appropriate.)</p>

<p>I continued to work on the experimental change in the clone and, at the same time, other changes in the original repository.</p>

<p>Since then I have discovered that the experimental changes <em>are</em> desirable in the production version and would like to merge the two change sets.</p>

<p>If I had originally done a branch instead of a clone, this would be trivial.  I'm sure it's not too hard to merge between separate repositories, but having looked through the docs I don't think it can be done with a single command (a simple <code>pull</code> does not work.)</p>

<p>I haven't (yet) explicitly configured one repository as a ""remote"" of the other, but I am guessing this will be part of the solution.</p>

<p>The upstream repository at the time did not use any VCS - it was just a directory full of zips with version numbers appended to the file names.</p>

<p>So I would like to know:</p>

<ul>
<li>What's the easiest way to merge the change sets across repositories? (I don't expect any major conflicts.)</li>
<li>Just how harmful is it to clone instead of branching?  Have I lost any information by doing this, e.g. shared history, common dependencies?</li>

"<p>I ask out of ignorance.  It's been over two years since I heard James Duncan Davidson say that Ant needed a successor, something more like a scripting language.  It seemed that Maven 1/Jelly tried to do that, and Maven 2 has tried again in its way (""or the highway""), but without overwhelming success.  Ant seems still to be the default and I continue to use it effectively, but am still frustrated by aspects of it that have to do with it being XML-based.  </p>

<p>I don't mean to discuss <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/80622/maven-or-ant"">Ant vs. Maven</a>, but to ask, is there a successor or alternative that I am unaware of?  </p>

","2988","","<p>I read somewhere (can't remember where, and Google can't either – which is a little suspicious and could mean that I just made that up …) that James Duncan Davidson himself replaced Ant with <a href=""http://Rake.RubyForge.Org/"" rel=""nofollow"">Rake</a> for all his Java work.</p>

"<p>Is it possible to implement the ?? operator in Ruby?</p>

<pre><code>a = nil
b = 1

x = a ?? b # x should == 1
x = b ?? 2 # x should == 1
</code></pre>
","2988","","<p>In Ruby, the short-circuiting Boolean operators (<code>||</code>, <code>&amp;&amp;</code>, <code>and</code> and <code>or</code>) do not return <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>, but rather the first operand that determines the outcome of the entire expression. This works, because Ruby has a rather simple idea of truth. Or rather, it has a rather simple idea of falsehood: <code>nil</code> is false, and obviously <code>false</code> is false. <em>Everything else</em> is true.</p>

<p>So, since <code>||</code> is true when <em>at least one</em> of its operands is true, and operands are evaluated from left to right, this means that <code>a || b</code> returns <code>a</code>, when <code>a</code> is true. But when <code>a</code> is false, then the outcome of the expression is solely dependent on <code>b</code>, and thus <code>b</code> is returned.</p>

<p>That means that, because <code>nil</code> is false, you can just use <code>||</code> instead of <code>??</code> for the examples that you gave. (There is also the nifty <code>a ||= b</code> operator, which kind of works like <code>a || a = b</code>, but not quite.)</p>

<p>However, that <em>only</em> works, because you don't use Booleans in your examples. If you expect to deal with Boolean values, that won't work:</p>

<pre><code>b = false

x = b || 2 # x should be == false, but will be 2
</code></pre>

<p>In that case, you will have to use <code>#nil?</code>, and a conditional expression:</p>

<pre><code>b = false

x = unless b.nil? then b else 2 end # x should be == 2
</code></pre>

<p>or using the ternary conditional operator:</p>

<pre><code>b = false

x = b.nil? ? 2 : b # x should be == false
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to, you can wrap that up in a nice method:</p>

<pre><code>class Object
  def _? b = nil
    return self
  end
end

class NilClass
  def _? b = nil
    return yield if block_given?
    return b
  end
end

b = false

x = b._? { 2 } # x should be == false
x = b._? 2 # x should be == false
</code></pre>

<p>This cute snippet brought to you by polymorphism, open classes and the fact that <code>nil</code> is actually an object <em>representing nothingness</em> (unlike, say, Java, where <code>null</code> <em>is</em> actually nothing).</p>

"<p>Coming from a Python background, where there is always a ""right way to do it"" (a ""Pythonic"" way, if you will) when it comes to style, I'm wondering if the same exists for Ruby. I've kind of been using my own style guidelines but I'm thinking about releasing my source code, and I'd like it to adhere to any unwritten rules that might exist.</p>

<p><strong>So my question is:</strong> Is it ""The Ruby Way"" to explicitly type out <code>return</code> in methods? I've seen it done with and without, but is there a ""right way"" to do it? Is there maybe a ""right <em>time</em>"" to do it? For example:</p>

<pre><code>def some_func(arg1, arg2, etc)
  value = arg1 + arg2 + etc #or whatever
  # Do some stuff...
  return value # &lt;-- Is the 'return' needed here?
end
</code></pre>
","2988","","<p>I personally use the <code>return</code> keyword to distinguish between what I call <em>functional methods</em>, i.e. methods that are executed primarily for their return value, and <em>procedural methods</em> that are executed primarily for their side-effects. So, methods in which the return value is important, get an extra <code>return</code> keyword to draw attention to the return value.</p>

<p>I use the same distinction when <em>calling</em> methods: functional methods get parentheses, procedural methods don't.</p>

<p>And last but not least, I also use that distinction with blocks: functional blocks get curly braces, procedural blocks (i.e. blocks that ""do"" something) get <code>do</code>/<code>end</code>.</p>

<p>However, I try not to be religious about it: with blocks, curly braces and <code>do</code>/<code>end</code> have different precedence, and rather than adding explicit parentheses to disambiguate an expression, I just switch to the other style. The same goes for method calling: if adding parentheses around the parameter list makes the code more readable, I do it, even if the method in question is procedural in nature.</p>

"<p>So I've been using Smalltalk for about 6 months now (Squeak and Pharo), mostly doing data analytics, and I'm about to start my first Seaside app. So my question to all you Smalltalkers out there is, what is your favorite persistence solution? I've been looking at Magma, GOODS, and GLORP. I'm a long-time python hacker, so I get ORM, but it seems like Magma or GOODS would be a better solution, since they seem object-oriented.</p>

<p>A quick note: I want to scale my app across multiple VM's, so just saving data to the image wont really work.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","2988","","<p>If you want to scale across multiple VMs, you might want to to take a look at <a href=""http://GemStone.Com/products/smalltalk/"" rel=""nofollow"">GemStone/S</a>.</p>

<p>Be aware, however, that GemStone is a <a href=""http://Seaside.GemStone.Com/docs/GLASS-Announcement.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">proprietary, commercial product</a>. So, you <em>will</em> have to pay for it. However, the pricing model is generally designed in such a way, that if you <em>need</em> a bigger edition then you will generally also have the users to <em>pay</em> for that edition. The prices start out at 0 $ for the 4 GiByte disk / 1 GiByte RAM / 1 CPU version.</p>

<p>Another thing to note is that GemStone Smalltalk is its own dialect, so your Squeak code will probably not run unmodified, but should be fairly easy to port. (For example, the GemStone engineers have created an adapter that allows you to load Monticello (Squeak's version control system) packages into GemStone/S, also they generally make sure that Seaside runs.)</p>

<p>So, what is GemStone? Basically, it's a distributed VM with automatic object persistence. It's easiest to explain compared to a normal Smalltalk VM. If you have two Smalltalk VMs running side-by-side, each of them has its own Object Memory (i.e. the thing the garbage collector manages). And that Object Memory is in RAM. In GemStone, all VMs in a cluster share the <em>same</em> Object Memory <em>and</em> it lives on disk, not in RAM. So, you don't <em>need</em> a database, not even an object-oriented one, because your objects are ""just there"", everywhere, all the time.</p>

<p>(That's only a very simplistic description. For example, the heap is not <em>really</em> shared across VMs. That wouldn't make sense, you wouldn't want to replicate every temporary object you create across the network. Instead, you have a global repository object (basically, a dictionary) and just like the garbage collector will start at some well-known root object and then keep all objects that are reachable from there, and delete those that aren't, GemStone will start at the global repository object, and persist/replicate <em>only</em> the objects that are reachable from there.)</p>

<p>GemStone also has database-ish features, so access to the global repository is wrapped in ACID transactions, and there is a SQL-inspired but Smalltalkish query language.</p>

<p>GemStone has a nice appliance that they call ""<a href=""http://Seaside.GemStone.Com/"" rel=""nofollow"">GLASS</a>"" (for GemStone, Linux, Apache, Seaside and Smalltalk) analogous to the well-known ""LAMP"" (Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP). GLASS includes the gratis edition of GemStone with Seaside preinstalled and everything setup with Apache running on top of Xubuntu, everything neatly packaged into a VMWare disk image.</p>

"<p>Given the following two ways of defining a class method in Ruby:</p>

<pre><code>class Foo
  class &lt;&lt; self
    def bar
      # ...
    end
  end

  def self.baz
    # ...
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Is there a difference between the two? Is one more preferable than the other?</p>
","2988","","<p>Just to clarify the terminology: there is no such thing as a ""class method"" in Ruby. What you are doing is to define a <em>singleton method</em> on the <em>object</em> that is the class <code>Foo</code> (remember, classes are objects, too, just like any other). In turn, singleton methods don't really exist, either, they are just normal instance methods on the <em>eigenclass</em> (commonly referred to as <code>Foo′</code>) of the object, which in this case is also the metaclass of the class <code>Foo</code>.</p>

<p>Confused yet? :-)</p>

<p>Basically, there is no difference between doing this:</p>

<pre><code>foo = Object.new
class &lt;&lt; foo
  def bar
    # ...
  end
end

def foo.baz
  # ...
end
</code></pre>

<p>and this:</p>

<pre><code>class Foo
  class &lt;&lt; self
    def bar
      # ...
    end
  end

  def self.baz
    # ...
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Because inside a class definition, <code>self</code> is bound to the class object (in this case <code>Foo</code>), that is equivalent to:</p>

<pre><code>class Foo
  class &lt;&lt; Foo
    def bar
      # ...
    end
  end

  def Foo.baz
    # ...
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Which is in turn equivalent to:</p>

<pre><code>Foo = Class.new
class &lt;&lt; Foo
  def bar
    # ...
  end
end

def Foo.baz
  # ...
end
</code></pre>

<p>Which as you can see is pretty much exactly the same as my first example. This shows that there really is no difference between a singleton method on a class method and a singleton method on any other kind of object, therefore it doesn't make sense to talk about ""class methods"" in Ruby.</p>

<p>You can also see how these two notations relate to the notion of singleton methods and eigenclasses:</p>

<pre><code>def foo.baz
  # ...
end
</code></pre>

<p>says ""add the singleton method <code>baz</code> to the object <code>foo</code>"" and </p>

<pre><code>class &lt;&lt; foo
  def bar
    # ...
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>""open up the eigenclass of object <code>foo</code> and then add instance method <code>bar</code> to the eigenclass"". But, as we established earlier, a singleton method of the object and an instance method of the object's eigenclass are really the same thing. That's why it wouldn't make sense for those two notations to behave differently.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You are asking for a language with native code generation, but native code generation has nothing to do with the language, it is a trait of the implementation. <em>Every</em> language can have an implementation with native code generation. Several Python implementations have native code generation. There are C compilers that compile to JVM bytecode, CIL bytecode or even ECMAScript sourcecode. There are even C <em>interpreters</em>. There are also compilers that compile Java sourcecode or JVM bytecode to native code.</p></li>
<li><p>Why do you care about the syntax? It is probably the least important factor about choosing a programming language.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Anyway, <a href=""http://nimrod-lang.org"" rel=""nofollow"">Nimrod</a> is a programming language which has an implementation which supports native code generation (or more precisely an implementation which supports C source code generation) and whose syntax is a hybrid between Wirthian style (by the looks of it the most important influences are Oberon and Delphi) and Python.</p>

<p>However, the fact that it has Pythonic syntax isn't going to help you at all if you don't like European style language design or Wirthian style OOP.</p>

"<p>I've got a bit of an odd situation.  If I were using a hash, this issue would be easy, however, I'm trying to use ""OpenStruct"" in Ruby as it provides some decently cool features.</p>

<p>Basically, I think I need to ""constantize"" a return value.  I've got a regular expression:</p>

<pre><code>  textopts = OpenStruct.new()
  textopts.recipients = []
  fileparts = fhandle.read.split(""&lt;&lt;--&gt;&gt;"")

  fileparts[0].chomp.each{|l|

"<p>When you are designing an application (assumed in English), and you ask the user to provide a path to a directory/folder, do you use the term <strong>Directory</strong> or <strong>Folder</strong>?</p>

","2988","","<p>Please note that they are <em>not</em> synonyms. Directories and Folders behave differently. For example, if you want to remove a File from a Folder, you need access to the Folder <em>and</em> the File, because the File is <em>stored</em> inside the Folder.</p>

<p>If, however, you want to remove a File from a Directory, you need access <em>only</em> to the Directory, because a Directory itself is just a regular File that lists the <em>locations</em> of (but does not <em>contain</em>) other Files. So, you just need to strike out that entry from the Directory, no access to the File is required.</p>

<p>This distinction is pretty important, because false and thus misleading metaphors can be at least confusing and in the worst case pretty dangerous when talking about filesystems.

<p>A great percentage of questions on Unix mailinglists, but also here, on ServerFault and on SuperUser, about what to the asker <em>seems</em> to be confusing filesystem behaviour, can be traced directly back to thinking about Folders, when Unix does in fact have Directories.</p>

"<p>The Ruby on Rails website recommends installing Ruby from source under Linux.
I encountered a number of C library problems building ruby from source on a clean install of Unbuntu 9.</p>

<p>All the instructions I found on the net about installing ruby on ubuntu have involved using the prepackaged (.deb-based) ruby. Clearly this isn't what the rails people recommend.</p>

<p>When I did a clean source build of ruby I found Rubygems failed to install because the zlib extension didn't work.</p>

<p>Two problems occur:</p>

<p>1) The zlib extension isn't built.</p>

<p>Solution:</p>

<p>i) ensure zlib is uncommented in the Setup file within the extn directory of the ruby source, and</p>

<p>ii) ensure these zlib ubuntu packages are installed:</p>

<pre><code>aptitude install zlib1g
aptitude install zlib1g-dbg
aptitude install zlib1g-dev
aptitude install zlibc
</code></pre>

<p>2) After fixing Problem 1 above (and doing a clean rebuild of ruby), zlib still doesn't work because the extension fails to load. </p>

<p>You can see that the module fails to load by running this and getting the output ""false"":</p>

<pre><code>puts require 'zlib'
</code></pre>

<p>I observed this happens to any number of other C extensions in the extn directory, so it appears to be a more general problem with these extensions than just something zlib-specific.</p>

<p>To summarise:</p>

<ul>
<li>My build of ruby finds the ruby-specific C zlib extension but it fails to load the zlib module.</li>
<li>This behaviour appears to happen to other extensions in /extn.</li>
</ul>

<p>Is there a way I can find out why a module fails to load? some kind of trace/verbose mode?</p>
","2988","","<p>I don't see what your problem is. You say that <code>require 'zlib'</code> returns <code>false</code>. But that means that it <em>did</em> work! If there were an error, you would get a <code>LoadError</code> exception.</p>

"<p>The situation: I have multiple classes that should each hold a variable with a configuration hash; a different hash for each class but the same for all instances of a class.</p>

<p>At first, i tried like this</p>

<pre><code>class A
  def self.init config
    @@config = config
  end

  def config
    @@config
  end
end

class B &lt; A; end
class C &lt; A; end
</code></pre>

<p>But soon noticed that it wouldn't work that way because @@config is held in the context of A, not B or C, thus:</p>

<pre><code>B.init ""bar""
p B.new.config  # =&gt; ""bar""
p C.new.config  # =&gt; ""bar"" - which would be nil if B had it's own @@config

C.init ""foo""
p B.new.config  # =&gt; ""foo"" - which would still be ""bar"" if C had it's own @@config
p C.new.config  # =&gt; ""foo""
</code></pre>

<p>I thought of using it like this:</p>

<pre><code>modules = [B, C]
modules.each do |m|
  m.init(@config[m.name])
end
# ...
B.new  # which should then have the correct config
</code></pre>

<p>Now, it's clear to me why that happens, but I'm not sure about the reason for it being like this.</p>

<p>Couldn't it work the other way too, holding the class variable in the context of the subclass?</p>

<p>What i also found irritating was the fact that self is always the subclass even when called 'in' the superclass. From this, I first expected the code from the superclass is ""executed in the context of"" the subclass.</p>

<p>Some enlightenment about this would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I likely have to accept it works that way and that I have to find another way to do this.</p>

<p>Is there a ""meta"" way to do this? (I tried with class_variable_set etc. but with no luck)</p>

<p>Or maybe is the whole idea of that 'init' method flawed in the first place and there's some other ""pattern"" to do this?</p>

<p>I could just make @@config a hash, holding all the configs and always pick the right one, but I find that a little awkward.. (isn't inheritance there to solve this kind of problem? ;)</p>
","2988","","<p>The <code>@@variables</code> aren't class variables. They are <em>class hierarchy variables</em>, i.e. they are shared between the entire class hierarchy, including all subclasses and all instances of all subclasses. (It has been suggested that one should think of <code>@@variables</code> more like <code>$$variables</code>, because they actually have more in common with <code>$globals</code> than with <code>@ivars</code>. That way lies less confusion. Others have gone further and suggest that they should simply be removed from the language.)</p>

<p>Ruby doesn't have class variables in the sense that, say, Java (where they are called static fields) has them. It doesn't <em>need</em> class variables, because classes are also objects, and so they can have <em>instance</em> variables just like any other object. All you have to do is to remove the extraneous <code>@</code>s. (And you will have to provide an accessor method for the class instance variable.)</p>

<pre><code>class A
  def self.init config
    @config = config
  end

  def self.config # This is needed for access from outside
    @config
  end

  def config
    self.class.config # this calls the above accessor on self's class
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Let's simplify this a bit, since <code>A.config</code> is clearly just an attribute_reader:</p>

<pre><code>class A
  class &lt;&lt; self
    def init config
      @config = config
    end

    attr_reader :config
  end

  def config
    self.class.config
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>And, in fact, <code>A.init</code> is just a writer with a funny name, so let's rename it to <code>A.config=</code> and make it a writer, which in turn means that our pair of methods is now just an accessor pair. (Since we changed the API, the test code has to change as well, obviously.)</p>

<pre><code>class A
  class &lt;&lt; self
    attr_accessor :config
  end

  def config
    self.class.config
  end
end

class B &lt; A; end
class C &lt; A; end

B.config = ""bar""
p B.new.config  # =&gt; ""bar""
p C.new.config  # =&gt; nil

C.config = ""foo""
p B.new.config  # =&gt; ""bar""
p C.new.config  # =&gt; ""foo""
</code></pre>

"<p>Why would anybody use the ""standard"" random number generator from <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.random.aspx"">System.Random</a> at all instead of always using the cryptographically secure random number generator from <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.security.cryptography.randomnumbergenerator.aspx"">System.Security.Cryptography.RandomNumberGenerator</a> (or its subclasses because RandomNumberGenerator is abstract)?</p>

<p>Nate Lawson tells us in his Google Tech Talk presentation ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQl0NhW1J0"">Crypto Strikes Back</a>"" at minute 13:11 not to use the ""standard"" random number generators from Python, Java and C# and to instead use the cryptographically secure version.</p>

<p>But what rationale is there to not always use the secure random number generator? Why use System.Random at all? Performance perhaps?</p>
","2988","","<p>The most obvious reasons have already been mentioned, so here's a more obscure one: cryptographic PRNGs typically need to be continually be reseeded with ""real"" entropy. Thus, if you use a CPRNG too often, you could deplete the system's entropy pool, which (depending on the implementation of the CPRNG) will either weaken it (thus allowing an attacker to predict it) or it will block while trying to fill up its entropy pool (thus becoming an attack vector for a DoS attack).</p>

<p>Either way, your application has now become an attack vector for other, totally unrelated applications which – unlike yours – actually vitally <em>depend</em> on the cryptographic properties of the CPRNG.</p>

<p>This is an actual real world problem, BTW, that has been observed on headless servers (which naturally have rather small entropy pools because they lack entropy sources such as mouse and keyboard input) running Linux, where applications incorrectly use the <code>/dev/random</code> kernel CPRNG for all sorts of random numbers, whereas the correct behavior would be to read a small seed value from <code>/dev/urandom</code> and use that to seed their <em>own</em> PRNG.</p>

"<p>I've read a lot about the available .NET unit testing frameworks. What is not clear to me is what are the key features that differentiate the available frameworks. What are the must-have features that you look for when evaluating unit testing frameworks?</p>
","2988","","<p>Developer-facing unit tests (note that I am <em>not</em> talking about customer-facing acceptance tests!) are like production code: they should be written in such a way that it is obvious what they are doing. Indeed, this is even more important for tests than it is for production code, because with production code you have the tests to tell you whether the code works or not, with tests, all you have is reading them and seeing whether they make sense or not.</p>

<p>Therefore, developer-facing unit tests should not need comments. And test names <em>are</em> comments, therefore, your framework should not force you to name your tests.</p>

<p>Here is an example (in RSpec, which of course can also be used on .NET, this time):</p>

<pre><code>describe Array do
  it 'should be empty' do
    Array.new.should be_empty
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>This is just stupid. Any developer that needs a test name to understand what this test is doing should seriously rethink his career choice. Also, all the same problems with comments apply: what if somebody changes the test but forgets to change the name? Now the name is not only useless, but also misleading! This is much better:</p>

<pre><code>describe Array do
  it do
    Array.new.should be_empty
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>RSpec has another nifty trick up its sleeve: it will automatically create an instance of the class you are testing for you, so that you don't have to say <code>ClassUnderTest.new.should</code> again and again, you can just say <code>should</code>:</p>

<pre><code>describe Array do
  it { should be_empty }
end
</code></pre>

<p>And, BTW, just like a developer can figure out what this is testing, so can RSpec. This is what it spits out in all three cases if you ask it for a customer-readable summary of the testsuite:</p>

<pre><code>Array
 - should be empty
</code></pre>

<p><strong>How can you see the major and minor device number from this?</strong></p>
","2988","","<p>An inode uniquely identifies a file on a filesystem. In your example, you are looking at three <em>different</em> filesystems: <code>/</code>, <code>/media/BACKUP_1</code> (presumably an external VFAT32 drive or stick) and <code>/sys</code>.</p>

<p>These are three different filesystems; it is perfectly normal for the same inode number to be used on different filesystems. If inode numbers had to be unique across <em>all</em> filesystems, that would be a pretty harsh requirement, for several reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>there could only be 2<sup><code>sizeof(inode_t)</code> &times; BITS_PER_BYTE</sup> files in the entire world and </li>
<li>every computer on the entire planet would need to be connected to every other computer all the time so that they don't accidentally hand out the same number twice.</li>
</ul>

<p>Just imagine this: you create a file on your external device. Then you detach it and attach it to a different computer, which also creates a file. How would computer A know which inode numbers are already used by computer B?</p>

<p>Also, in your case there is a different peculiarity: <code>/sys</code> is not a ""real"" filesystem, it is a virtual filesystem. It only exposes internal kernel datastructures as files and directories. And it doesn't even do this all the time, it only does this when you actually look at it – then, and only then do the files magically spring into existence. Therefore, its inode numbers are synthesized and don't really have any use at all – indeed, IIRC some virtual filesystems just set the inode number to <code>0</code> for <em>every</em> file, or at least they tried to until they realized that this broke all sorts of tools.</p>

<p>In addition to that, <code>/media/BACKUP_1</code> is presumably a VFAT32 filesystem, which is a DOS filesystem. Inodes are a Unix concept, so VFAT32 doesn't even <em>have</em> inodes, and again they are synthesized.</p>

<p>Indeed, many modern Unix filesystems don't have inodes either, they store files in B<sup>+</sup> trees or some other highly optimized data structure and address them implicitly through their position in the tree. I know that the Reiser4 filesystem had some trouble because in some cases they didn't synthesize inode numbers at all or synthesized very big inode numbers that again broke some tools. (Some stupid implementations of tools which needed to do things similar to <code>find -inode</code> simply built an array from 0 to the highest inode number they could find, which would then consume all available memory on the machine if they were presented with an extremely large inode number.)</p>

<p>However, are you sure that you need a C extension? The thing about C extensions is that every Ruby implementation has their own C extension API (and non-C based ones like XRuby, JRuby, Ruby.NET, IronRuby, HotRuby, MagLev, Red Sun don't have one at all), which means that your C extension will only work on <em>one</em> implementation. And, since MRI <em>only</em> implements Ruby 1.8 and YARV <em>only</em> implements Ruby 1.9, and we are currently in a transition phase between 1.8 and 1.9, chances are that a lot of people will use at least two different implementations. (I personally use 5: MRI, YARV, JRuby, IronRuby and Rubinius.)</p>

<p>Maybe you are better off using <a href=""https://Wiki.GitHub.Com/FFI/FFI/"" rel=""nofollow"">Ruby-FFI</a>. Ruby-FFI is an FFI (Foreign Function Interface) for Ruby (<em>duh</em>), which allows you to bind to and map C libraries in pure Ruby in a manner that is portable across Ruby implementations. The FFI API was first developed by <a href=""http://Blog.FallingSnow.Net/"" rel=""nofollow"">Evan Phoenix</a> as the native extension API for <a href=""http://Rubini.us/"" rel=""nofollow"">Rubinius</a>, it was then adopted by <a href=""http://Blog.Headius.Com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Charles Oliver Nutter</a> (and implemented by <a href=""http://WMeissner.BlogSpot.Com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Wayne Meissner</a>) for <a href=""http://JRuby.Org/"" rel=""nofollow"">JRuby</a>. <a href=""http://WMeissner.BlogSpot.Com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Wayne</a> then also wrote the <a href=""https://Wiki.GitHub.Com/FFI/FFI/"" rel=""nofollow"">Ruby-FFI gem</a>, which contains C extensions for MRI and YARV. <a href=""http://MacRuby.Org/blog/"" rel=""nofollow"">Laurent Sansonetti</a> implemented Ruby-FFI for <a href=""http://MacRuby.Org/"" rel=""nofollow"">MacRuby</a>, <a href=""http://MACournoyer.Com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Marc-André Cournoyer</a>'s <a href=""http://Code.MACournoyer.Com/tinyrb/"" rel=""nofollow"">tinyrb</a> also <a href=""https://GitHub.Com/WMeissner/TinyRb/"" rel=""nofollow"">supports FFI</a> (again written by <a href=""http://WMeissner.BlogSpot.Com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Wayne Meissner</a>) and the <a href=""http://MagLev.GemStone.Com/"" rel=""nofollow"">MagLev</a> developers are also working on it. Which means that if you can make your library work with FFI as opposed to a C extension, you will automatically support 6 Ruby implementations instead of just one.</p>

<p>The only reason to use a C extension as opposed to an FFI extension would be, if you really <em>do</em> want some implementation specific behavior. One example of this would be the <a href=""http://ParseTree.RubyForge.Org/"" rel=""nofollow"">ParseTree</a> gem, which reaches deep into the intestines of MRI and rips out the in-memory representation of the parse tree.</p>

<p>I am particularly having trouble with generic tools which have no real description except their rather generic functional purpose.

","2988","","<p>I don't really have an answer, but three things for you to think about.</p>

<ol>
<li>The late Phil Karlton famously said: ""There are only two hard problems in computer science. Cache Invalidation and Naming Things."" So, the fact that you are having trouble coming up with good names is entirely normal and even expected.</li>
<li>OTOH, having trouble naming things can also be a sign of bad design. (And yes, I am perfectly aware, that #1 and #2 contradict each other. Or maybe one should think of it more like balancing each other.) E.g., if a thing has too many responsibilities, it is pretty much impossible to come up with a good name. (Witness all the ""Service"", ""Util"", ""Model"" and ""Manager"" classes in bad OO designs. Here's an example Google Code Search for <a href=""http://Google.Com/codesearch?q=ManagerFactoryFactory"" rel=""nofollow"">""ManagerFactoryFactory""</a>.)</li>
<li>Also, your names should map to the domain jargon used by subject matter experts. If you can't find a subject matter expert, that's a sign that you are currently worrying about code that you're not supposed to worry about. (Basically, code that implements your core business domain should be implemented and designed well, code in ancillary domains should be implemented and designed so-so, and all other code should not be implemented or designed at all, but bought from a vendor, where what you are buying is <em>their</em> core business domain. [Please interpret ""buy"" and ""vendor"" liberally. Community-developed Free Software is just fine.])</li>
</ol>

<p>Regarding #3 above, you mentioned in another comment that you are currently working on implementing a tree data structure. Unless your company is in the business of selling tree data structures, that is not a part of your core domain. And the reason that you have trouble finding good names could be that you are working outside your core domain. Now, ""selling tree data structures"" may sound stupid, but there <em>are</em> actually companies that do that. For example, the BCL team inside Microsoft's developer division: they actually sell (well, for certain definitions of ""sell"", anyway) the .NET framework's Base Class Libraries, which include, among others, tree data structures. But note that for example Microsoft's C++ compiler team actually (literally) buys <em>their</em> STL from a third-party vendor – they figure that their core domain is writing compilers, and they leave the writing of libraries to a company who considers writing STLs <em>their</em> core domain. (And indeed, AFAIK, that company does <em>nothing but</em> write and sell STL implementations. That's their sole product.)</p>

<p>If, however, selling tree data structures <em>is</em> your core domain, then the names you listed are just fine. They are the names that subject matter experts (programmers, in this case) use when talking about the domain of tree data structures.</p>

Like most <a href=""http://Ruby-Lang.Org/"">Ruby</a> implementations, it is written in the dominant programming language of the underlying platform: <a href=""https://GitHub.Com/RubySpec/MatzRuby/tree/ruby%5F1%5F8/"">MRI</a>, <a href=""https://GitHub.Com/RubySpec/MatzRuby/tree/trunk/"">YARV</a> and <a href=""http://Code.MACournoyer.Com/tinyrb/"">tinyrb</a> are implemented 100% in C, <a href=""http://MacRuby.Org/"">MacRuby</a> mostly in C with a bit of Objective-C, <a href=""http://RubyDotNetCompiler.GoogleCode.Com/"">Ruby.NET</a> and <a href=""http://IronRuby.Net/"">IronRuby</a> 100% in C#, <a href=""http://HotRuby.Accelart.Jp/"">HotRuby</a> in <a href=""http://WWW.ECMA-International.Org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm"">ECMAScript</a>, <a href=""https://GitHub.Com/JonathanBranam/RedSun/"">Red Sun</a> in ActionScript, <a href=""https://GitHub.Com/Cardinal/Cardinal/"">Cardinal</a> in PIR and NQP and so on. (The only <a href=""http://Ruby-Lang.Org/"">Ruby</a> implementations that contain a significant amount of <a href=""http://Ruby-Lang.Org/"">Ruby</a> code are <a href=""http://Rubini.us/"">Rubinius</a> (about 70% <a href=""http://Ruby-Lang.Org/"">Ruby</a>, 30% C++) and <a href=""http://MagLev.GemStone.Com/"">MagLev</a> (unknown amounts of <a href=""http://Ruby-Lang.Org/"">Ruby</a> and <a href=""http://Smalltalk.Org/"">Smalltalk</a>).) And naturally, <a href=""http://XRuby.Com/"">XRuby</a> and <a href=""http://JRuby.Org/"">JRuby</a> are implemented 100% in Java.</p>

<p>Now, the funny thing is, <a href=""http://Blog.Headius.Com/"">Charlie</a> came to <a href=""http://Ruby-Lang.Org/"">Ruby</a>, because he didn't like his day job, doing Java development. And now, he <em>still</em> writes Java code all day long! Of course, he doesn't like that, and so he was looking for another programming language in which to implement the core of <a href=""http://JRuby.Org/"">JRuby</a>. One option would certainly be to just write it all in <a href=""http://Ruby-Lang.Org/"">Ruby</a>, but with <a href=""http://C2.Com/cgi/wiki/?MetaCircularEvaluator"">metacircular implementations</a> there usually comes a point of diminishing returns, where the implementations degenerates into academic masturbation. It would certainly make sense to rewrite the libraries, the ahead-of-time compiler (actually, <a href=""https://GitHub.Com/JRuby/JRuby/blob/master/tool/compiler2.rb"">that's already being done</a>) and some of the core classes in <a href=""http://Ruby-Lang.Org/"">Ruby</a>, but some parts of the engine core are better written in something closer to the execution model of the JVM itself.</p>

<p><a href=""http://Blog.Headius.Com/"">Charlie</a> was looking at the available options: <a href=""http://Scala-Lang.Org/"">Scala</a>, <a href=""http://Groovy.CodeHaus.Org/"">Groovy</a>, <a href=""http://FanDev.Org/"">Fan</a>, <a href=""http://Clojure.Org/"">Clojure</a>, <a href=""http://Nice.SourceForge.Net/"">Nice</a>, but all of them had a significant disadvantage: a fairly large language runtime. The size of the <a href=""http://JRuby.Org/"">JRuby</a> runtime is already a big problem in terms of memory consumption and startup latency (especially compared to <a href=""https://GitHub.Com/RubySpec/MatzRuby/tree/ruby%5F1%5F8/"">MRI</a> or <a href=""https://GitHub.Com/RubySpec/MatzRuby/tree/trunk/"">YARV</a> and even more so if you actually include the JVM itself in your measurements), and rewriting it in a language that adds its <em>own</em> runtime to that weight is simply a no-go. Unfortunately, there was no programming language which satisfied the two basic criteria <a href=""http://Blog.Headius.Com/"">Charlie</a> was looking for: no runtime and compiles to JVM bytecode that is at least as efficient as the equivalent Java.</p>

<p>So, he decided to create his own. The reason why he chose to use a syntax similar to <a href=""http://Ruby-Lang.Org/"">Ruby</a>, is actually quite simple: he didn't need to write a parser for it, <a href=""http://Duby.Kenai.Com/"">Duby</a> just uses <a href=""http://JRuby.Org/"">JRuby</a>'s already existing parser with one minor modification to support method parameter type annotations. (Actually, he also likes <a href=""http://Ruby-Lang.Org/"">Ruby</a>'s syntax, that was of course also a factor.)</p>

<p>As you know the syntax is actually the least important part of a programming language. (Its irrelevance isn't always <em>obvious</em> from the <a href=""http://Google.Com/search?q=Python+indentation+sucks"">amount of arguing about it</a>, but that's just because syntax is the only thing you can argue about without having to actually understand what you are talking about.) Much more important than the syntax is the type system and the evaluation semantics. And here comes the trick: <a href=""http://Duby.Kenai.Com/"">Duby</a> doesn't have either! It <em>only</em> has syntax! It's like a parasite: it simply ""borrows"" the type system and semantics from its underlying platform. That means that on the JVM, <a href=""http://Duby.Kenai.Com/"">Duby</a>'s type system <em>is</em> the Java type system, and <a href=""http://Duby.Kenai.Com/"">Duby</a>'s semantics <em>are</em> Java's semantics. To put it another way: <a href=""http://Duby.Kenai.Com/"">Duby</a> isn't a programming language <em>at all</em>, rather it is ""just"" an alternative syntax for Java.</p>

<p>That means that there is no mapping, no conversion overhead and no speed difference between <a href=""http://Duby.Kenai.Com/"">Duby</a> and Java. And that means that the internals of <a href=""http://JRuby.Org/"">JRuby</a> could be written in <a href=""http://Duby.Kenai.Com/"">Duby</a>, without losing any features.</p>

<p>So, that's <a href=""http://Duby.Kenai.Com/"">Duby</a>.</p>

<p>In order to explain <a href=""https://GitHub.Com/Headius/Surinx/"">Surinx</a>, I'll first answer your first question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1. What's <a href=""http://JCP.Org/en/jsr/detail?id=292"">invokedynamic</a> and why does <a href=""http://Duby.Kenai.Com/"">Duby</a> ""need a playmate""?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""http://JCP.Org/en/jsr/detail?id=292""><code>invokedynamic</code></a> is specifically a new bytecode that is going to be added to the 3rd edition of the JVM specification and that is going to be released in JDK7. However, more generally <a href=""http://JCP.Org/en/jsr/detail?id=292""><code>invokedynamic</code></a> is usually used as a stand-in to refer to a whole bunch of features, of which the <em>actual</em> <a href=""http://JCP.Org/en/jsr/detail?id=292""><code>invokedynamic</code> bytecode</a> is only one, that are currently being developed under the umbrella of <a href=""http://JCP.Org/en/jsr/detail?id=292"">JSR-292 ""Supporting Dynamically Typed Languages on the Java Platform""</a>. And even more generally, the name <a href=""http://JCP.Org/en/jsr/detail?id=292""><code>invokedynamic</code></a> is used as a moniker for the general change of strategy both in Sun and in the JCP as a whole to turn the Java platform into a general purpose language platform for all sorts of languages.</p>

<p>The specific purpose of <a href=""http://JCP.Org/en/jsr/detail?id=292"">JSR-292</a> (which is what <a href=""http://Blog.Headius.Com/"">Charlie</a> alludes to in his blog post), is to make dynamic method dispatch faster – indeed, almost as fast as <em>static</em> dispatch in Java, at least in the best case.</p>

<p><a href=""https://GitHub.Com/Headius/Surinx/"">Surinx</a> is a dynamically typed programming language which basically does the same thing as <a href=""http://Duby.Kenai.Com/"">Duby</a>: like <a href=""http://Duby.Kenai.Com/"">Duby</a>, it <em>also</em> has <em>only</em> syntax, like <a href=""http://Duby.Kenai.Com/"">Duby</a>, it <em>also</em> used the Java type system. But <em>unlike</em> <a href=""http://Duby.Kenai.Com/"">Duby</a>, it does <em>not</em> use <em>Java's</em> method invocation semantics, instead it uses <a href=""http://JCP.Org/en/jsr/detail?id=292""><em><code>invokedynamic</code>s</em></a> method invocation semantics. IOW: it is dynamically typed and uses dynamic dispatch.</p>

<p>So, that's <a href=""https://GitHub.Com/Headius/Surinx/"">Surinx</a>.</p>

<p>Now, I can answer the second half of your third question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>3. Why do we need (need!) […] two more Ruby-related languages?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I already answered for <a href=""http://Duby.Kenai.Com/"">Duby</a>, here's the answer for <a href=""https://GitHub.Com/Headius/Surinx/"">Surinx</a>: it's what <a href=""http://Groovy.CodeHaus.Org/"">Groovy</a> <em>should</em> have been – a lightweight (actually, <em>zero</em>-weight) dynamic expressive scripting language for the JVM. Also, it is currently the simplest way to play around with the inner workings of <a href=""http://JCP.Org/en/jsr/detail?id=292""><code>invokedynamic</code></a>. (The current development snapshots of <a href=""http://JRuby.Headius.Com%3A8080/hudson/job/jruby-dist/"">JRuby 1.4</a> also support it, but that's a much more complex project.)</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>Two things I left out: <a href=""http://Duby.Kenai.Com/"">Duby</a> actually uses local variable type inference, so, unlike Java, you only have to declare the types of method parameters, but everything <em>inside</em> a method will be type-inferred.</p>

<p>And secondly, both <a href=""http://Duby.Kenai.Com/"">Duby</a> and <a href=""https://GitHub.Com/Headius/Surinx/"">Surinx</a> are not actually tied to the JVM. Since they just steal their semantics and type systems from the underlying platform, they can be ported almost anywhere, where you have a rough mapping from <a href=""http://Ruby-Lang.Org/"">Ruby</a> syntax to platform concepts. Off the top of my head, I could imagine ports of <a href=""http://Duby.Kenai.Com/"">Duby</a> to C, C++, Objective-C (iPhone, anyone?), <a href=""http://DigitalMars.Com/d/"">D</a>, <a href=""http://WWW.ECMA-International.Org/publications/standards/Ecma-335.html"">CLI</a> and ActionScript and ports of <a href=""https://GitHub.Com/Headius/Surinx/"">Surinx</a> to the <a href=""http://CodePlex.Com/DLR/"">DLR</a>, <a href=""http://Smalltalk.Org/"">Smalltalk</a>, <a href=""http://ParrotCode.Org/"">Parrot</a>, <a href=""http://WWW.ECMA-International.Org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm"">ECMAScript</a>, <a href=""http://Python.Org/"">Python</a>, <a href=""http://Perl.Com/"">Perl</a>, <a href=""http://PHP.Net/"">PHP</a> and Objectice-C. In fact, there are already the beginnings of a <a href=""http://Kenai.Com/projects/duby/sources/mercurial/content/lib/duby/c/compiler.rb"">C port of Duby</a>.</p>

"<p>I have a script with a factory method that I would like to return a different implementation of some class depending on whether or not the script is running from JRuby or Ruby. Anyone have any ideas on how I could tell the difference from inside my script? </p>

<p>Some initial thoughts I had were:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Attempt to 'include Java' and rescue back to the Ruby implementation if it fails. This method doesn't work. Ruby's smart enough to error out regardless of my begin/rescue/end.</p></li>
<li><p>Do something goofy with process IDs. I'd rather avoid this, since it always feels like a hack.</p></li>
</ul>
","2988","","<p>I don't quite understand your question. You seem to be mixing two completely different abstraction levels: Ruby is a programming language, JRuby is a compiler for the Ruby programming language. The question whether your program is running in Ruby or in JRuby just plain doesn't make sense: when it's running in JRuby, it <em>is</em> running in Ruby, because JRuby is an implementation of Ruby.</p>

<p>It's the same as asking ""how can I tell if I'm driving in a Ford vs. a car?""</p>

<p>If you want to know in what Ruby implementation you're running, then you can check the global <code>RUBY_ENGINE</code> constant. It is supposed to universally and uniquely identify the engine you are running on, although it unfortunately fails for three reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>on some engines, it <em>doesn't</em> tell you what engine it is running on, for example on YARV I would expect <code>RUBY_ENGINE</code> to be <code>'yarv'</code>, but it is actually <code>'ruby'</code>. So, it fails at the ""identify"" part.</li>
<li>even worse: on MRI, it is <em>also</em> <code>'ruby'</code>, which means that not only does it not tell you what engine you are running on, but there also totally <em>different</em> engines that return the <em>same</em> value. IOW, it also fails at the ""unique"" part.</li>
<li>and last but not least, <code>RUBY_ENGINE</code> is fairly new, so it is not yet supported by all engines, which means it fails at the ""universal"" part.</li>
</ol>

<p>Still, for your purposes something like</p>

<pre><code>if defined? RUBY_ENGINE &amp;&amp; RUBY_ENGINE == 'jruby'
</code></pre>

<p>should work fine.</p>

"<p>Can anyone recommend a good gem or library for managing a mailing list with Ruby?  No Rails solutions, if possible, please (I don't want to have ActionWhatever dependencies, this will most likely be done with Ramaze).</p>

<p>I just need basic features, like management of the list itself (CRUD operations on the user list), plus being able to send notifications, welcome messages, and also auto respond to basic things like subscribe and unsubscribe.</p>

<p>Optimally, people should be able to subscribe via both a Ramaze web page (i.e. I'd have Ramaze call/access the lib's API), as well as by sending an email to a specific email address.  But I am willing to forego the operations by email.</p>

<p>I'm willing to entertain non-Ruby, or non-programmatic solutions, if they are good, but the ability to subscribe from a web page [under my control] is a must.</p>

<p>EDIT: Sorry, one important detail I forgot to add: This is intended to be a one-way mailing list.  That is, people should be able to subscribe and unsubscribe alright, but only one person should be allowed to send to the list for broadcasting.</p>
","2988","","<p>I'm not exactly sure about your requirements. If you only need basic features, why do you care what language it is implemented in? You would only need to know this if you need advanced features that you have to implement yourself!</p>

<p>Given your requirements, pretty much <em>any</em> mailing list server will fit the bill.</p>

<p>However, there is a specific suggestion I would like to make, just because I think it is an extremely cool example of a refreshing take on e-mail applications: <a href=""http://LamsonProject.Org/"" rel=""nofollow"">Lamson</a>.</p>

<p>Lamson is <em>not</em> a mailing list server, rather it is an e-mail application development framework (similar to how Rails is a web application development framework). Lamson is not written in Ruby, but in Python, but it is quite simply the best thing that has happened to e-mail since, well, <em>ever</em>. It was written by <a href=""http://ZedShaw.Com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Zed Shaw</a> (of <a href=""http://Mongrel.RubyForge.Org/"" rel=""nofollow"">Mongrel</a> fame), and is based on the premise that just like Rails proved that web development doesn't have to be a PITA, e-mail development doesn't have to be, either. (In that way it is similar to <a href=""http://Adhearsion.Com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Adhearsion</a>, which also took the ideas of Rails and applied to a totally different domain, in this case telephony.)</p>

<p>There is already a mailing list service based on Lamson, called <a href=""http://LibreList.Com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Libre List</a>, which (naturally) hosts the Lamson mailing lists, among others. <a href=""http://Bazaar.LaunchPad.Net/~zedshaw/lamson/development/files/head%3A/examples/librelist/"" rel=""nofollow"">The source code to Libre List</a> is included in the Lamson source distribution as an example.</p>

"<p>In Perl, there is an ability to break an outer cycle like this:</p>

<pre><code>AAA: for my $stuff (@otherstuff) {
         for my $foo (@bar) {
             last AAA if (somethingbad());
         }
      }

<p>(syntax may be wrong), which uses a loop label to break the outer loop from inside the inner loop. Is there anything similar in Ruby?</p>
","2988","","<p>What you want is non-local control-flow, which Ruby has several options for doing:</p>

<ul>
<li>Continuations, </li>
<li>Exceptions, and</li>
<li><code>throw</code>/<code>catch</code></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Continuations</strong></p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
<li>Continuations are the standard mechanism for non-local control-flow. In fact, you can build <em>any</em> non-local control-flow (subroutines, procedures, functions, methods, coroutines, state machines, generators, conditions, exceptions) on top of them: they are pretty much the nicer twin of <code>GOTO</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Continuations are not a mandatory part of the Ruby Language Specification, which means that some implementations (XRuby, JRuby, Ruby.NET, IronRuby) don't implement them. So, you can't rely on them.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Exceptions</strong></p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
<li>There is a paper that proves mathematically that Exceptions can be more powerful than Continuations. IOW: they can do everything that continuations can do, and more, so you can use them as a replacement for continuations.</li>
<li>Exceptions are universally available.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
<li>They are called ""exceptions"" which makes people think that they are ""only for exceptional circumstances"". This means three things: somebody reading your code might not understand it, the implementation might not be optimized for it (and, yes, exceptions <em>are</em> godawful slow in almost any Ruby implementation) and worst of all, you will get sick of all those people constantly, mindlessly babbling ""exceptions are only for exceptional circumstances"", as soon as they glance at your code. (Of course, they won't even try to understand what you are doing.)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><code>throw</code>/<code>catch</code></strong></p>

<p>This is (roughly) what it would look like:</p>

<pre><code>catch :aaa do
  stuff.each do |otherstuff|
    foo.each do |bar|
      throw :aaa if somethingbad
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
<li>The same as exceptions.</li>
<li>In Ruby 1.9, using exceptions for control-flow is actually <em>part of the language specification</em>! Loops, enumerators, iterators and such all use a <code>StopIteration</code> exception for termination.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Ruby community hates them even more than using exceptions for control-flow.</li>
</ul>

"<p>Django as a framework is a neat little package. There are very few files (compared to Rails) and it's got a clean structure. The fact that you can plug and unplug apps between different projects is an extremely nifty feature. At the same time, Ruby's hacking ability is unparalleled. It's complete object-orientedness makes it more expressive and fun.</p>

<p>To cut the story short, is there a Django-like or Django inspired framework on Ruby?
If not, would be possible for an implementation of Django on Ruby? What would be the challenges?</p>

<p>If one were to create a Django-inspired framework for Ruby, how would it's Domain Specific Language (DSL) nature come into play?</p>

<p>I've spent a good chunk of my past life using Symfony, which is a PHP framework heavily inspired from Rails. When I saw Django, it came as a bout of fresh air. I'm really curious to know what you guys think and have to say on this.</p>

<p><strong><em>Update:</strong> I stumbled on a framework call <a href=""http://ramaze.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">Ramaze</a> for Ruby. It seems to be a bare-bones MVC framework with pluggable components for the JS framework, ORM layer and the templating engine. So you could use Prototype / Sequel / Sass, or Mootools / ActiveRecord / XSLT, or any other combination of your choice! As a side-note, Merb is an interesting choice too.</em></p>

<p><strong><em>Update 2:</strong> I'm sticking to PHP for big-ass commercial projects and Django for my personal projects. Reason why I decided to side with Django was the amount of flexibility it offered. That said, I realized that with greater power comes greater responsibility.
My advice to others: if you know exactly what you want - go with Django. It's probably easier to define things explicitly in it than in Rails. Merb may have been a good choice too, but I didn't have the time to explore it. Django seemed like a good fit and so I stopped being anal about the language I'm using.

"<p>I have decided to give a try to TDD and BDD on my already started project, encouraged by answers to questions like this:
<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/294909/should-i-start-using-tdd-on-a-project-that-doesnt-use-it-already"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/294909/should-i-start-using-tdd-on-a-project-that-doesnt-use-it-already</a></p>

<p>I am struggling to really start with it.
My project (opensource, hosted in <a href=""http://gitorious.org/rubots"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gitorious.org/rubots</a>) is game-like and uses Ruby to wrap and connect to a control server and a physical simulation environment. 
The script is executed, then a GUI appears and when the user click on start 2 external c++ programs are launched, one of them being a physical simulation, they are controlled by a library with Ruby bindings. 
There is no way of reseting the simulation and the control program, they should be started again. Start them and have them in a working state takes like 5 seconds. 
On this context any test needs of whole starting phase before anything moves and the simulation depend on external configuration files that should be provided also.</p>

<p>It is really worth it start writing test cases?
How? Every test with a :before or similar that starts the game, launch the applications, etc? Then every test will at least take 5 seconds (and considerably more if I have to commit a command and wait for the entities of the simulation to answer). </p>

<p>Bob comes to visit Ward, who took him down to the basement, where he is staring on little circles on a screen like its the coolest thing in the universe and he is excited like a little kid unwrapping her first bicycle on Christmas.

What he had done, was the following: he had started writing a Unit test in JUnit, using a mock. Then made that test pass, and so on, just like you would normally do. Then he replaced all the methods with ones that generated the appropriate assembly code for the device. Since all the logic was written (and tested) in Java, the ""leaf"" methods themselves were extremely simple methods that only did extremely simple things like ""write an <code>int</code> into a register"" or ""read a <code>bool</code> from a flag register"" for which the assembly code was so simple that it was ""obviously correct"".</p>

<p>And, sure enough, when he assembled his generated code and flashed the device, it worked the very first time, without him having ever tried the code on the device, and also without him having written any substantial assembly code.</p>

<p>So, that's two approaches: in Atomic Object's case they wrote the software in C and the tests in Ruby, and generated <em>tests</em> from the Ruby code. In Ward's case, he wrote the tests <em>and</em> the code in Java, and generated the <em>code</em> from the Java code.</p>

"<p>I always hear about UML being used in Java projects but never in Ruby ones. Is this just a cultural difference or is there less of a need for modeling in Ruby development because it's part of a more 'agile' culture?</p>
","2988","","<p>One of the obvious reasons is that well-designed Ruby programs rely heavily on Mixins, which AFAIK simply cannot be modeled in UML at all. I know that Schärli et al developed an extension to UML that can represent Traits which given the close relationship between Traits and Mixins could probably be adapted or just reused for representing Mixins, but then it's not UML anymore.</p>

"<p>Let's say I have a project that is a class library. I have a class in that library and this class has some methods that are used inside the class only. Like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyClass
{
  public void MyPublicMethod
  {
    int k

    // do something ...

    int z = MyInternalMethod(k);
    // do something else ...

  }

  internal int MyInternalMethod(int i)
  {
        // do something ...

  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now I want to write unit tests for these methods. I would create a ""Unit Tests"" project, reference the nunit from it and write something like this</p>

<pre><code>[TestFixture]
public class UnitTests
{
  private MyClass myClass;

  [SetUp]
  public void SetupTest
  {
    myClass = new MyClass();
  }

  [Test]
  public void TestMyInternalMethod
  {
    int z = 100;
    int k = myClass.MyInternalMethod(z); //CAN NOT DO THIS!
    Assert.AreEqual(k, 100000);
  }

  [TearDown]
  public void TearDown
  {
    myClass = null;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, I can not do this, because of the MyInternalMethod scope. What would be the proper way to handle this situation?</p>
","2988","","<p>There's two cases: either your private methods get called from some public method, in which case you can test them through that method. Or, they don't get called from some public method, in which they cannot be called at all, are dead code, and should be deleted, not tested.</p>

<p>Note that if you are doing TDD, private methods can only spring into existence by extracting them from public methods, in which case they are already tested automatically.</p>

"<p>Our git repositories started out as parts of a single monster svn repository where the individual projects each had their own tree like so:</p>

<p>Obviously, it was pretty easy to move files from one to another with 'svn mv'. In git, each project is in its own repository, and today I was asked to move a subdirectory from project2 to project1. I did something like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone project2 
$ cd project2
$ git filter-branch --subdirectory-filter deeply/buried/java/source/directory/A -- --all

"<p>I am thinking to learn programming language with dynamic type system. </p>

<p>Which one should I learn first? </p>

<p>Criteria:</p>

<ol>
<li>I can learn and start programming in a day or two</li>
<li>Easy, Concise</li>
<li>In few days I should be able to write small scripts for some batch jobs with file systems.</li>
</ol>

<p>To mention, I am normally a quick learner.</p>
","2988","","<p>F# is obviously <em>incredibly</em> bad for learning a language with a dynamic type system, because it doesn't have a dynamic type system. Quite the opposite: it's got a much more advanced <em>static</em> type system than the current mainstream languages, for example Java, C, C++ or its cousins C# and Visual Basic.NET.</p>

<p>As for the other two, I don't think that there is a clear winner.</p>

<p>However, for your first dynamic language, I would recommend <a href=""http://SelfLanguage.Org/"">Self</a>, <a href=""http://NewspeakLanguage.Org/"">Newspeak</a> or <a href=""http://Ioke.Org/"">Ioke</a>. All three of these are <em>incredibly</em> dynamic, much more so than Ruby or Python.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Ioke and Newspeak are very new and Self hasn't been updated in a while (although it has picked up steam in the recent months), so, as an alternative I would suggest <a href=""http://IoLanguage.Com/"">Io</a>.</p>

<p>I personally find that when I want to learn about some new concept, it's easiest to learn it with a language that takes it to the extreme: static typing, functional programming and lazy evaluation in Haskell, OO in Self, class-based OO in Newspeak, syntactic metaprogramming in Scheme, concurrency in Clojure, fault-tolerance in Erlang, Design-by-Contract in Spec#, concatenative programming in Factor and so on.</p>

<p>One of the biggest problems newcomers on the Ruby mailinglists have, is that they are <em>still</em> writing Java, C#, PHP, C++, C, Pascal, but just with Ruby syntax. That won't happen with Self! The language is just too different, so that it will force you to embrace its dynamism. In Ruby or Python you will have to force yourself.</p>

<p>So the question is, are there standard, cross platform, ways to programmatically open the associated application for certain file types. Or at least to find out if there are associated applications and be able to locate and launch them?</p>

<p>By cross platform I mean Windows, OSX and linux (gnome/kde). The use case is having a database with stored files as blobs that will be read on the three different targets.</p>
","2988","","<p>I don't know of any cross-platform way.</p>

<p>In Windows, there is the <code>start</code> command, which will launch the associated default application. (E.g. <code>start foo.doc</code> will launch the default Word document editor, <code>start <a href=""http://StackOverflow.Com/"">http://StackOverflow.Com/</a></code> the default web browser and <code>start mailto:mail@example.com</code> the default mail app.)</p>

<p>In OS X there is the <code>open</code> command, which does the same thing.</p>

<p>Linux is just an Operating System kernel. OS kernels don't know anything about ""filetypes"" or ""MIME types"" or ""associated applications"" or anything like that. Therefore, such a thing simply <em>cannot exist</em> for Linux.</p>

<p>The Freedesktop Group has a <a href=""http://Portland.FreeDesktop.Org/xdg-utils-1.0/xdg-open.html"" rel=""nofollow"">specification for an <code>xdg-open</code> command</a>, which works on all Freedesktop-compliant graphical desktops (be they Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, DragonflyBSD, OpenSolaris or otherwise). However, it is obviously not guaranteed to work on non-Freedesktop systems and it is <em>certainly</em> not guaranteed to work on non-graphical systems.</p>

<p>In all three cases, this is a command line application, not a C or C++ API, but you can obviously call it via <code>system</code>.</p>

"<p>I have a method which returns an File object. I need to know when the file is getting closed. This is not as simple as overwriting the close method. The close method is not called if the file is closed by the destructor.</p>

<p>It should work like this:</p>

<pre><code>def something
    get_lock_on_file
    file File.new(""foobar"")

<p>How do I implement file#on_close(&amp;block) ?</p>
","2988","","<p>I am afraid there is nothing you can do. If the <code>File#close</code> method doesn't get called, then it's somewhat likely that the file will actually only be automatically closed by the operating system, when the Ruby interpreter exits. In other words: at the time that the file is closed, the Ruby interpreter (or at least your program) is long gone, so there is just no way that your program can be notified.</p>

<p>I guess you could achieve some somewhat reasonable coverage by </p>

<ul>
<li>overriding the <code>File</code> object's <code>#close</code> method, </li>
<li>installing your own finalizer and </li>
<li>installing an <code>at_exit</code> handler.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, all of these have their problems: the <code>#close</code> method might not get called. The finalizer is only run when the object is garbage collected, which may be much later than you expect (and if you never run out of memory, then the garbage collector never runs and the finalizer never gets called). And even the <code>at_exit</code> handler is not guaranteed to run, if the interpreter crashes.</p>

","2988","","<p>As Chuck already wrote, <code>File::dirname</code> is a singleton method of the <code>File</code> class object (or more precisely an instance method of the <code>File</code> class object's metaclass), not an instance method of the <code>File</code> class.</p>

<p>So, you have to open up <code>File</code>'s metaclass, not the <code>File</code> class itself:</p>

  a_method(a_signal.new, a_model, a_helper);
  assert_equal(new_state, a_model.state)
end
</code></pre>

<p>The tests work fine, but the method which runs just before the assertion to execute the logic prints various messages to the console, mainly via <code>puts</code>.</p>

<p>Is there a quick, perhaps built-in, way to suppress that output to the console? I am only interested in the final effect of the method on the model object, and for the sake of keeping the console clean basically, I was hoping to find a way to simply prevent all output to the console without re-writing or commenting out those <code>puts</code> statements just for my tests.</p>

<p>It is definitely not a critical issue, but would very much like to hear any thoughts or ideas (or workaround) on it.</p>
","2988","","<p>There's two solutions: redirecting where <code>puts</code> writes to (the solution given by @cldwalker above), or overwriting the <code>puts</code> method itself to be a no-op. (The implementation should be obvious: <code>module Kernel; def puts(*args) end end</code>).</p>

<p>However, in this case, what would <em>really</em> be the best solution is ""listening to your tests"". Because, oftentimes when something is awkward to test, your tests are really trying to tell you that something is wrong with your design. In this case, I smell a violation of the Single Responsibility Principle: why the heck does a Model object need to know how to write to the console? Its responsibility is representing a Domain Concept, not logging! That's what Logger objects are for!</p>

<p>So, an alternative solution would be to have the Model object delegate the responsibility for logging to a Logger object, and use dependency injection to inject the Model object with a suitable Logger object. That way, you can simply inject a <em>fake</em> logger for the test. Here's an example:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env ruby

class SomeModel
  def initialize(logger=Kernel) @logger = logger end
  def some_method_that_logs; @logger.puts 'bla' end
end

require 'test/unit'
require 'stringio'
class TestQuietLogging &lt; Test::Unit::TestCase
  def setup; @old_stdout, $&gt; = $&gt;, (@fake_logdest = StringIO.new) end
  def teardown; $&gt; = @old_stdout end

  def test_that_default_logging_is_still_noisy
    SomeModel.new.some_method_that_logs

    assert_equal ""bla\n"", @fake_logdest.string
  end

  def test_that_logging_can_be_made_quiet
    fake_logger = Object.new
    def fake_logger.puts *args; end

    SomeModel.new(fake_logger).some_method_that_logs

    assert_equal '', @fake_logdest.string
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>At the very least, the Model object should take the <code>IO</code> object that it is logging <em>to</em> as an argument, so that you can simply inject <code>StringIO.new</code> into it for the test:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env ruby

class SomeModel
  def initialize(logdest=$&gt;) @logdest = logdest end
  def some_method_that_logs; @logdest.puts 'bla' end
end

require 'test/unit'
require 'stringio'
class TestQuietLogging &lt; Test::Unit::TestCase
  def setup; @old_stdout, $&gt; = $&gt;, (@fake_logdest = StringIO.new) end
  def teardown; $&gt; = @old_stdout end

  def test_that_default_logging_is_still_noisy
    SomeModel.new.some_method_that_logs

    assert_equal ""bla\n"", @fake_logdest.string
  end

  def test_that_logging_can_be_made_quiet
    fake_logdest = (@fake_logdest = StringIO.new)

    SomeModel.new(fake_logdest).some_method_that_logs

    assert_equal '', @fake_logdest.string
    assert_equal ""bla\n"", fake_logdest.string
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>If you still want to be able to just say <code>puts whatever</code> in your Model or you are afraid that someone might forget to call <code>puts</code> on the logger object, you can provide your own (private) puts method:</p>

<pre><code>class SomeModel
  def initialize(logdest=$&gt;) @logdest = logdest end
  def some_method_that_logs; puts 'bla' end
  private
  def puts(*args) @logdest.puts *args end

"<p>I am currently involved in developing with C# - Here is some background:
We implement MVP with our client application and we have a cyclomatic rule which states that no method should have a cyclomatic complexity greater than 5.
This leads to a lot of small private methods which are generally responsible for one thing.</p>

<p>My question is about unit testing a class:</p>

<p>Testing the private implementation through the public methods is all fine... I don't have a problem implementing this. </p>

<p>But... what about the following cases:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Example 1.</strong> Handle the result of an async data retrival request (The callback method shouldn't be public purely for testing)</p>
  
  <p><strong>Example 2.</strong> An event handler which does an operation (such as update a View label's text - silly example I know...)</p>
  
  <p><strong>Example 3.</strong> You are using a third party framework which allows you to extend by overriding protected virtual methods (the path from the public methods to these virtual methods are generally treated as black box programming and will have all sorts of dependancies that the framework provides that you don't want to know about)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The examples above don't appear to me to be the result of poor design.
They also do not appear be be candidates for moving to a seperate class for testing in isolation as such methods will lose their context.</p>

<p>Doesn anyone have any thoughts about this?</p>

<p>Cheers,
Jason</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>
I don't think I was clear enough in my original question - I can test private methods using accessors and mock out calls/ methods using TypeMock. That isn't the problem. The problem is testing things which don't need to be public, or can't be public. </p>

<p>I don't want to make code public for the sake of testing as it can introduce security loopholes (only publishing an interface to hide this is not an option because anyone can just cast the object back to its original type and get access to stuff I wouldn't want them to) </p>

<p>Code that gets refactored out to another class for testing is fine - but can lose context. I've always thought it bad practice to have 'helper' classes which can contain a pot of code with no specific context - (thinking SRP here). I really don't think this works for event handlers either.</p>

<p>I am happy to be proven wrong - I just am unsure how to test this functionality! I have always been of the mind that if it can break or be changed - test it.</p>

<p>Cheers, Jason</p>
","2988","","<p>There is really only two cases you need to consider:</p>

<ol>
<li>the private code is called, directly or indirectly from public code and</li>
<li>the private code is <em>not</em> called from public code.</li>

<p>In the first case, the private code is automatically being tested by the tests which exercise the public code that calls the private code, so there is no need to test the private code. And in the second case, the private code cannot be called at all, therefore it should be deleted, not tested.</p>

<p>Ergo: there is no need to explicitly test the private code.</p>

<p>Note that when you do TDD it is <em>impossible</em> for untested private code to even exist. Because when you do TDD, the only way that private code can be appear, is by an Extract {Method|Class|...} Refactoring from public code. And Refactorings are, by definition, behavior-preserving and therefore test-coverage-preserving. And the only way that public code can appear is as the result of a failing test. If public code can only appear as already tested code as the result of a failing test, and private code can only appear as the result of being extracted from public code via a behavior-preserving refactoring, it follows that untested private code can never appear.</p>

"<p>Do you know any example of an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric%5Fprogramming%5Flanguage"" rel=""nofollow"">esoteric language</a> used to write any practical-use, real-world program? Is there any, however obscure, domain of computer science where an esoteric language has actually been proven useful for solving a specific problem?</p>
","2988","","<p>There is no practical use for an esoteric programming language, pretty much by definition. However, just because you cannot <em>use</em> them, doesn't mean they aren't <em>useful</em>.</p>

<p>For example, when you look at esoteric programming languages, you can roughly divide them into categories: some are created as a joke, some are created just for fun, some are created as Turing tarpits, but there are also some that are created to prove or illustrate a point. And these <em>are</em> actually useful for exactly that: illustrating a point, maybe in a programming languages class, maybe to the community or to the industry. Even though they are useless for practical purposes, they are use*ful* for educational purposes.</p>

<p>Take non-deterministic esoteric programming languages. These are programming languages for which the evaluation semantics of certain expressions are not defined deterministically, but for example probabilistically or based on the phase of the moon or something like that. If you look at the definition of such a language, you will immediately think: ""Well, that's just stupid."" And it is! (For example, the Hello World program in Java2k is almost a page of code, and it isn't even guaranteed to print ""Hello World"" every time, only most of the time.) And yet, most of today's mainstream programming languages have non-deterministic concurrency models. IOW: as soon as you start a thread in Java, C#, Python, Ruby, Perl, even Erlang or Clojure, your program becomes just as random as in the esoteric language Java2k. So, why do we think one is stupid and accept the other as normal, even though they are essentially the same thing? By taking non-determinism to the extreme, and packaging it up in a fun way, esolangs allow us to ask that question.</p>

<p>Another example is Turing tarpits. A Turing tarpit is an esolang which has almost no features but is still Turing-complete. Such a Turing tarpit can be used to demonstrate two different things: you can use it to demonstrate what exactly it is that makes some languages more ""powerful"" (in the sense of expressive power) than others. If you search around on the web, you will find people ask ""if Lisp is so much better than Java, why don't you show me some program that you can write in Lisp but I cannot write in Java."" And, of course, that's stupid: both languages are Turing-complete, so there is no such program. However, by contrasting Java with, say, Brainfuck, you can show that this is just not meaningful question to ask.</p>

<p>And the other thing you can demonstrate with Turing tarpits is that you can never make a language more powerful (in both senses of the word: computational power and expressive power) by removing features. It sounds obvious, but there are people who actually believe that Microsoft should just remove mutable state from C#, and it would magically become more powerful.</p>

<p>In general, Turing tarpits are good for demonstrating the distinction between the computational power and the expressive power of a programming language.</p>

<p>Other ways in which esolangs can be useful is that they can serve as an inspiration for programming language research. Think of Unlambda, which, as the name implies, is a functional language which is <em>not</em> based on the lambda calculus. In other words: it's a functional language which doesn't have functions.</p>

<p>And last but not least, esolangs can force you to look at a problem from a completely different angle (yes, I admit, it's mostly an awkward angle, but hey, some movie directors (Hitchcock, for example) owe their whole career to looking at things from awkward angles) and they tease your brain like a good puzzle. That is, for example, the whole reason for the existence and the name of Brainfuck.</p>

Maybe the above examples are too simple to actually see why linq is written in one order and sql is written in another.</p>
","2988","","<p>Actually, LINQ's syntax is more closely based on XQuery than it is on SQL, and XQuery does it that way, too.</p>

<p>The main reasons have already been given: in C#, VB.NET and indeed most programming languages, scope flows from top to bottom and left to right, just the way we normally read. The way SQL is written, scope jumps around: an identifier gets already <em>used</em> in the <code>SELECT</code> part of the query, but it only gets introduced later, in the <code>FROM</code> part of the query. That's why the designers of XQuery decided to flip it around and LINQ just follows.</p>

<p>It also matches the mental model better: you have list of data sources (<code>FROM</code>), then you filter out the data you're interested in (<code>WHERE</code>), then you sort this data (<code>ORDERBY</code>) and lastly you either project it into a different representation (<code>SELECT</code>) or partition the results (<code>GROUP BY</code>). After that, you can inject the results into the next query (<code>INTO</code>).</p>

"<p>Clojure is a functional lisp, reportedly not at all object-oriented, even though it runs on the JVM, a VM designed for an object oriented language.  Clojure provides identical interfaces for iterating over lists and vectors by abstracting them to an interface called seq.  This is even implemented internally using a Java interface called ISeq.  Is this not an example of object-oriented abstraction?  How can it be claimed that Clojure is not object-oriented?</p>

<p>Polymorphism has absolutely no relation to object-orientation. It simply means that the same operation can behave differently depending on the type(s) of its operands.</p>

<p>Functional languages like ML or Haskell have had polymorphism for more than 30 years, and someone with a better knowledge of PL history can probably point out some examples pre-1962 (i.e. pre-OO).</p>

<p>Christopher Strachey described the distinction between parametric polymorphism and ad-hoc polymorphism in 1967, so polymorphism must have <em>already</em> existed then. Since polymorphism was only introduced in OO in Simula-67, my guess is that polymorphism <em>must</em> have existed before it was introduced in OO.</p>

"<p>Pardon the total newbiew question but why is @game_score always nil?</p>

<pre><code>#bowling.rb

class Bowling
  @game_score = 0
    def hit(pins)
    	@game_score = @game_score + pins
    end

    def score
    	@game_score
    end
end
</code></pre>
","2988","","<p>Let's walk through the code, shall we?</p>

<pre><code>#bowling.rb

class Bowling
  @game_score = 0 # (1)
</code></pre>

<p>At this point (1), we are still inside the <em>class</em> <code>Bowling</code>. Remember: classes are just objects like any other. So, at this point you are assigning <code>0</code> to the instance variable <code>@game_score</code> <em>of the class object <code>Bowling</code></em>.</p>

<pre><code> def hit(pins)
  @game_score = @game_score + pins # (2)
</code></pre>

<p>Now (2), we are inside an <em>instance method</em> of the <code>Bowling</code> class. I.e.: this is a method that is going to belong to an <em>instance</em> of <code>Bowling</code>. So, now the instance variable <code>@game_score</code> belongs to an <em>instance</em> of the <code>Bowling</code> class, and not to the class itself.</p>

<p>Since <em>this</em> instance variable is never initialized to anything, it will evaluate to <code>nil</code> (in Ruby, uninitialized variables always evaluate to <code>nil</code>), so this evaluates to <code>@game_score = nil + pins</code> and since <code>nil</code> doesn't have a <code>#+</code> method, this will result in a <code>NoMethodError</code> exception being raised.</p>

<pre><code> end
 def score
  @game_score # (3)
</code></pre>

<p>And here (3), we are again inside an <em>instance method</em> of the <code>Bowling</code> class. This will always evaluate to <code>nil</code>, for the reason I outlined above: <code>@game_score</code> is never initialized, therefore it evaluates to <code>nil</code>.</p>

<pre><code> end
end
</code></pre>

<p>We can use Ruby's reflection capabilities to take a look at what's going on:</p>

<pre><code>p Bowling.instance_variable_get(:@game_score) # =&gt; 0
b = Bowling.new
p b.instance_variable_get(:@game_score) # =&gt; nil
</code></pre>

<p>Now let's inject a value into the instance variable:</p>

<pre><code>b.instance_variable_set(:@game_score, 1)
p b.score # =&gt; 1
b.hit(3)
p b.score # =&gt; 4
</code></pre>

<p>So, we see that everything works as it should, we only need to figure out how to make sure the instance variable gets initialized.</p>

<p>To do that, we need to write an initializer method. Strangely, the initializer method is actually a private <em>instance method</em> called <code>initialize</code>. (The reason why <code>initialize</code> is an instance method and not a class method, is actually quite simple. Ruby splits object creation in two phases: memory allocation and object initialization. Memory allocation is done by a <em>class</em> method called <code>alloc</code> and object initialization is done by an <em>instance</em> method called <code>initialize</code>. (Objective-C programmers will recognize this.) The reason why <code>alloc</code> is a class method is simply that at this point in the execution there is no instance yet. And the reason that <code>initialize</code> is an instance method is that object initialization is obviously per-object. As a convenience, there is a standard factory class method called <code>new</code> that calls both <code>alloc</code> and <code>initialize</code> for you.)</p>

<pre><code>class Bowling
 def initialize
  @game_score = 0
 end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Let's test this:</p>

<pre><code>c = Bowling.new
p c.score # =&gt; 0
c.hit(2)
p c.score # =&gt; 2
</code></pre>

<p>BTW: just some minor Ruby style tips: indentation is 2 spaces, not 1 tab. And your <code>hit</code> method would more idiomatically be <code>@game_score += pins</code>.</p>

","2988","","<p>Unfortunately, while the Java <em>community</em> seems to be very enthusiastic about polyglot programming, the IDE vendors haven't really kept up. They generally <em>do</em> have plugins for Java, Scala, Clojure, Groovy, Ruby, ECMAScript, Python, C++ projects, but <em>mixing</em> multiple languages in <em>one</em> project is generally not supported.</p>

<p>In Ruby, for example, it is quite common to use Swing as a GUI via JRuby. But if you want to use Matisse, the NetBeans Swing GUI builder you must use a Java project, you cannot use Matisse in a Ruby project. However, if you use a Java project, then you can't have a Ruby main executable, you must have a Java main executable. Also, you don't get Rake support and other things that the Ruby project type supports. (The ugly workaround is to write a Java main executable which creates a <code>JRubyEngine</code> instance by hand, loads the <em>Ruby</em> main executable into it and runs it.)</p>

<p>The Eclipse Scala plugin supports a limited amount of polyglotism, but the hoops that they have to jump through are tremendous.

The Groovy plugin does similar things, as does AspectJ (in fact, they originally came up with the idea of using aspect weaving to inject new functionality into JDT). So, all of these plugins allow polyglot programming with themselves and Java. But unfortunately not with each other.

"<p>Last week I successfully completed the transition of all our company applications from Ruby 1.8.6 to Ruby 1.8.7 including local and remote configurations.
From now on, development won't need to ensure backward-compatibility with Ruby 1.8.6.</p>

<p>For the sake of curiosity, I tried to run the test suite of a couple of projects against Ruby 1.9.1. As expected, I found some encoding-related issue but I was really shocked when I discovered low-level incompatibilities such as a Rack::Link known bug.
At this point, the idea of moving development to Ruby 1.9.1 is simply not applicable.</p>

(At least since May, I think.)</p>

<p>And the best part is of course that it is not only Open Source but a truly Open Project with open mailinglist, open bugtracker and open <a href=""http://Gitorious.Org/Gitorious/"">repository</a>, so that you can see <em>exactly</em> how they did it and how much work it was.</p>

"<p>I am looking for a binary diff tool which allows me to mask parts of the binary files so they won't be taken into account.</p>

<p>The challenge I am facing is the following: Once we finished actively developing a branch of our embedded software we put it into maintenance. This means it is still build once a week to ensure that it doesn't erode and is not buildable any more. This is necessary so that once we urgently need to fix a bug or add a little feature we can concentrate on this and not need to solve other problems as well.</p>

<p>With our current approach we know that the branch still builds without errors but we do not know whether the produced binaries are is still the same. So I thought comparing a “golden master”  binary against what was build and decide whether they are identical would be an approach to this. Anyhow, the files will never be identical to the bit because e.g. build dates are part of the binaries.</p>

<p>Does anyone have an idea or has even solved this puzzle before? I guess I am not the first developer facing this challenge.</p>

"<p>Our C++ application reads configuration data from XML files that look something like this: </p>

<pre><code>&lt;data&gt;
 &lt;value id=""FOO1"" name=""foo1"" size=""10"" description=""the foo"" ... /&gt;
 &lt;value id=""FOO2"" name=""foo2"" size=""10"" description=""the other foo"" ... /&gt;
 ...
 &lt;value id=""FOO300"" name=""foo300"" size=""10"" description=""the last foo"" ... /&gt;
&lt;/data&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The complete application configuration consist of ~2500 of these XML files (which translates into more than 1.5 million key/value attribute pairs).  The XML files come from many different sources/teams and are validated against a schema.  However, sometimes the <code>&lt;value/&gt;</code> nodes look like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;value name=""bar1"" id=""BAR1"" description=""the bar"" size=""20"" ... /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>or this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;value id=""BAT1"" description=""the bat"" name=""bat1""  size=""25"" ... /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>To make this process fast, we are using <a href=""http://expat.sourceforge.net/"">Expat</a> to parse the XML documents.  Expat exposes the attributes as an array - like this:</p>

<pre><code>void ExpatParser::StartElement(const XML_Char* name, const XML_Char** atts)
{
 // The attributes are stored in an array of XML_Char* where:
 //  the nth element is the 'key'
 //  the n+1 element is the value
 //  the final element is NULL
 for (int i = 0; atts[i]; i += 2) 
 {
  std::string key = atts[i];
  std::string value = atts[i + 1];
  ProcessAttribute (key, value);
 }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This puts all the responsibility onto our <code>ProcessAttribute()</code> function to read the 'key' and decide what to do with the value.  <strong>Profiling the app has shown that ~40% of the total XML Parsing time is dealing with these attributes by name/string.</strong> </p>

<p>The overall process could be sped up dramatically if I could guarantee/enforce the order of the attributes (for starters, no string comparisons in <code>ProcessAttribute()</code>).  For example, if 'id' attribute was <em>always</em> the 1st attribute we could deal with it directly:</p>

<pre><code>void ExpatParser::StartElement(const XML_Char* name, const XML_Char** atts)
{
 // The attributes are stored in an array of XML_Char* where:
 //  the nth element is the 'key'
 //  the n+1 element is the value
 //  the final element is NULL
 ProcessID (atts[1]);
 ProcessName (atts[3]);
 //etc.
}
</code></pre>

<p>According to the W3C schema specs, I can use <code>&lt;xs:sequence&gt;</code> in an XML schema to enforce the order of elements - but it doesn't seem to work for attributes - or perhaps I'm using it incorrectly:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;xs:element name=""data""&gt;
 &lt;xs:complexType&gt;
  &lt;xs:sequence&gt;
   &lt;xs:element name=""value"" type=""value_type"" minOccurs=""1"" maxOccurs=""unbounded"" /&gt;
  &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;
 &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;
&lt;/xs:element&gt;

&lt;xs:complexType name=""value_type""&gt;
 &lt;!-- This doesn't work --&gt;
 &lt;xs:sequence&gt;
  &lt;xs:attribute name=""id"" type=""xs:string"" /&gt;
  &lt;xs:attribute name=""name"" type=""xs:string"" /&gt;
  &lt;xs:attribute name=""description"" type=""xs:string"" /&gt;
 &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;
&lt;/xs:complexType&gt;

<p>So, if you clone a Fossil repository, you do not just get the latest version of the source code plus all its history, like you would get with Git, Mercurial, Bazaar, Monotone, Darcs or any other version control system, you <em>also</em> get the current bug database plus all its history and the current wiki plus all its history.</p>

<p>Fossil is written by D. Richard Hipp, who is not only the author of SQLite but also CVSTrac (the precursor of Trac). So, you <em>know</em> it's gotta be good.</p>

<p>If you want to see an example of Fossil in action, just the follow the link I posted: Fossil is hosted in Fossil itself and the Fossil homepage is actually just the Fossil repository itself.</p>

<p>BTW: even if you don't end up using Fossil, just spend some time learning its concepts. It's a rather brilliant design, and you're probably going to learn something which you can apply even if you are using Trac, Git, Instiki or whatever.</p>

"<p>I <a href=""http://github.com/softcraft-development/sprint/blob/master/lib/sprint.rb"" rel=""nofollow"">have a class</a> which exposes a string value and an int value (a command output and exit code respectively). In addition to exposing them through <code>to_s</code> and <code>to_i</code>, I'm also using <code>to_str</code> and <code>to_int</code>, like so:</p>

<pre><code>class Status
  def to_s
    @output
  end
  alias :to_str :to_s

  def to_i
    @status.exitstatus
  end
  alias :to_int :to_i
end
</code></pre>

<p>My idea behind this is to be able to use this object in as many situations as possible. having it coerceable to a string or int increases that usability. For instance, I can concatenate the object with a string:</p>

<pre><code>a_string = ""Output was: "" + results
</code></pre>

<p>(I wanted to use this as an example of int coercion, but Fixnum.+ doesn't like it, so it doesn't actually work:)</p>

<pre><code>an_int = 1 + results
</code></pre>

<p>Everything I've read so far has said that this is probably a ""bad"" thing to do. The common theme goes like this: ""Use <code>to_s</code>/<code>to_i</code> when your object can be represented as a string/int, but <code>to_str</code>/<code>to_int</code> only if your object <em>is fundamentally</em> a string/int"".</p>

<p>There's no question that my class is not ""fundamentally"" a string or an int. However
I have some problems with this rule:</p>

<ol>
<li>It makes my class less flexible/usable. For example: I couldn't use String.+ to concatenate the Status output with the other string if I didn't have Status.to_str.</li>
<li>It seems to violate the spirit of duck-typing. The user of an object (ie: a method that gets it as a parameter) shouldn't care what that object <em>is</em>, it should only care what it can <em>do</em>. (In this case, ""do"" means ""can be represented as a string/int"".)</li>
<li>The arguments for ""is fundamentally a string/int"" are pretty fuzzy to me. For example, you'll see that <code>Float.to_int</code> is mentioned a lot. The story goes that since a floating-point number always has an integer component, <code>to_int</code> is a valid method. However, I think this is spurious: a Float is <em>not</em> an integer (as it has a non-integer component) and so trying to equate their ""typeness"" doesn't make much sense. You can legitimately <em>convert</em> a Float to an integer (through truncation), but then I can say that I can <em>convert</em> my Status to an integer as well (by ""truncating"" all of the non-exit-code information).</li>
</ol>

<p>So, my question is: <em>is there any real (ie: practical) harm</em> in implementing <code>to_str</code> and <code>to_int</code>?</p>

<p><hr></p>

<p>Update: Jörg W Mittag gave an example that made me thing of something. To rephrase the question: is there really a need to have <code>to_str</code>/<code>to_int</code> when you already have <code>to_s</code>/<code>to_i</code>? (Besides the fact that particular methods are already expecting <code>to_str</code> over <code>to_s</code>)</p>

<p>For instance, in Jörg's Array.join example, the array members are converted via to_s while the separator is converted via to_str. But is this really necessary? If Array.join called separator.to_s instead, then you could successfully pass many more objects to it (ex: Integers, Symbols, etc) and gain that much more flexibility. Does Ruby benefit from having this separation?</p>
","2988","","<blockquote>
  <p>It makes my class less flexible/usable. For example: I couldn't use <code>String#+</code> to concatenate the Status output with the other string if I didn't have <code>Status#to_str</code>.</p>

<p>This is a bad example, because concatenating strings is unidiomatic Ruby. String interpolation is the preferred way:</p>

<pre><code>a_string = ""Output was: #{results}""
</code></pre>

<p>And this <em>just works</em>&trade;, because string interpolation actually calls <code>to_s</code> on the result of the interpolated expression.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I would argue that ""can be represented as a string/int"" isn't really behavior. IOW: ""what the object can do"" is about interesting behavior in a certain context, and ""can be represented as a string/int"" isn't really interesting behavior.</p>

<p>If you say that ""Status IS-A Integer"" (which is essentially what <code>to_int</code> means), then it follows that you can, for example, do arithmetic with it. But what does it even <em>mean</em> to ""add 42 to <em>file not found</em>""? What is the logarithm of success? What is the square root of failure?</p>

<p>In the above string interpolation example, the interesting behavior is ""can be displayed"". And that is basically indicated by implementing <code>#to_s</code>. Concatenating two strings, OTOH, requires, well, two strings.</p>

You can legitimately <em>convert</em> a Float to an integer (through truncation), but then I can say that I can <em>convert</em> my Status to an integer as well (by ""truncating"" all of the non-exit-code information).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, this is a rather weak argument, because I actually agree with you: that's wrong.</p>

<p>In German Law, we have a principle which is hard to grasp and un-inituitive, but which I think applies here perfectly. It is called ""Keine Gleichheit im Unrecht"" (No Equality in Wrongness). It means that the basic right of Equaliy, which is granted in the Constitution, only applies <em>within</em> the Law. To put it another way: OJ doesn't make murder legal.</p>

<p>So, just because there is crap code in the Ruby core library (and believe me, there is a <em>lot</em>), doesn't mean you get to write crap, too :-)</p>

<p>In this particular case, <code>Float#to_int</code> is just plain wrong and shouldn't exist. <code>Float</code> <em>is not</em> a subtype of <code>Integer</code>. At first glance, the opposite seems to be true, i.e. <code>Integer#to_float</code> is valid, but actually that's not true, either: in Ruby, <code>Integer</code>s have arbitrary precision, but <code>Float</code>s have fixed precision. It <em>would</em> be valid to implement <code>Fixnum#to_float</code>, but that would be a bad idea, since <code>Integer</code>s can magically convert from <code>Fixnum</code> to <code>BigInteger</code> and back, and thus the <code>#to_float</code> method would ""magically"" appear and vanish.</p>

<p>The thing that finally helped <em>me</em> understand the difference between <code>to_x</code> and <code>to_xyz</code> was <code>Array#join</code>: it prints out the elements of the array, separated by a separator object. It does this by calling <code>to_s</code> on each element of the array and <code>to_str</code> on the separator. Once you understand <em>why</em> it calls <code>to_s</code> on one and <code>to_str</code> on the other, you're basically set.</p>

<p>(Although your comments on <code>Float#to_int</code> already indicate that you <em>do</em> understand.)</p>

<hr>

<p>Side note: for double dispatch in an algebraic context, Ruby actually uses the <code>#coerce</code> protocol. So, if you wanted the <code>1 + a_status</code> example to work, you would need to implement <code>Status#coerce</code>. But, please don't.</p>

"<p>Apparently, when you move a function from one source code file to another, the git revision log (for the new file) can show you where that code fragment was originally coming from (see for example the Viewing History section in <a href=""http://nathanj.github.com/gitguide/tour.html"">this tutorial</a>).</p>

<p>How does this work?</p>
","2988","","<p>It doesn't track them. That's the beauty of it.</p>

<p>Git only records snapshots of the entire project tree: here's what <em>all files</em> looked like before the commit and here's how they look like after. <em>How</em> we got from here to there, Git doesn't care.</p>

<p>This allows intelligent tools to be written <em>after</em> a commit has already happened, to extract information from that commit. For example, rename detection in Git is done by comparing all deleted files against all new files and comparing pairwise similarity metrics. If the similarity metric is greater than <code>x</code>, they are considered renamed, if it is between <code>y</code> and <code>x</code> (<code>y &lt; x</code>), it is considered to be a rename+edit, and if it is below <code>y</code>, they are considered independent. The cool thing is that you, as a ""commit archaeologist"", can specify after the fact, what <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> should be. This would not work if the commit simply recorded ""this file is a rename of that file"".</p>

<p>Detecting moved content works similar: you slice every file into pieces, compute similarity metrics between all the slices and can then deduce that this slice which was deleted over here and this very similar slice which was added over there are actually the same slice that was moved from here to there.</p>

<p>However, as tonfa mentioned in his answer, this is <em>very</em> expensive, so it is not normally done. But it <em>could</em> be done, and that's the point.</p>

"<p>I am quite new to ruby but enjoying it so far quite immensely.  There are some things that have given me some trouble and the following is no exception.</p>

<p>What I am trying to do here is create a sort of 'super-directory' by sub-classing 'Dir'.  I've added a method called 'subdirs' that is designed to list the directory object's files and push them into an array if the file is a directory itself.  The issue is, the results from my test (File.directory?) is strange - here is my method code:</p>

<pre><code>  def subdirs
    subdirs = Array.new
    self.each do |x|
      puts ""Evaluating file: #{x}""
      if File.directory?(x)
        puts ""This file (#{x}) was considered a directory by File.directory?""

</code></pre>
","2988","","<p>Mark Westling has already answered your immediate question, but since you mention you are new to Ruby, here are a couple of other style suggestions:</p>

<pre><code>def subdirs
  subdirs = Array.new
</code></pre>

<p>It is generally preferred to use literal syntax where possible, so the common way to express this would be <code>subdirs = []</code>.</p>

<pre><code>  self.each do |x|
</code></pre>

<p><code>self</code> is the implicit receiver in Ruby, so you can just leave it off. (This is not Python, after all.) However, the primary purpose of code is communication, so if you believe, this communicates your intent better, leave it in.</p>

<p>Speaking of communication: <code>x</code> is not a terribly communicative name, unless you are talking about points in a cartesian coordinate system. How about <code>file</code>, or if you are uncomfortable with the Unix notion that directories are also files, the more neutral <code>entry</code>? (Actually, the best one would probably be <code>path</code>, but we will see soon how that might become confusing.)</p>

<p>My third suggestion is actually personal preference that is contrary to common Ruby style: common Ruby style dictates that one-line blocks are delimited with <code>{</code>/<code>}</code> and multiline blocks are delimited with <code>do</code>/<code>end</code>, just like you did. I don't like that, because it is an arbitrary distinction that doesn't convey any <em>meaning</em>. (Remember that ""communication"" thing?) So, I actually do things differently: if the block is imperative in nature and, for example, changes some global state, I use the keywords (because the block is actually <code>do</code>ing some work) and if the block is functional in nature and just returns a new object, I prefer to use braces (because they look nicely mathematical). So, in this case, I would use braces.</p>

<pre><code>    if File.directory?(x)
</code></pre>

<p>As Mark already explained, you need to do something like <code>File.directory?(File.join(path, entry))</code> here, where <code>Dir#path</code> is a public attribute of the <code>Dir</code> class returning the path that <code>Dir.new</code> was initialized with.</p>

<p>Here you also see, why we didn't use <code>path</code> as the name of the block parameter. Otherwise we would need to write <code>File.directory?(File.join(self.path, path))</code>.</p>

<pre><code>      subdirs.push(x)
</code></pre>

<p>The canonical way to append an element to an array, or indeed append pretty much anything to anything in Ruby, is the <code>&lt;&lt;</code> operator. So, this should read <code>subdirs &lt;&lt; entry</code>.</p>

<p><code>Array#push</code> is an alias of <code>Array#&lt;&lt;</code>, which is mainly intended to let you use an <code>Array</code> as a stack (in conjunction with <code>Array#pop</code>).</p>

<pre><code>    end
  end
  return subdirs
</code></pre>

<p>Here is another disconnect between my personal style and common Ruby style: in Ruby, if there is no explicit <code>return</code>, the return value is simply the value of the last expression. This means, you can leave off the <code>return</code> keyword and common Ruby style says you should. I, however, prefer to use this similar to the block delimiters: use <code>return</code> for methods that are functional in nature (because they actually ""return"" a value) and no <code>return</code> for imperative methods (because their <em>real</em> return value is not what comes after the <code>return</code> keyword, but what side-effects they have on the environment). So, like you, I would use a <code>return</code> keyword here, despite common style.</p>

<p>It is also customary, to seperate the return value from the rest of the method body by a blank line. (The same goes for setup code, by the way.)</p>

<pre><code>end
</code></pre>

<p>So, this is where we stand right now:</p>

<pre><code>def subdirs
  subdirs = []

  each { |entry|
    if File.directory?(File.join(path, entry))
      subdirs &lt;&lt; entry
    end
  }

  return subdirs
end
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, the <code>if</code> expression really only serves to skip one iteration of the loop. This is much better communicated by using the <code>next</code> keyword:</p>

<pre><code>def subdirs
  subdirs = []

  each { |entry|
    next  unless File.directory?(File.join(path, entry))
    subdirs &lt;&lt; entry
  }

  return subdirs
end
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, we managed to remove one level of nesting from the block structure, which is always a good sign.</p>

<p>This idiom is called a ""guard clause"", and is quite popular in functional programming, where a lot of languages even have guard constructs built in, but it is also used heavily in pretty much any other language on the planet, because it greatly simplifies control flow: the idea is analogous to a guard posted outside a castle: instead of letting the bad guys into the castle (method, procedure, function, block, ...) and then painfully trying to track their every move and constantly being afraid to miss something or lose them, you simply post a guard at the <em>entrance</em> of your castle (the beginning of your method, block, ...) who doesn't let them in to begin with (which jumps to the end of the procedure, returns early from the method, skips one iteration of the loop, ...). In Ruby, you can use <code>raise</code>, <code>return</code>, <code>next</code> and <code>break</code> for this. In other languages, even <code>GOTO</code> is fine (this is one of those rare cases, where a <code>GOTO</code> can actually <em>clear up</em> control flow).</p>

<p>However, we can simplify this even further, by recognizing the iterator pattern: you take a list (the directory entries) and then you ""squash"" that list down to a single object (the <code>subdirs</code> array). To a category theorist, this screams ""catamorphism"", to a hardcore functional programmer ""<code>fold</code>"", to a softcore functional programmer ""<code>reduce</code>"", to a Smalltalk programmer ""<code>inject:into:</code>"" and to a Rubyist ""<code>Enumerable#inject</code>"":</p>

<pre><code>def subdirs
  return inject([]) { |subdirs, entry|
    next subdirs  unless File.directory?(File.join(path, entry))
    subdirs &lt;&lt; entry
  }
end
</code></pre>

<p><code>inject</code> uses the return value of the previous iteration to seed the next one, that's why we have to return <code>subdirs</code>, even if we are skipping an iteration, by using <code>next subdirs</code> instead of plain <code>next</code> (which would return <code>nil</code>, so that on the next iteration <code>subdirs</code> would be <code>nil</code> and <code>subdirs &lt;&lt; entry</code> would raise a <code>NoMethodError</code>.)</p>

<p>(Notice that I used curly braces for the block, even though the block actually modifies its argument. I feel this is still a ""functional"" block, though. YMMV.)</p>

<p>The last thing we can do is to recognize that what we are doing is just filtering (or in other words ""selecting"") elements of an array. And Ruby already has a method built in, which does exactly that: <code>Enumerable#select</code>. Witness the single-line awesomeness that using the full power of Ruby generates:</p>

<pre><code>def subdirs
  return select { |entry| File.directory?(File.join(path, entry)) }
end
</code></pre>

<p>As a general tip: learn the wonders of <code>Enumerable</code>. It is <em>the</em> workhorse of Ruby programming, similar to <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code> in .NET, <code>dict</code>s in Python, lists in functional languages or associative arrays in PHP and Perl.</p>

"<p>I am currently working on a project using svn (server is version 1.4 which means no modern merge tools available). </p>

"<p>Consider the following code:</p>

<pre><code>module ModName

<p>If we replace <code>module</code> with <code>class</code>, we can do the following:</p>

<p>Modules cannot be instanced, though. Is there a way to call the <code>aux</code> method on the module?</p>
","2988","","<blockquote>
  <p>the module definition evaluates to 'this is...', why?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In Ruby, everything is an expression, there are no statements or declarations. Which means that everyhing evaluates to a value. (However, this doesn't necessarily mean that it evaluates to a <em>useful</em> value. For example, the <code>puts</code> method always evaluates to <code>nil</code>, just like a <code>def</code> method definition expression (except in Rubinius, where the <code>def</code> expression evaluates to a <code>CompiledMethod</code> object for the method being defined).)</p>

<p>So, if everything evaluates to a value, what should a module definition expression evaluate to? Well, there are a couple of candidates: it could evaluate to <code>nil</code>, just like a method definition expression. Or it could evaluate to the module object itself, after all, this <em>is</em> what we are defining, right? But actually, Matz chose a third option: module (and class) definition expressions actually evaluate to whatever the last expression inside the module definition body evaluates to. (This allows you to easily simulate the other two possibilities by just putting <code>nil</code> or <code>self</code> as the last expression inside a module definition body.)</p>

<p>In your case, the last expression inside the module definition body is an assignment. But, an assignment? What the heck does <em>that</em> return? Isn't that a statement? No, not in Ruby. <em>Everything</em> is an expression, and assignments are no exception: assignment expressions evaluate to whatever the right hand side evaluates to. Here, the right hand side of the assignment expression is a string literal, which evaluates to a string object.</p>

<p>So, the entire module definition expression evaluates to the string <code>'this is a const in module'</code>.</p>

</ul>

<p>I think I also remember someone working on embedding V8 with MRI, but I can't find the reference right now.</p>

<p>The main problem with Johnson is that MRI is an incredibly crappy language implementation that leaks memory left and right, and the only language implementation in the world that could possibly be even more crappy is SpiderMonkey. Thus, the TODO list in the Johnson Git repository doesn't exactly inspire confidence; it only contains one item, and I quote literally:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Stop freaking segfaulting.</p>

<p>Lyndon is built on a much better foundation, but it obviously requires running OSX on the server. Plus, MacRuby hasn't been released yet.</p>

<p>I think JRuby+Rhino is probably the most stable option, although you will have to build the integration yourself: they are just two independent language implementations that happen to live on the same VM, but there is no integration between them.</p>

<p>As an alternative you could try to approach the problem from a different direction: instead of keeping your application logic in JavaScript and running that both on the client and the server, you could keep your application logic in Ruby and run that on the server and the client: there are a couple of compilers out there that can compile (a subset of) Ruby to JavaScript. On of them is <a href=""https://RubyForge.Org/projects/rubyjs/"" rel=""nofollow"">RubyJS</a>.

","2988","","<p>A couple of things come to mind. You do not specify what Ruby implementation you are using. Since you run Ruby 1.8.6 on Windows, I am going to assume that you are using MRI installed via the Windows One-Click Installer.</p>

<p>This is kind of a worst-case scenario:</p>

<ol>
<li>MRI is the slowest of all the Ruby implementations</li>
<li>MRI on Windows is <em>even slower</em> than MRI on Linux or OSX</li>
<li>The One-Click Installer uses the pre-compiled binaries from Ruby-Lang.Org, which are compiled with Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 from 1996, and thus are <em>even slower</em> than MRI on Windows compiled with Microsoft Visual C++ 10.0 or GCC 4.x or even GCC 3.x.</li>
</ol>

<p>Here's a couple of tips that you could try to improve performance:</p>

<ul>
<li>use the <a href=""http://RubyInstaller.Org/"" rel=""nofollow"">RubyInstaller</a> project, which uses interpreters compiled with GCC 3.x instead of MSVC6, </li>
<li>maybe recompile the interpreter yourself (it's not that hard with the Rakefiles provided by the <a href=""https://GitHub.Com/OneClick/RubyInstaller/"" rel=""nofollow"">RubyInstaller</a> project) with GCC 4.x and/or different optimization options (RubyInstaller is compiled with moderate optimization options and for generic 386 CPUs), </li>
<li>use a newer version of MRI than 1.8.6, </li>
<li><p>use a different implementation of Ruby: </p>

<ul>
<li>YARV is significantly faster than MRI (unfortunately, it only implements Ruby 1.9, so you might have to change your code), </li>
<li><a href=""http://JRuby.Org/"" rel=""nofollow"">JRuby</a> is significantly faster than YARV in a lot of scenarios, and it implements both Ruby 1.8 and Ruby 1.9 (it also has a <code>-fast</code> commandline option, which is slightly incompatible with Ruby, but improves performance, including arithmetic performance) and </li>
<li><a href=""http://IronRuby.Net/"" rel=""nofollow"">IronRuby</a> might also be faster than YARV, depending on the workload.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>In the latter two cases you might want to revise your benchmarks a bit. Both eventually can compile Ruby code to native machine code, but it might take a while. JRuby for example compiles to JVM bytecode after a method has been executed 20 times and HotSpot Server compiles JVM bytecode to native machine code after it has executed 20000 times. Also, compilation itself takes time, so the program needs to run a while to gain back that cost through improved performance.</p>

<p>In particular, Charles Oliver Nutter, one of the JRuby lead developers, said that depending on the workload, JRuby might take up to 5-15 seconds to ramp up to full speed. Your benchmarks are about 100x too fast (here's a sentence you don't hear every day ...).</p>

"<p>I am just curious if there is a programming language which has state machines (similar to boost::statechart) as primary language construct.</p>

<p>Analogies - c# has delegates  where java uses the observer pattern and C has callbacks. Perl and python have built-in hashes while C++ and java needs a library.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>This should be general programming language in the sense of C++, C#, Java, Lisp ...</p>

<p>I mean ""mature"" state machines with all bells and whistles on the level of Harel formalism or UML state diagrams or boost::statechart.</p>
","2988","","<p><a href=""http://CompLang.Org/ragel/"">Ragel</a> is a state machine language. IOW, it's not a language that <em>also</em> supports state machines, it's a language that <em>only</em> supports state machines. Which obviously means that it's not Turing-complete, but who needs that?</p>

<p>More precisely, Ragel is a state machine compiler, which takes a description of a state machine in a regexp-like language and generates an implementation of that state machine in C, C++, Objective-C, D, Java or Ruby. (Think <code>yacc</code> but for state machines instead of LALR(1) table parsers.) The primary purpose of Ragel is parsing binary protocols (such as networking protocols or also on-disk file formats), but it can just as well be used for text.</p>

<p>One famous example of using Ragel is the Mongrel webserver for Ruby: its HTTP kernel is written in Ragel, which makes it <em>extremely</em> fast and secure. The HTTP kernel is so good in fact, that it has been reused a number of times in different applications: Thin, Unicorn and Rainbows are also webservers, and in fact direct competitors to Mongrel. Ebb is a reverse HTTP proxy. RFuzz is a fuzz testing tool for web applications. Also, some security tools use it.</p>

<p>Ragel also allows embedding code in the host language into the state machine, thus making it Turing-complete, and able to not only <em>recognize</em> but also <em>interpret</em> protocols.</p>

<p>In general, <em>every</em> language with support for advanced user-defined control-flow via either coroutines (e.g. Lua) or continuations (e.g. Scala) or <code>GOTO</code> (e.g. PHP) or proper tail calls (e.g. Scheme) can be used to easily <em>implement</em> state machines. (Generators (Python) aka iterators (C#), which are basically ""crappy coroutines"" might or might not work, depending on your definition of ""work"".) And any language which has flexible syntax (e.g. Ruby) or supports metasyntactic abstraction (e.g. Clojure) can be used to <em>describe</em> state machines. (Support for non-ASCII identifiers helps, too, so that you can use actual arrows for your state machine.)</p>

<p>Which means that if you <em>combine</em> the two, and use a language that supports <em>both</em> tail calls <em>and</em> metasyntactic abstraction, you get very nice state machines, <em>without</em> requiring native language support. Shriram Krishnamurthi gave a now (in)famous talk titled ""The Swine before Perl"" at the inaugural Lightweight Languages Conference, in which he demonstrated an FSM implementation in Scheme. (Here are the <a href=""http://www.ai.mit.edu/projects/dynlangs/ll1/shriram-talk.ppt"">slides</a>, an <a href=""http://www.cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Talks/SwineBeforePerl/audio.mp3"">audio recording</a> and a <a href=""http://www.cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/sk-automata-macros/"">paper explaining the code</a>). The code itself is a 26 line (very short lines, actually) macro, that allows you to write code like this:</p>

<pre><code>(define my-regex
  (automaton init
             [init : (c → more)]
             [more : (a → more)
                     (d → more)
                     (r → end)]
             [end : accept]))
</code></pre>

<p>This is a specification of the state machine corresponding to the regular expression <code>c(a|d)*r</code>. And it is not only a specification, but also a runnable program <em>implementing</em> that state machine.</p>

<p>I can call it like this:</p>

<pre><code>(my-regex '(c a d a d d r))
</code></pre>

<p>And in this case get the result <code>#t</code> (which is Scheme-speak for <code>true</code>).</p>

","2988","","<p>There have already been several good answers to your immediate problem, but I have noticed some other pieces of your code that warrant a comment. (Most of them trivial, though.)</p>

<p>Here's four trivial ones, all of them related to coding style:</p>

<ol>
<li>Indentation: you are mixing 4 spaces for indentation and 5 spaces. It is generally better to stick to just <em>one</em> style of indentation, and in Ruby that is generally 2 spaces.</li>
<li>If a method doesn't take any parameters, it is customary to leave off the parantheses in the method definition.</li>
<li>Likewise, if you send a message without arguments, the parantheses are left off.</li>
<li>No whitespace after an opening paranthesis and before a closing one, except in blocks.</li>
</ol>

<p>Anyway, that's just the small stuff. The big stuff is this:</p>

<pre><code>def new
  @a = 1
end
</code></pre>

<p>This does <em>not</em> do what you think it does! This defines an <em>instance</em> method called <code>X#new</code> and <em>not</em> a class method called <code>X.new</code>!</p>

<p>What you are calling here:</p>

<pre><code>x = X.new
</code></pre>

<p>is a <em>class</em> method called <code>new</code>, which you have inherited from the <code>Class</code> class. So, you never call your new method, which means  <code>@a = 1</code> never gets executed, which means <code>@a</code> is always undefined, which means it will always evaluate to <code>nil</code> which means the <code>@a</code> of <code>self</code> and the <code>@a</code> of <code>other</code> will always be the same which means <code>m</code> will always be <code>true</code>!</p>

<p>What you probably want to do is provide a constructor, except Ruby doesn't <em>have</em> constructors. Ruby only uses factory methods.</p>

<p>The method you <em>really</em> wanted to override is the <em>instance</em> method <code>initialize</code>. Now you are probably asking yourself: ""why do I have to override an <em>instance</em> method called <code>initialize</code> when I'm actually calling a <em>class</em> method called <code>new</code>?""</p>

<p>Well, object construction in Ruby works like this: object construction is split into two phases, <em>allocation</em> and <em>initialization</em>. Allocation is done by a public class method called <code>allocate</code>, which is defined as an instance method of class <code>Class</code> and is generally <em>never</em> overriden. It just allocates the memory space for the object and sets up a few pointers, however, the object is not really usable at this point.</p>

<p>That's where the initializer comes in: it is an instance method called <code>initialize</code>, which sets up the object's internal state and brings it into a consistent, fully defined state which can be used by other objects.</p>

<p>So, in order to fully create a new object, what you need to do is this:</p>

<pre><code>x = X.allocate
x.initialize
</code></pre>

<p>[Note: Objective-C programmers may recognize this.]</p>

<p>However, because it is too easy to forget to call <code>initialize</code> and as a general rule an object should be fully valid after construction, there is a convenience factory method called <code>Class#new</code>, which does all that work for you and looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>class Class
  def new(*args, &amp;block)
    obj = alloc
    obj.initialize(*args, &amp;block)

    return obj
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>[Note: actually, <code>initialize</code> is private, so reflection has to be used to circumvent the access restrictions like this: <code>obj.send(:initialize, *args, &amp;block)</code>]</p>

<p>Lastly, let me explain what's going wrong in your <code>m</code> method. (The others have already explained how to solve it.)</p>

<p>In Ruby, there is no way (note: in Ruby, ""there is no way"" actually translates to ""there is always a way involving reflection"") to access an instance variable from outside the instance. That's why it's called an instance variable after all, because it belongs to the instance. This is a legacy from Smalltalk: in Smalltalk there are no visibility restrictions, <em>all</em> methods are public. Thus, instance variables are the <em>only</em> way to do encapsulation in Smalltalk, and, after all, encapsulation is one of the pillars of OO. In Ruby, there <em>are</em> visibility restrictions (as we have seen above, for example), so it is not strictly necessary to hide instance variables for that reason. There is another reason, however: the Uniform Access Principle.</p>

<p>The UAP states that how to <em>use</em> a feature should be independent from how the feature is <em>implemented</em>. So, accessing a feature should always be the same, i.e. uniform. The reason for this is that the author of the feature is free to change how the feature works internally, without breaking the users of the feature. In other words, it's basic modularity.</p>

<p>This means for example that getting the size of a collection should always be the same, regardless of whether the size is stored in a variable, computed dynamically every time, lazily computed the first time and then stored in a variable, memoized or whatever. Sounds obvious, but e.g. Java gets this wrong:</p>

<pre><code>obj.size # stored in a field
</code></pre>

<p>vs.</p>

<pre><code>obj.getSize() # computed
</code></pre>

<p>Ruby takes the easy way out. In Ruby, there is only <em>one</em> way to use a feature: sending a message. Since there is only one way, access is trivially uniform.</p>

<p>So, to make a long story short: you simply can't access another instance's instance variable. you can only interact with that instance via message sending. Which means that the other object has to either provide you with a method (in this case at least of <code>protected</code> visibility) to access its instance variable, or you have to violate that object's encapsulation (and thus lose Uniform Access, increase coupling and risk future breakage) by using reflection (in this case <code>instance_variable_get</code>).</p>

<p>Here it is, in all its glory:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env ruby

class X
  def initialize(a=1)
    @a = a
  end

  def m(other) 
    @a == other.a
  end

  protected

  attr_reader :a
end

require 'test/unit'
class TestX &lt; Test::Unit::TestCase
  def test_that_m_evaluates_to_true_when_passed_two_empty_xs
    x, y = X.new, X.new
    assert x.m(y)
  end
  def test_that_m_evaluates_to_true_when_passed_two_xs_with_equal_attributes
    assert X.new('foo').m(X.new('foo'))
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Or alternatively:</p>

<pre><code>class X
  def m(other) 
    @a == other.instance_variable_get(:@a)
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Which one of those two you chose is a matter of personly taste, I would say. The <code>Set</code> class in the standard library uses the reflection version, although <em>it</em> uses <code>instance_eval</code> instead:</p>

<pre><code>class X
  def m(other) 
    @a == other.instance_eval { @a }
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>(I have no idea why. Maybe <code>instance_variable_get</code> simply didn't exist when <code>Set</code> was written. Ruby is going to be 17 years old in February, some of the stuff in the stdlib is from the very early days.)</p>

"<p>I have a question regarding the and/&amp;&amp;/= keywords in Ruby.</p>

<p>The ruby docs say that the precedence for the mentioned keywords is: (1)&amp;&amp;, (2)=, (3)and.</p>

<pre><code>def f(n)

end

if a = f(2) and  b = f(4) then  
    puts ""1) #{a} #{b}""	
 end

if a = f(2) &amp;&amp;  b = f(4) then   
    puts ""2) #{a} #{b}""

<p>The output is:</p>

<p>1) 2 4 [Expected]</p>

<p>2) 4 4 [<strong>Why</strong>?]</p>

<p>For some reason using the &amp;&amp; causes both a and b to evaluate to 4?</p>
","2988","","<p>I don't quite understand the question you are asking. I mean, you have <em>already</em> given the answer yourself, <em>before</em> even asking the question: <code>&amp;&amp;</code> binds tighter than <code>=</code> while <code>and</code> binds less tightly than <code>=</code>.</p>

<p>So, in the first case, the expression is evaluated as follows:</p>

<pre><code>( a=f(2) )  and  ( b=f(4) )
( a=  2  )  and  ( b=f(4) )
      2     and  ( b=f(4) ) # a=2
      2     and  ( b=  4  ) # a=2
      2     and        4    # a=2; b=4
                       4    # a=2; b=4
</code></pre>

<p>In the second case, the evaluation is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>a   =   (  f(2) &amp;&amp; ( b=f(4) )  )
a   =   (    2  &amp;&amp; ( b=f(4) )  )
a   =   (    2  &amp;&amp; ( b=  4  )  )
a   =   (    2  &amp;&amp;       4     ) # b=4
a   =                    4       # b=4

","2988","","<p>Here's a couple of hints regarding your code:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>solve_maze</code> takes four parameters, but you are only passing one in the initial invocation (<code>solve_maze(maze)</code>)</li>
<li>All your objects are either strings or arrays of strings, but you are constantly doing integer math with them</li>
<li>You are constantly using <code>self</code> to refer to the current object, but you don't even <em>have</em> a current object, since you are writing in a procedural style, not an object-oriented one. [Note: I know that in Ruby, you <em>always</em> have a current object, which in this case is the anonymous top-level object.]</li>
</ul>

<p>Here's a couple of more hints regarding your workflow:</p>

<ul>
<li>Forget about the while loop. Why would you want the possibility of solving multiple mazes when you cannot even solve one at the momen? You can always add that in later.</li>
<li>Forget about reading the maze from a file, just hardcode it in a string. You can always add that in later.</li>
<li>In fact, forget about parsing the string altogether, just hardcode the maze in a datastructure that is convenient for you to deal with. I'd suggest a two-dimensional array of Booleans. You can always ... well, you get the drift.</li>
<li>Start with a simple maze. Like, <em>really</em> simple. Like, one tile where you already start up at the destination. Then move on to a maze with two tiles where the destination is right next to the start.</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples:</p>

<pre><code>solvable = [
  [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false],
  [false,  true,  true,  true,  true,  true,  true,  true,  true, false],
  [false, false, false, false, false, false,  true,  true,  true, false],
  [false,  true,  true,  true,  true,  true,  true,  true,  true, false],
  [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false]
]

unsolvable = [
  [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false],
  [false,  true,  true,  true,  true,  true,  true,  true,  true, false],
  [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false],
  [false,  true,  true,  true,  true,  true,  true,  true,  true, false],
  [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false]
]

start  = [1, 1]
finish = [3, 1]
</code></pre>

<p>This way, you can simply use <code>if</code> to check whether the path is free or not, since empty tiles are <code>true</code> and walls are <code>false</code></p>

<p>Here's a neat trick: in Ruby, everything which is not either <code>false</code> or <code>nil</code> is true. This means, you can put everything you want (except <code>false</code> or <code>nil</code>, of course) in there instead of <code>true</code> and the <code>if</code> trick will still work. For example, you can encode the distance information that the algorithm needs directly in the maze itself. Just put some <em>really</em> big number instead of <code>true</code> in there, and <code>0</code> into the finish:</p>

<pre><code>infin = 1.0/0.0

solvable = [
  [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false],
  [false, infin, infin, infin, infin, infin, infin, infin, infin, false],
  [false, false, false, false, false, false, infin, infin, infin, false],
  [false,   0  , infin, infin, infin, infin, infin, infin, infin, false],
  [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false]
]

unsolvable = [
  [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false],
  [false, infin, infin, infin, infin, infin, infin, infin, infin, false],
  [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false],
  [false,   0  , infin, infin, infin, infin, infin, infin, infin, false],
  [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false]
]

start  = [1, 1]
finish = [3, 1]
</code></pre>

<p>However, start simple:</p>

<pre><code>maze   = [[0]]
start  = [0, 0]
finish = [0, 0]

maze   = [[0, infin]]
start  = [0, 1]
finish = [0, 0]

maze = [
  [false, false, false],
  [false, infin, false],
  [false,   0  , false],
  [false, false, false]
]
start  = [1, 1]
finish = [2, 1]

maze = [
  [false, false, false],
  [false, infin, false],

  [false,   0  , false],
  [false, false, false]

"<p>I'm trying to develop a workflow which allows us to maintain seperate Visual studio 2005 and 2008 versions of a library, while making sure that changes to one branch are always replicated in the other branch.</p>

<p>At the moment, I recommend that changes are only ever made to the default (VS2005) branch and then once complete, merged into the VS2008 branch. Unfortunately this relies on the discipline not to just fix problems as and when they are found and when you are in a crunch, that can be difficult. This has resulted in me having to attempt to retrofit changes from one branch back into the default at a later date.</p>

<p>I know that we could store the changes between the VS2005 and VS2008 project in a patch queue, but I'm the only one in my team who is comfortable with using the command line, my colleagues prefer to do everything though Tortoise HG.</p>

<p>As such, I rely on fixing up problems after the fact. My current procedure involves exporting patches for every changeset in the VS2008 branch and applying them to the default branch. This is time consuming, but much less error prone than trying to merge the tip of the VS2008 branch with the tip of default, and then hand converting back to VS2005 by hand.</p>

<p>Having read <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1086222/in-mercurial-how-do-i-apply-a-reverse-patch-to-a-particular-file"">this article</a>, I tried backing out the 'upgrade' changeset, but the resulting backout changeset always ends up as the new tip of the VS2008 branch, plus I can't then merge the changes back in, since the resulting merge ends up in the VS2008 branch, even if I attempt to explicitly close the branch on commit.</p>

<p>I've tried going at this in a number of ways, but I always end up with a new VS2008 branch tip and no way to merge the changes back into the default branch. As such, I'm starting to thing that I've missed something obvious here.</p>

<p>So, ultimately, what do other people feel is best practice when trying to maintain two versions of a library where the only difference you want between the two are Visual Studio version numbers, embedded into the project and solution files?</p>

<p>Edit: The problem that I'm trying to avoid is that if you add a VS2005 project to a VS2008 solution (for easier debugging) it automatically 'upgrades' the VS2005 project to VS2008, resulting in a 'changed' working copy and a spattering of unecessary 'conversion' files. So, rather than people being tempted to commit their 'upgrade' to the mainline, I prefer to keep the branches seperate and require the user to pick the version they need on the first update after the clone.</p>

<hr>

<p>Further edit, with solution.</p>

<p>With some more messing about, I found a way to make this workflow work with standard TortoiseHg tools, and command line intervention only needed to set things up.</p>

<p>Firstly, I updated back to the changeset in which the project was converted from VS2005 to VS2008. I backed out that revision, created a patch of the backout and stripped the backed out changeset (since it was in the default branch). Then I applied the backout patch to the conversion changeset (using: hg patch --no-commit patch) and then comitted the patch with a new ""VS2005"" branch name. I then merged in the tip of the (unnamed) VS2005 branch.</p>

<p>The next step was to update to the old tip of the (unamed) VS2008 branch, make an inconsequential change and commit it as a new ""VS2008"" branch. I then merged in the changes from the VS2005 tip, but when I comitted did not allow the changes to the csproj files to be comitted. I then reverted these files after the commit.</p>

<p>Finally, I updated to the VS2005 tip and merged in the VS2008 tip.</p>

<p>This resulted in two tips, both with identical code, except for the differences due to the VS2005 to VS2008 conversion.</p>

<p>New workflow:</p>

<ul>
<li>Work in either VS2005 or VS2008 branch, as required.</li>
<li>Once updates are done in one branch, update to the other branch, merge the changes from the modified branch in and commit to it's own branch. Then update back to your preferred branch.</li>
<li>If updates occur in both branches simultaneously, do both branches seperately, i.e,. update to the VS2005 tip and merge in the VS2008 tip, then update to the VS2008 tip and merge in the previous (pre-merge) VS2005 tip.</li>

  <p>I want to create a simple linked list type of an object in ruby; where an instance variable in class points to another instance of same type.</p>

<p>Just a quick note: the word <em>type</em> is a very dangerous word in Ruby, especially if you come from Java. Due to an historic accident, the word is used both in dynamic typing and in static typing to mean two only superficially related, but very different things.</p>

<p>In dynamic typing, a type is a label that gets attached to a <em>value</em> (<em>not</em> a reference).</p>

<p>Also, in Ruby the concept of type is much broader than in Java. In Java programmer's minds, ""type"" means the same thing as ""class"" (although that's not true, since Interfaces and primitives are also types). In Ruby, ""type"" means ""what can I do with it"".</p>

<p>Example: in Java, when I say something is of type <em>String</em>, I mean it is a direct instance of the <code>String</code> class. In Ruby, when I say something is of type <em>String</em>, I mean it is either</p>

<ul>
<li>a direct instance of the <code>String</code> class or </li>
<li>an instance of a subclass of the <code>String</code> class or </li>
<li>an object which responds to the <code>#to_str</code> method or </li>
<li>an object which behaves indistinguishably from a String.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>I want to populate and link all nodes; before the constructor is called and only once. Something that we'd usually do in Java Static block.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In Ruby, everything is executable. In particular, there is no such thing as a ""class declaration"": a class body is just exectuable code, just like any other. If you have a list of method definitions in your class body, those are not declarations that are read by the compiler and then turned into a class object. Those are expressions that get executed by the evaluator one by one.</p>

<p>So, you can put any code you like into a class body, and that code will be evaluated when the class is created. Within the context of a class body, <code>self</code> is bound to the class (remember, classes are just objects like any other).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Initialize method is a constructor signature in ruby. Are there any rules around them? Like in Java you cannot call another constructor from a constructor if its not the first line (or after calling the class code?)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ruby doesn't <em>have</em> constructors. Constructors are just factory methods (with stupid restrictions); there is no reason to have them in a well-designed language, if you can just use a (more powerful) factory method instead.</p>

<p>Object construction in Ruby works like this: object construction is split into two phases, <em>allocation</em> and <em>initialization</em>. Allocation is done by a public class method called <code>allocate</code>, which is defined as an instance method of class <code>Class</code> and is generally <em>never</em> overriden. It just allocates the memory space for the object and sets up a few pointers, however, the object is not really usable at this point.</p>

<p>That's where the initializer comes in: it is an instance method called <code>initialize</code>, which sets up the object's internal state and brings it into a consistent, fully defined state which can be used by other objects.</p>

<p>So, in order to fully create a new object, what you need to do is this:</p>

<pre><code>x = X.allocate
x.initialize
</code></pre>

<p>[Note: Objective-C programmers may recognize this.]</p>

<p>However, because it is too easy to forget to call <code>initialize</code> and as a general rule an object should be fully valid after construction, there is a convenience factory method called <code>Class#new</code>, which does all that work for you and looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>class Class
  def new(*args, &amp;block)
    obj = alloc
    obj.initialize(*args, &amp;block)

    return obj
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>[Note: actually, <code>initialize</code> is private, so reflection has to be used to circumvent the access restrictions like this: <code>obj.send(:initialize, *args, &amp;block)</code>]</p>

<p>That, by the way, is the reason why to construct an object you <em>call</em> a public class method <code>Foo.new</code> but you <em>implement</em> a private instance method <code>Foo#initialize</code>, which seems to trip up a lot of newcomers.</p>

<p>To answer your question: since an initializer method is just a method like any other, there are absolutely no restrictions as to what you can do whithin an initializer, in particular you can call <code>super</code> whenever, wherever, however and how often you want.</p>

<p>BTW: since <code>initialize</code> and <code>new</code> are just normal methods, there is no reason why they need to be called <code>initialize</code> and <code>new</code>. That's only a convention, although a pretty strong one, since it is embodied in the core library. In your case, you want to write a collection class, and it is quite customary for a collection class to offer an alternative factory method called <code>[]</code>, so that I can call <code>List[1, 2, 3]</code> instead of <code>List.new(1, 2, 3)</code>.</p>

<p>Just as a side note: one obvious advantage of using normal methods for object construction is that you can construct instances of anonymous classes. This is not possible in Java, for absolutely no sensible reason whatsoever. The only reason why it doesn't work is that the constructor has the same name as the class, and anonymous classes don't have a name, ergo there cannot be a constructor.</p>

<p>Although I am not quite sure why you would need to run anything before object creation. Unless I am missing something, shouldn't a list basically be</p>

<pre><code>class List
  def initialize(head=nil, *tail)
    @head = head
    @tail = List.new(*tail) unless tail.empty?
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>for a Lisp-style cons-list or </p>

<pre><code>class List
  def initialize(*elems)
    elems.map! {|el| Element.new(el)}
    elems.zip(elems.drop(1)) {|prv, nxt| prv.instance_variable_set(:@next, nxt)}
    @head = elems.first
  end

  class Element
    def initialize(this)
      @this = this
    end
  end
end

<p>By ""fundamental"", I mean the real basic ones.

<li>Binary Search Trees</li>

"<p>I have reinstalled my computer with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows%5F7"">Windows 7</a>, and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse%5F%28software%29"">Eclipse</a> 3.5.1 (Galileo). </p>

<p>The weird thing is that I can not see any files that Eclipse produces.
I can not find the workspace, can not find the files from the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subversion%5F%28software%29"">SVN</a> after check out.</p>

<p>It seems like Windows 7 can not read the files produced by Eclipse ... wierd</p>

<p>What could be the reason for this?</p>
","2988","","<p>Where do you have Eclipse installed? Where is your workspace?</p>

<p>In Windows 7 (Vista, actually), a lot of security policies that existed only on paper in earlier versions of Windows, are now actually enforced by the operating system. For example, according to Microsoft's documentation, it has been pretty much illegal to write to <code>C:\Program Files</code> for decades now, but if you actually tried it, it still worked. Not anymore. As of Vista, <code>C:\Program Files</code> is off-limits.</p>

<p>However, in order not to break existing (broken) applications, Microsoft introduced filesystem virtualization. If an application tries to write to <code>C:\Program Files</code>, it gets silently redirected to <code>C:\Users\%Username%\AppData\Local\VirtualStore\Program Files</code>. So, this specific application sees all the files it created or changed in <code>C:\Program Files</code>, but <em>other</em> applications, and this includes the Explorer, see only the unchanged / empty directory.</p>

<p>This does not just apply to <code>C:\Program Files</code> but also to other system directories as well. Also, it applies to system parts of the registry, like <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</code> for example.</p>

<p>In order to sidestep all of this, I simply installed my copy of Eclipse in <code>%LocalAppData%\eclipse</code> (that's <code>C:\Users\%Username%\AppData\Local\eclipse</code>) and created my workspace in <code>%AppData%\eclipse</code> (that's <code>C:\Users\%Username%\AppData\Roaming\eclipse</code>). That <em>Just Works</em>&trade;.</p>

<p>Presumably, the reason <em>why</em> you want to know if it is installed, is because you need to run it later.

<p>The idea is that you have a collection of values and you want to ""reduce"" or ""fold"" that collection of multiple values into a single value.

"<p>I know of ""imperative"" and ""functional"" programming but there was little I could find on ""datatype"" programming. Is there such a thing and how is it related to the other paradigms?</p>
","2988","","<p>I have never heard of that term. Google hasn't, either. (The only hit is this very question.)</p>

<p>The closest thing I can think of, is <a href=""http://LucaCardelli.Name/"" rel=""nofollow""><em>Typeful Programming</em></a>, which is a programming paradigm introduced by Luca Cardelli in a 1989 <a href=""http://LucaCardelli.Name/Papers/TypefulProg.A4.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">paper</a> by the same title.</p>

<p>The idea of typeful programming is that you use types extensively and primarily to model your domain, drive your design, structure your program and in general solve your problem, the same way you use objects in object-oriented programming, procedures in procedural programming, functions in functional programming, clauses in logic programming, processes in Erlang, and so on. This is a typical style in Haskell.</p>

"<p>From my understanding, garbage collection in java cleans up some object iff nothing else is 'pointing' to that object.  My question is, what happens if we have something like:</p>

<pre><code>class Node{
    public object value;
    public Node next;
    public Node(object o, Node n) { value = 0; next = n;}
}

 //...some code
{
    Node a = new Node(""a"", null), 
         b = new Node(""b"", a), 
         c = new Node(""c"", b);
    a.next = c;
}//end of scope
//...other code
</code></pre>

<p><code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code> should be garbage collected, but they are all being referenced by other objects.  How does the Java garbage collection deal with this? (or is it simply a memory drain?)</p>
","2988","","<p>You are correct. The specific form of garbage collection you describe is called ""<em>reference counting</em>"". The way it works (conceptually, at least, most modern implementations of reference counting are actually implemented quite differently) in the simplest case, looks like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>whenever a reference to an object is added (e.g. it is assigned to a variable or a field, passed to method, and so on), its reference count is increased by 1</li>
<li>whenever a reference to an object is removed (the method returns, the variable goes out of scope, the field is re-assigned to a different object or the object which contains the field gets itself garbage collected), the reference count is decreased by 1</li>
<li>as soon as the reference count hits 0, there is no more reference to the object, which means nobody can use it anymore, therefore it is garbage and can be collected</li>
</ul>

<p>And this simple strategy has exactly the problem you decribe: if A references B and B references A, then both of their reference counts can <em>never</em> be less than 1, which means they will never get collected.</p>

<p>There are four ways to deal with this problem:</p>

<ol>
<li>Ignore it. If you have enough memory, your cycles are small and infrequent and your runtime is short, maybe you can get away with simply not collecting cycles. Think of a shell script interpreter: shell scripts typically only run for a few seconds and don't allocate much memory.</li>
<li>Combine your reference counting garbage collector with <em>another</em> garbage collector which doesn't have problems with cycles. CPython does this, for example: the main garbage collector in CPython is a reference counting collector, but from time to time a tracing garbage collector is run to collect the cycles.</li>
<li>Detect the cycles. Unfortunately, detecting cycles in a graph is a rather expensive operation. In particular, it requires pretty much the same overhead that a tracing collector would, so you could just as well use one of those.</li>
<li>Don't implement the algorithm in the naive way you and I would: since the 1970s, there have been multiple quite interesting algorithms developed that combine cycle detection and reference counting in a single operation in a clever way that is significantly cheaper than either doing them both seperately or doing a tracing collector.</li>
</ol>

<p>By the way, the <em>other</em> major way to implement a garbage collector (and I have already hinted at that a couple of times above), is <em>tracing</em>. A tracing collector is based on the concept of <em>reachability</em>. You start out with some <em>root set</em> that you know is <em>always</em> reachable (global constants, for example, or the <code>Object</code> class, the current lexical scope, the current stack frame) and from there you <em>trace</em> all objects that are reachable from the root set, then all objects that are reachable from the objects reachable from the root set and so on, until you have the transitive closure. Everything that is <em>not</em> in that closure is garbage.</p>

<p>Since a cycle is only reachable within itself, but not reachable from the root set, it will be collected.</p>

","2988","","<p>The file and line number are contained in the backtrace. However, in your case, the warning is inside a string being <code>eval</code>ed at runtime.

(Actually, the <code>eval</code> method <em>does</em> take optional arguments for the file name and line number that should be displayed in a backtrace, but in this case whoever wrote the code in question unfortunately forgot to pass those arguments.)</p>

<p>I fear that you have no other choice than to manually examine every single call to <code>eval</code> in your entire codebase, and that <em>includes</em> Rails, your testing framework, your entire application, your tests, your plugins, your helpers, the ruby standard library, ...</p>

<p>Note the difference between the two warning messages: the first one reads exactly like the one you posted, but the <em>second</em> one has the filename instead of <code>(eval)</code> and the line number inside the file instead of the line number inside the eval string.</p>

<p>By the way: the line number <code>289</code> in the warning message is the line number <em>inside the <code>eval</code>d string</em>! In other words: somewhere in your application there is a string being <code>eval</code>d, which is <em>at least</em> 289 lines long!

It is a question of the hardware (if the machine only has 1 CPU, it is simply physically impossible to execute two instructions at the same time), the Operating System (again, if the OS doesn't support true multithreading, there is nothing you can do) and the language implementation / execution engine.</p>

<p>Unless the language specification explicitly forbids or enforces true multithreading, this has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with the language.</p>

<p><em>All</em> the languages that you mention, plus all the languages that have been mentioned in the answers so far, have multiple implementations, some of which support true multithreading, some don't, and some are built on top of <em>other</em> execution engines which might or might not support true multithreading.</p>

<p>Take Ruby, for example. Here are just <em>some</em> of its implementations and their threading models:</p>

<ul>
<li>MRI: green threads, no true multithreading</li>
<li>YARV: OS threads, no true multithreading</li>
<li>Rubinius: OS threads, true multithreading</li>
<li>MacRuby: OS threads, true multithreading</li>
<li>JRuby, XRuby: JVM threads, depends on the JVM (if the JVM supports true multithreading, then JRuby/XRuby does, too, if the JVM doesn't, then there's nothing <em>they</em> can do about it)</li>
<li>IronRuby, Ruby.NET: just like JRuby, XRuby, but on the CLI instead of on the JVM</li>
</ul>

<p>See also <a href=""http://StackOverflow.Com/questions/56087/57802/#57802"">my answer to another similar question about Ruby</a>. (Note that that answer is more than a year old, and some of it is no longer accurate. Rubinius, for example, uses truly concurrent native threads now, instead of truly concurrent green threads. Also, since then, several <em>new</em> Ruby implementations have emerged, such as BlueRuby, tinyrb, Ruby Go Lightly, Red Sun and SmallRuby.)</p>

<p>Similar for Python:</p>

<ul>
<li>CPython: native threads, no true multithreading</li>
<li>PyPy: native threads, depends on the execution engine (PyPy can run natively, or on top of a JVM, or on top of a CLI, or on top of <em>another</em> Python execution engine. Whenever the underlying platform supports true multithreading, PyPy does, too.)</li>
<li>Unladen Swallow: native threads, currently no true multithreading, but fix is planned</li>
<li>Jython: JVM threads, see JRuby</li>
<li>IronPython: CLI threads, see IronRuby</li>
</ul>

<p>For Haskell, at least the Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compiler supports true multithreading with native threads. I don't know about UHC, LHC, JHC, YHC, HUGS or all the others.</p>

<p>For Erlang, <em>both</em> BEAM and HiPE support true multithreading with green threads.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>2) If a program contains threads, will a Virtual Machine automatically assign work to multiple cores (or to physical CPUs if there is more than 1 CPU on the mainboard)?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again: this depends on the Virtual Machine, the Operating System and the hardware. Also, some of the implementations mentioned above, don't even <em>have</em> Virtual Machines.</p>

<p>No, it's because there is a myth that Operating Systems can only be written in C. A myth that can be trivially proven false, yet still refuses to die.</p>

"<p>Could someone give me a clear distinction between latent and manifest type system?</p>
","2988","","<p>Sometimes, the same concept gets invented independently in different areas of computer science. This is one of those occasions. What the Scheme community calls <em>latent</em> and <em>manifest</em> typing, the rest of the world calls <em>implicit</em> and <em>explicit</em> typing. The meaning is exactly the same:</p>

<p>In <em>explicit</em> / <em>manifest</em> typing, the programmer has to <em>explicitly</em> write down the types, thus the types become <em>manifest</em> in the source code.</p>

<p>In <em>implicit</em> / <em>latent</em> typing, the programmer does not write down the types. The types are thus <em>implicit</em> or <em>latent</em>.</p>

<p>Please note that the question of implicit vs. explicit typing is completely orthogonal to e.g. dynamic vs. static typing, strong vs. weak typing, sound vs. unsound typing, safe vs. unsafe typing and nominal vs. structural vs. duck typing.</p>

<p>Haskell for example is implicitly, strongly, statically, sound, safe, structurally typed.</p>

<p>Ruby is Turing-complete, which means that <em>everything</em> that can be written in <em>any other</em> Turing-complete language, can <em>also</em> be written in Ruby. Also, no language can be <em>more</em> than Turing-complete, which means that <em>anything</em> that <em>can't</em> be written in Ruby, can also not be written in any <em>other</em> language.</p>

<p>One very famous application that is a) famous completely independent from Ruby, and b) famous long before Rails came along, is FreeBSD's <code>portupgrade</code> command.</p>

<p><a href=""http://NASARb.RubyForge.Org/"">NASA</a> uses Ruby for statistics, simulation and also unit testing Fortran programs.</p>

<p>The Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) has an autonomous underwater laboratory, called the <a href=""http://MBARI.Org/ESP/"">Environmental Sample Processor (ESP)</a> which can collect water, particle and microorganism samples from the ocean and run several molecular experiments and genome analysis right there, under water, all by itself. It runs Ruby. Now, it's not commercial, and probably doesn't count as famous, either, but hey, it's a friggin' underwater robot!</p>

<p>Note: there are <em>many</em> more. I tried to find the <em>least</em> obvious ones I could think of, since I figured someone else would post Twitter and Basecamp anyway.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Well, there are multiple web servers written in Ruby; one of them (WEBRick) ships in the Ruby standard library. There are also multiple desktop applications written in Ruby (some listed above).</p>

<p>Adobe Lightroom is written largely in Lua, with only the hardcore image processing done in some lower-level language (I <em>think</em> C, but I suspect there might be a whole lot of MMX/SSE assembly in there, too) but the UI, the batch processing, and application logic are all implemented in Lua. Also, Lightroom is developed in an IDE Adobe specifically wrote for this task, which is written 100% in Lua. There is no reason why the same couldn't be done in Ruby. There is also no reason why there would <em>have</em> to be C or assembly in there, it's just that modern mainstream CPUs are heavily tuned for C and pretty hostile for languages like Ruby or Lua. Also, Adobe is a pretty old company, so they have tons of image manipulation code written in C or assembly just lying around, so why rewrite it?</p>

<p>As for operating systems: like with Photoshop, I don't know that anybody has done it <em>yet</em>, but there is no reason why they shouldn't be able to. Ruby is closely related to Lisp and Smalltalk, and both of these have multiple operating systems written in them.</p>

<p>Now, whether you can actually get a <em>job</em> writing an OS in Ruby, that's a whole other question :-)</p>

<p>However, there is pretty much no execution environment for which no Ruby execution engine is available. For the JVM, there is JRuby, which also runs on Java ME smartphones, Android and Google App Engine. For the CLI, there is (soon) IronRuby, which runs on all the important CLI variants: .NET, Mono and Silverlight. For the Objective-C runtime, there is MacRuby, which is officially sponsored by Apple and is indeed targeted to become a standard way to develop OSX desktop applications. (It's also probably going to run on the iPhone, although the MacRuby developers, being Apple employees, are not allowed to officially acknowledge that fact.) For Unix-like systems, there are MRI, YARV and (soon) Rubinius, which also run on Windows and many other systems, although maybe not quite as fast and stable.</p>

"<p>David Korn, a proponent of the Unix philosophy, chided Perl programmers a few years ago in <a href=""http://news.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=01/02/06/2030205&amp;mode=thread"">a Slashdot interview</a> for writing monolithic Perl scripts without making use of the Unix toolkit through pipes, redirection, etc. ""Unix is not just an operating system,"" he said, ""it is a way of doing things, and the shell plays a key role by providing the glue that makes it work.""</p>

<p>It seems that reminder could apply equally to the Ruby community. Ruby has great features for working together with other Unix tools through popen, STDIN, STDOUT, STDERR, ARGF, etc., yet it seems that increasingly, Rubyists are opting to use Ruby bindings and Ruby libraries and build monolithic Ruby programs.</p>

<p>I understand that there may be performance reasons in certain cases for going monolithic and doing everything in one Ruby process, but surely there are a lot of offline and asynchronous tasks that could be well handled by Ruby programs working together with other small programs each doing one thing well in the Unix fashion, with all the advantages that this approach offers. </p>

<p>Maybe I'm just missing something obvious. Is the Unix Philosophy still as relevant today as it was 10 years ago?</p>
","2988","","<p>I guess the rather simple explanation is that Unix tools are only available on Unix. The vast majority of users, however, run Windows.</p>

<p>I remember the last time I tried to install Nokogiri, it failed because it couldn't run <code>uname -p</code>. There was absolutely no valid reason to do that. All the information that can be obtained by running <code>uname -p</code> is also available from within Ruby. Plus, <code>uname -p</code> is actually not even Unix, it's a non-standard GNU extension which isn't even guaranteed to work on Unix, and is for example completely broken on several Linux distributions.</p>

<p>So, you could either use Unix and lose 90% of your users, or use Ruby.</p>

"<p>After reading about Erlang's lighweight processes I was pretty much sure that they were ""green threads"". Until I read that there are differences between green threads and Erlang's processes. But I don't get it.</p>

","2988","","<p>When people object to calling Erlang's processes ""green threads"", they aren't objecting to the ""green"" part, they are objecting to the ""threads"" part.</p>

<p>Erlang's processes share nothing, thus, they are true processes. However, they are usually implemented in a ""green"" manner. So, technically, they are ""green processes"".</p>

<p>I usually call them ""green threads"" when I want to emphasize the light weight <em>implementation</em>, and call them ""processes"" when I want to emphasize the shared-nothing <em>semantics</em>. That way I don't have to explain what I mean by ""green processes"".</p>

"<p>I am trying to remove text that is within parentheses (along with the parentheses themselves) but am having trouble with the scenario where there are parentheses within parentheses.  This is the method I am using (in Ruby): </p>

<pre><code>sentence.gsub(/\(.*?\)/, """")
</code></pre>

<p>and that works fine until I have a sentence such as: </p>

<pre><code>""This is (a test (string))""
</code></pre>

<p>Then the above chokes.  Anyone have any idea how to do this? I am completely stumped.</p>
","2988","","<p>The problem with this is that languages containing nested parentheses (or indeed <em>anything</em> nested, IOW anything that requires recursion) are not regular, they are at least context-free. This means that they cannot be described by a regular grammar. Regular expressions are a compact notation for regular grammars. Ergo, nested parentheses cannot be described by regular expressions.</p>

<p>However, we aren't talking about regular expressions here, we are talking about <code>Regexp</code>s. While their semantics and syntax are (very) loosely based on regular expressions, they are quite different and especially much more powerful. Depending on the particular flavor of <code>Regexp</code> you use, they may or may not be able to express recursion and thus parse nested parentheses. Perl <code>Regex</code>, for example <em>can</em> parse nested parentheses. I'm not sure whether Ruby's <code>Regexp</code> can, but I really don't care, because the way that <code>Regexp</code> are more powerful than regular expressions is generally achieved by bolting more and more syntax onto them.</p>

<p>This turns regular expressions, which are designed to be simple, in incomprehensible monsters. (If you can tell at a glance what the Perl <code>Regex</code> posted by @Anon does, then go for it. But I can't and thus I prefer not to use it.)</p>

<p>I prefer using a more powerful parser, rather than a complex <code>Regexp</code>.</p>

<p>In this case, you have a context-free language, therefore you can use a very simple recursive descent parser. You can further simplify your recursive descent parser by handling those sub-parts which <em>are</em> regular with a regular expression. Finally, if you replace the recursion in the recursive descent parser with iteration + mutation and make clever use of Ruby's boolean semantics, the entire parser gets basically condensed down to this single line:</p>

<pre><code>while str.gsub!(/\([^()]*?\)/, ''); end
</code></pre>

<p>Which I don't think is too bad.</p>

<p>Here's the entire thing with some extra removal of duplicate whitespace and (of course) a test suite:</p>

<pre><code>require 'test/unit'
class TestParenthesesRemoval &lt; Test::Unit::TestCase
  def test_that_it_removes_even_deeply_nested_parentheses
    str = 'This is (was?) some ((heavily) parenthesized (but not overly so 
          (I hope))) text with (superflous) parentheses: )(.'
    res = 'This is some text with parentheses: )(.'

    while str.gsub!(/\([^()]*?\)/, ''); end
    str.squeeze!(' ')

    assert_equal res, str
  end
end

","2988","","<p>The answer to <em>both</em> of your questions is <a href=""http://SelfLanguage.Org/"">Self</a>. Self is the <em>original</em> prototype-based OO language, and also probably the best one (for a completely unscientific and subjective definition of ""best"", of course). (In fact, IMHO it's (together with <a href=""http://NewspeakLanguage.Org/"">Newspeak</a>) one of the best OO languages, period.)</p>

<p>Anyway, the nice thing about Self is that it also contains a lot of excellent <a href=""http://SelfLanguage.Org/documentation/"">documentation</a>, including but not limited to the famous Self tutorial <em><a href=""http://SelfLanguage.Org/%5Fstatic/tutorial/Tutorial/"">Prototype-Based Application Construction Using SELF 4.0</a></em></p>

<p>There are also a great number of resources at the <a href=""http://Research.Sun.Com/self/"">old Self website at Sun Research</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li><em><a href=""http://Research.Sun.Com/self/papers/self-power.html"">Self: The Power of Simplicity</a></em> is the original paper that introduced Self at OOPSLA 1987</li>
<li><em><a href=""http://Research.Sun.Com/self/papers/programming-as-experience.html"">Programming as an Experience: The Inspiration for Self</a></em> is a retrospective paper about Self from ECOOP 1995</li>
</ul>

<p>These two (together with the tutorial mentioned above) explain pretty much exactly what you are asking about. (In fact, the second one pretty much contains your question <em>""How can I manage the code without classes""</em> word for word in the title):</p>

<p>Then, there is <em>Self; The Movie</em>, an introductory video about the Self programming language, the Self GUI, the Self system and the Self VM starring Self's lead designers and developers. Unfortunately, it came out in 1995 on VHS, and when the video was finally digitized, the original tapes were already degraded. You can find several versions of the video on <a href=""http://Smalltalk.Org.Br/movies/"">this site with Smalltalk videos</a>.

<p>A slight problem with Self is that it was basically abandoned by Sun in 1995 in favor of an obscure little scripting language for making animated cartoon characters in electronic TV guides on TV set-top-boxes. (You might have heard of it, it's called Java.) Thus, the latest stable release 4.3 only runs on OSX on PowerPC ( <em>maybe</em> x86, too) and Solaris on a Sparc CPU. A couple of months ago, though, the Self project was picked up again by some of its former members as well as some new fans of the language, and it has now been ported to Linux and OSX on x86, with a usable 4.4 Alpha 2 release available and a final release expected in January.</p>

","2988","","<p>Why don't you just get CentOS's SRPM for the grep binary and compare their compile options to yours? I would guess that this is much more efficient than having the entire StackOverflow community blindly poke around in the dark until they hit something.</p>

<p>EDIT: Are you using a locale with a multibyte encoding? (Note: if you have no idea what that means, then the answer is probably ""Yes"", since UTF-8 has been the default for most Linux distributions for several years now and indeed RedHat (and thus CentOS) were the very first to make the switch).</p>

<p>In that case, GNU grep <em>is</em> dog slow. And this not only applies to GNU grep but to pretty much all GNU tools that do some kind of text processing. The FSF refuses to accept any patches to improve multibyte performance, unless those patches are proven to not slow down fixed-width encodings. However, since <em>any</em> patch to improve performance for multibyte encodings must <em>at least</em> contain some <code>if</code> statement somewhere, it is actually impossible to write a patch that does not at least slow down fixed-width encodings by at least the overhead of that <code>if</code> statement. Thus, UTF-8 performance of GNU tools <em>will</em> continue to suck until the end of time.</p>

<p>Anyway, most Linux distributors don't give a rat's <em>bleep</em> what the FSF thinks and patch GNU grep anyway. The <a href=""ftp://Download.Fedora.RedHat.Com/pub/fedora/linux/development/source/SRPMS/grep-2.5.3-6.fc12.src.rpm"">Fedora Rawhide SRPM</a> contains a patch called <a href=""https://Savannah.GNU.Org/patch/?3803""><code>grep-2.5.3-egf-speedup.patch</code></a>, which speeds up the UTF-8 performance of GNU grep by several orders of magnitude. (Since this patch is already from 2005, I assume that it is also used in CentOS.) This patch is also used in Mac OSX, Debian, Ubuntu, ..., pretty much nobody uses GNU grep as distributed by GNU. Text processing in a multibyte encoding will never be as fast as in a fixed-width encoding, but it should at least be comparable, not 50x (or even 1500x as some people have reported) slower.</p>

<p>There's also another patch called <a href=""https://Savannah.GNU.Org/patch/?3802""><code>dfa-optional</code></a>, which makes grep simply use GNU libc's regex engine instead of its own, which is not only <em>much</em> faster when dealing with UTF-8 but also has far fewer bugs.</p>

<p>So, you might want to re-run your benchmarks with <code>export LC_ALL=POSIX</code> set. If that fixes your problem, you need to apply either one of the two above-mentioned patches.</p>

<p>More information is also available in these two RedHat bugreports:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://Bugzilla.RedHat.Com/show%5Fbug.cgi?id=69900"">Bug 69900 - grep writing output very slow</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://Bugzilla.RedHat.Com/show%5Fbug.cgi?id=121313"">Bug 121313 - grep SLOW on multibyte LC_CTYPE</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The moral of the story: despite popular belief, the Linux distributors <em>do</em> know what they are doing, at least sometimes. Don't second-guess them.</p>

"<p>I've written a Ruby script that is reading a file (<code>File.read()</code>) that contains unicode characters, and it works fine from the command line.</p>

<p>However, when I try to put it into an Automator Workflow (Mac OS X), I get this error;</p>

<pre><code>2009-12-23 17:55:15 -0500: /Users/jeffreyaylesworth/bin/symbols:19:in `split': invalid byte sequence in US-ASCII (ArgumentError)

</code></pre>

<p>So when running from Automator, split suddenly doesn't like non ASCII characters. As far as I can tell, both are running from the same version of Ruby (the version number is the same).</p>

<p>I'm not too concerned about why they are acting different (but if someone knows, that's great), but I would like a solution to make split accept non ASCII characters.</p>

<p>If it helps, I need to split text at a single character into two pieces, so if something that's similar to C's tokenizer would work, I can use that.</p>
","2988","","<p>You don't specify the encoding of the file. Since it is impossible to reliably determine the encoding of a file automatically, the encoding must be explicitly specified. If it isn't, the external encoding is used, if that isn't set, the encoding specified in the environment is going to be used, and if the environment doesn't specify an encoding, the file is assumed to be in 7 bit US-ASCII.</p>

<p>In your case, it seems that there is either a difference in the two environments (automated scripts are often run in a very restrictive environment without locale settings) or in the way the interpreter gets invoked.</p>

<p>So, you'd need to do something like</p>

<pre><code>File.read('/path/to/file', encoding: 'UTF-8')

<p>In Ruby, for example, there are only two DI frameworks. Both were written by a Java programmer. Neither of the two frameworks is used by a <em>single</em> project. Not even by the <em>author</em> of those frameworks.</p>

<p>However, DI is used all over the place in Ruby.</p>

<p>Jamis Buck, who is the author of both of those frameworks gave a talk called <em><a href=""http://RubyConf2008.ConFreaks.Com/recovering-from-enterprise.html"">Recovering from Enterprise</a></em> at RubyConf 2008 about how and why he wrote those frameworks and why that was a bad idea, which is well worth watching.

"<p>When we bid for Government RFP's they usually ask us to use 'Open source technologies'. Since Microsoft.NET framework is free to use, can it be considered 'open source technology' for this purpose?</p>
","2988","","<p>No, the .NET framework is <em>not</em> Open Source, it's a proprietary Microsoft product. In fact, .NET already fails the most obvious requirement for being Open Source: its source is not open.</p>

<p>The price has absolutely <em>nothing</em> to do with it. (Quite the opposite, actually: one of the freedoms granted by Open Source is to charge however much you want.)</p>

<p>The question of whether or not something is Open Source is a question of copyright and, more broadly, intellectual property.</p>

<p>Just the availability of <em>complete</em> source code for the <em>entire</em> product is not enough. The copyright license covering the source code must also allow anyone (without discrimination against either people, fields of use or combination of the product with other products) to <em>modify</em> the product and distribute and sell the modified product (also re-distribute and sell the original product).</p>

<p>The <em>exact</em> definition of Open Source is given by the Open Source Initiative in its <a href=""http://OpenSource.Org/docs/osd/"" rel=""nofollow"">Open Source Definition</a> (<a href=""http://OpenSource.Org/docs/definition.php"" rel=""nofollow"">annotated version</a>). Note that .NET violates <em>at least</em> articles 1, 2, 3, 6, 7 and maybe 5. A full ist of all copyright licenses that have been certified by the OSI to conform to the OSD can be found <a href=""http://OpenSource.Org/licenses/"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>. Note again that .NET's license is <em>not</em> listed here.</p>

<p>Another, related, definition is the <a href=""http://GNU.Org/philosophy/free-sw.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Free Software Definition</a> by the Free Software Foundation. Note that .NET violates all four freedoms. The FSF also maintains a <a href=""http://GNU.Org/licenses/license-list.html"" rel=""nofollow"">list of licenses that conform to the FSD</a>. Again, .NET's license is not listed as a Free Software License.</p>

<p>That said, a small subset of .NET 2.0 has been standardized as ECMA-335 and ISO/IEC 23271:2006 (CLI), ECMA-334 and ISO/IEC 23270:2006 (C#) and ECMA-372 (C++/CLI). However, this <em>only</em> covers .NET 2.0, so no WPF, no Silverlight, no LINQ, no local variable type inference, no generic co- and contravariance, no anonymous types, no expression trees, no extension methods, no lambda expressions, no <code>dynamic</code>. It also only covers a subset of .NET 2.0, some notable missing features are Visual Basic.NET, WinForms, ASP.NET and in general everything having to with Windows interop or COM interop.</p>

<p>There <em>are</em> Open Source implementations of ECMA-334/335/372, most notably <a href=""http://Mono-Project.Com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Mono</a>. In fact, Mono not only implements the ECMA specifications, but some other parts as well, such as some .NET 3.0, 3.5 and even 4.0 compatibility, Moonlight (compatible with Silverlight 2.0), ASP.NET.</p>

<p>However, those parts that go beyond the ECMA specifications are not covered by Microsoft's Specification Patent Promise, and thus at least some people fear that those parts might be subject to patent litigations. (Although that is IMHO very unlikely, and easy to circumvent.)</p>

"<p>I just wondered whether there is any good reason for or even an advantage in having to invoke <code>Proc</code>s using <code>proc.call(args)</code> in Ruby, which makes higher-order function syntax much more verbose and less intuitive.</p>

<p>Why not just <code>proc(args)</code>? Why draw a distinction between functions, lambdas and blocks? Basically, it's all the same thing so why this confusing syntax? Or is there any point for it I don't realize?</p>
","2988","","<p>You <em>need</em> some way to distinguish between <em>calling</em> the <code>Proc</code> and <em>passing</em> it around.</p>

<p>In Python and ECMAScript, it's simple: with parentheses it's a call, without it's not. In Ruby, leaving off the parentheses is <em>also</em> a call, therefore, there must be some <em>other</em> way to distinguish.</p>

<p>In Ruby 1.8, <code>Proc#call</code> and its alias <code>Proc#[]</code> serve that distinction. As of Ruby 1.9, there is a new allowed method name <code>()</code> which gets called like this <code>obj.()</code> and <code>Proc#()</code> is <em>also</em> an alias for <code>Proc#call</code>.</p>

<p>So, you can call a <code>Proc</code> like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>foo.call(1, 2, 3)</li>
<li>foo[1, 2, 3]</li>
<li>foo.(1, 2, 3)</li>
</ul>

<p>to this:</p>

<pre><code>raise ArgumentError, ""Invalid direction"" if !VALID_DIRECTIONS.include?(direction)

<p>I like how it makes the code more succinct.  However, I can see it potentially misleading at a first glance and imposing a readability issue, because it places the effect before the condition.  Then again, maybe that's just because I'm so used to C-style languages.</p>

<p>Has anyone run into trouble as a result of using statement modifiers, or do you feel they have improved your code?  Also, does anyone have general guidelines for using the modifiers (i.e., works particularly well for some operations, or not for some others)?</p>
","2988","","<p>I find that I usually have no trouble reading those trailing conditionals (as they are also sometimes called), provided that <em>other</em> code readability guidelines are still followed. Putting a 60 character expression and a 40 character condition on the same line, you are going to end up with a 100 character gob of text, which is surely going to be unreadable, completely independent of the issue of trailing conditionals.</p>

<p>In the specific code sample you are showing, it is pretty much obvious that there <em>must</em> be a conditional following. Who would want to <code>raise</code> an <code>ArgumentError</code> without even taking a look at the arguments first?</p>

<p>Also, trailing conditionals are similar to guard clauses in math and functional languages, which also tend to be written <em>after</em> the expression they are guarding.</p>

<p>Last but not least, putting a couple of <code>raise Bar if foo</code> and <code>return nil if quux</code> expressions at the beginning of methods, as kind of guards, is actually considered <em>good</em> style, to simplify the control flow of the method. Again: since these come at the beginning of the method, it is kind of obvious that there <em>has</em> to be a condition, otherwise <code>return</code>ing from the beginning of the method wouldn't make sense.</p>

<p><hr></p>

"<p>In Python if i want to give out an app without sources i can compile it in bytecode .pyc, is there a way to do something like it in ruby?</p>
","2988","","<p>I wrote a <a href=""http://StackOverflow.Com/questions/884186/can-ruby-php-or-perl-create-a-pre-compiled-file-for-the-code-like-python/885171/#885171"">much more detailed answer to this question</a> over at the question <a href=""http://StackOverflow.Com/questions/884186/""><em>Can Ruby, PHP, or Perl create a pre-compiled file for the code like Python?</em></a></p>

<p>The answer is: it depends. The Ruby <em>Language</em> has no provisions for compiling to bytecode and/or running bytecode. It also has no specfication of a bytecode format. The reason for this is simple: it would be much too restricting for language implementors if they were forced to use a specific bytecode format, or even bytecodes at all. For example, XRuby and JRuby compile to JVM bytecode, Ruby.NET and IronRuby compile to CIL bytecode, Cardinal compiles to PAST, SmallRuby compiles to Smalltalk/X bytecode, MagLev compiles to GemStone/S bytecode. For all of these implementations it would be plain stupid to use any other bytecode format than the one they currently use, since their whole point is interoperating with other language implementations that use the same bytecode format.</p>

<p>Simlar for MacRuby: it compiles to native code, not bytecode. Again, using bytecode would be stupid, since one of the goals is to run Ruby on the iPhone, which pretty much requires native code.</p>

<p>And of course there is MRI, which is a pure AST-walking script interpreter and thus doesn't have a bytecode format.</p>

<p>That being said, there <em>are</em> some Ruby <em>Implementations</em> which allow compiling to and loading from bytecode. Rubinius allows that, for example. (Indeed, it <em>has</em> to have that functionality since its Ruby compiler is written in Ruby, and thus the compiler must be compiled to Rubinius bytecode first, in order to solve the Catch-22.)</p>

<p>YARV also can save and load bytecode, although the loading functionality is currently disabled until a bytecode verifier is implemented that prevents users from loading manipulated bytecode that could crash or otherwise subvert the interpreter.</p>

<p>But, of course, both of these have their own bytecode formats and don't understand each other's (nor tinyrb's or RubyGoLightly's or ...) Also, neither of those formats is understood by a JVM or a CLR and vice versa.</p>

<p>However, the whole point is irrelevant because, as Mark points out, you can always reverse engineer the byte code anyway, especially in cases like CPython, PyPy, Rubinius, YARV, tinyrb, RubyGoLightly, where the bytecode format was specifically designed to be very close to the source language.</p>

<p>In general it is simply impossible to protect code that way. The reason is simple: you want the machine to be able to execute the code. (Otherwise what's the point in writing it in the first place?) However, in order to execute the code, the machine must <em>understand</em> the code. Since machines are much dumber than humans, it follows that any code that can be understood by a machine can just as well be understood by a human, no matter whether that code happens to be in source form, bytecode, assembly, native code or a deck of punch cards.</p>

<p>There is only one workable technical solution: if you control the <em>entire</em> execution pipeline, i.e. build your own CPU, your own computer, your own operating system, your own compiler, your own interpreter, and so forth and use strong cryptography to protect all of those, <em>then</em> and <em>only</em> then <em>might</em> you be able to protect your code. However, as e.g. Microsoft found out the hard way with the XBox 360, even doing all of that and hiring some of the smartest cryptographers and mathematicians on the planet, doesn't guarantee success.</p>

<p>The only <em>real</em> solution is not a technical but a social one: as soon as you have written your code, it is <em>automatically</em> fully protected by copyright law, without you having to do one single thing. That's it. Your code is protected.</p>

<p>Emacs has a similar concept, called <a href=""http://GNU.Org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Specifying-File-Variables.html#Specifying-File-Variables"">File Variables</a>.</p>

<p>File Variables are either specified at the beginning of the file (in the first line, or if there is a shebang line, then in the second) in this form:</p>

<pre><code>/* *-* mode: cc c-basic-offset: 4; tab-width: 4; indent-tabs-mode: nil *-* */
</code></pre>

<p>or at the end:</p>

<pre><code># Local Variables:
# mode: ruby
# coding: utf-8
# c-basic-offset: 2
# tab-width: 2
# indent-tabs-mode: nil
# End:
</code></pre>

<h2>jEdit</h2>

<p>jEdit calls this <a href=""http://jEdit.Org/users-guide/buffer-local.html"">buffer-local properties</a>. The have to sit within the first or last 10 lines and look like this:</p>

<pre><code># :mode=ruby:indentSize=2:tabSize=2:noTabs=true:
</code></pre>

<p>jEdit also uses the shebang line as a fallback for mode detection.</p>

<h2>Komodo Edit</h2>

<p>There is a plugin called <a href=""http://Community.ActiveState.Com/forum/komode-modeline-support-komodo/"">Komode</a> (pun intended) which adds modeline support to Komodo Edit:</p>

<pre><code># komode: le=unix language=ruby codepage=utf8 tab=2 notabs indent=2
</code></pre>

<p>It also understands a limited subset of Vim modelines.</p>

<h2>Others</h2>

<p>A lot of other editors also have either their own variants of this, or support one of the above (usually Vim).</p>

<h2>Python / Ruby encoding</h2>

<p>Both Ruby 1.9 and Python require that the encoding for non-ASCII source files be explicitly specified. Fortunately, they do this in a way that is compatible with both Emacs and Vim modelines. (Basically, they look for the string <code>coding</code> followed by a non-word character followed by whitespace followed by a valid encoding name. Both Vim's <code>fileencoding=</code> and Emacs' <code>coding:</code> satisfy these requirements.)</p>

<h2>Modeline Generator</h2>

<p>Here is a simple <a href=""http://Wireshark.Org/tools/modelines.html"">modeline generator</a>, which generates modelines for Vim, Emacs and jEdit.</p>

"<p>I am using the authlogic gem with Ruby on Rails, and I have been using the following to obtain the id of the user that is currently logged in:</p>

<pre><code>current_user = UserSession.find
id = current_user &amp;&amp; current_user.record.id
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not understanding how current_user &amp;&amp; current_user.record.id returns the current user id. I would think this would return a boolean. Can someone explain how this works?</p>
","2988","","<p>There is no <code>Boolean</code> type in Ruby; Ruby has a rather simple view of truth (or more precisely, it has a rather simple view of <em>falsehood</em>).</p>

<ul>
<li>the <code>false</code> object, which is the singleton instance of <code>FalseClass</code> is considered <strong>falsy</strong></li>
<li>the <code>nil</code> object, which is the singleton instance of <code>NilClass</code> is <strong>falsy</strong></li>
<li><em>every other object</em> is <strong>truthy</strong> (including, obviously, the <code>true</code> object, which is the singleton instance of <code>TrueClass</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>[BTW: this means that a lot of objects that are considered <strong>falsy</strong> in some other languages, are actually <strong>truthy</strong> in Ruby, like the integer <code>0</code>, the real value <code>0.0</code>, the empty string, the empty array, the empty hash, the character <code>'F'</code>]</p>

<p>So, the Boolean operators <code>&amp;&amp;</code>, <code>||</code>, <code>and</code> and <code>or</code> <em>do not</em> return Boolean values. Instead they return <em>the first object that determines the outcome of the expression</em>.</p>

<p>(They are also short-circuiting, which means that they only evaluate the minimum sub-expressions that are needed to determine the outcome of the expression. So, an alternate formulation would be that they return the result of the last expression that was evaluated. Which, in turn, is analogous to what blocks, methods, class bodies and module bodies do.)</p>

<p>So, what does it <em>mean</em> to return the first object that determines the outcome? That's simple, really: the result of the expression</p>

<pre><code> a &amp;&amp; b
</code></pre>

<p>is <strong>truthy</strong> if <em>both</em> <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are <strong>truthy</strong>, otherwise it is <strong>falsy</strong>. So, if <code>a</code> is <strong>falsy</strong>, it is <em>completely</em> irrelevant what <code>b</code> is: the result will be <strong>falsy</strong> either way. So, we might just as well simply return <code>a</code>. (Remember, a doesn't have to be <code>false</code>, it could also be <code>nil</code> and the programmer might want to know which one of the two it was.)</p>

<p>If, OTOH, <code>a</code> is <strong>truthy</strong> (IOW it is neither <code>nil</code> nor <code>false</code>), then the result of the whole expression is <em>solely</em> dependent on <code>b</code>: if <code>b</code> is <strong>truthy</strong>, the whole result will be <strong>truthy</strong>, otherwise if <code>b</code> is <strong>falsy</strong>, the whole result will be <strong>falsy</strong>. So, we might just as well return <code>b</code> itself, instead of first converting it to a Boolean.</p>

<p><code>||</code> and <code>or</code> are analogous or more precisely <em>dual</em> to <code>&amp;&amp;</code> and <code>and</code>.</p>

<p>You posted this example:</p>

<pre><code>id = current_user &amp;&amp; current_user.record.id
</code></pre>

<p>Here, the author isn't even <em>expecting</em> <code>current_user</code> to be a Boolean value! Instead, he expects it to be either a <code>User</code> or <code>nil</code>. But that's perfectly fine, because a <code>User</code> is <strong>truthy</strong> and <code>nil</code> is <strong>falsy</strong>, so they still can be used in a Boolean expression.</p>

<p>The basic intention is that the author wants to prevent a <code>NoMethodError</code> exception being raised, if he tries to call <code>#record</code> on <code>nil</code>.</p>

<p>An alternative way of expressing this would be </p>

<pre><code>id = current_user.record.id unless current_user.nil?
</code></pre>

<p>Thank you.</p>
","2988","","<p>Exceptions are just a specific example of a more general case of advanced non-local flow control constructs. Other examples are:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>notifications</em> (a generalization of exceptions, originally from some old Lisp object system, now implemented in e.g. CommonLisp and Ioke), </li>
<li><em>continuations</em> (a more structured form of <code>GOTO</code>, popular in high-level, higher-order languages), </li>
<li><em>coroutines</em> (a generalization of subroutines, popular especially in Lua), </li>
<li><em>generators</em> à la Python (essentially a restricted form of coroutines), </li>
<li><em>fibers</em> (cooperative light-weight threads) and of course the already mentioned </li>
<li><code>GOTO</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>(I'm sure there's many others I missed.)</p>

<p>An interesting property of these constructs is that they are all roughly equivalent in expressive power: if you have <em>one</em>, you can pretty easily build all the others.</p>

<p>So, how you best implement exceptions depends on what other constructs you have available: </p>

<ul>
<li>Every CPU has <code>GOTO</code>, therefore you can always fall back to that, if you must.</li>
<li>C has <code>setjmp</code>/<code>longjmp</code> which are basically MacGyver continuations (built out of duct-tape and toothpicks, not quite the real thing, but will at least get you out of the immediate trouble if you don't have something better available). </li>
<li>The JVM and CLI have exceptions of their own, which means that if the exception semantics of your language match Java's/C#'s, you are home free (but if not, then you are screwed). </li>
<li>The Parrot VM as both exceptions and continuations. </li>
<li>Windows has its own framework for exception handling, which language implementors can use to build their own exceptions on top.</li>
</ul>

<p>A very interesting use case, both of the <em>usage</em> of exceptions <em>and</em> the <em>implementation</em> of exceptions is Microsoft Live Lab's Volta Project. (Now defunct.) The goal of Volta was to provide architectural refactoring for Web applications at the push of a button. So, you could turn your one-tier web application into a two- or three-tier application just by putting some <code>[Browser]</code> or <code>[DB]</code> attributes on your .NET code and the code would then automagically run on the client or in the DB. In order to do that, the .NET code had to be translated to JavaScript source code, obviously.</p>

<p>Now, you <em>could</em> just write an entire VM in JavaScript and run the bytecode unmodified. (Basically, port the CLR from C++ to JavaScript.) There are actually projects that do this (e.g. the HotRuby VM), but this is both inefficient and not very interoperable with other JavaScript code.</p>

<p>So, instead, they wrote a compiler which compiles CIL bytecode to JavaScript sourcecode. However, JavaScript lacks certain features that .NET has (generators, threads, also the two exception models aren't 100% compatible), and more importantly it lacks certain features that compiler writers <em>love</em> (either <code>GOTO</code> or continuations) and that could be used to implement the above-mentioned missing features.</p>

<p>However, JavaScript <em>does</em> have exceptions. So, they used <em>JavaScript Exceptions</em> to implement <em>Volta Continuations</em> and then they used <em>Volta Continuations</em> to implement <em>.NET Exceptions</em>, <em>.NET Generators</em> and even <em>.NET Managed Threads</em>(!!!)</p>

<p>So, to answer your original question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How are exceptions implemented under the hood?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With Exceptions, ironically! At least in this very specific case, anyway.</p>

<p>Another great example is some of the exception proposals on the Go mailing list, which implement exceptions using Goroutines (something like a mixture of concurrent coroutines ans CSP processes). Yet another example is Haskell, which uses Monads, lazy evaluation, tail call optimization and higher-order functions to implement exceptions. Some modern CPUs also support basic building blocks for exceptions (for example the Vega-3 CPUs that were specifically designed for the Azul Systems Java Compute Accelerators).</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Not necessarily. <code>===</code> is a method, just like any other method. It does whatever I want it to do. And in some cases the ""is member of"" analogy breaks down. In this case it is already pretty hard to swallow. If you are a hardcore type theory freak, then viewing a type as a set and instances of that type as members of a set is totally natural. And of course for <code>Array</code> and <code>Hash</code> the definition of ""member"" is also obvious.</p>

<p>But what about <code>Regexp</code>? Again, if you are formal languages buff and know your Chomsky backwards, then interpreting a <code>Regexp</code> as an infinite set of words and <code>String</code>s as members of that set feels completely natural, but if not, then it sounds kind of weird.</p>

<p>So far, I have failed to come up with a concise description of <em>precisely</em> what <code>===</code> means. In fact, I haven't even come up with a good name for it. It is usually called the <em>triple equals operator</em>, <em>threequals operator</em> or <em>case equality operator</em>, but I strongly dislike those names, because it has absolutely nothing to do with equality.</p>

<p>So, what does it do? The best I have come up with is: imagine you are making a table, and one of the column headers is <code>Integer</code>. Would it make sense to write <code>3</code> in that column? If one of the column headers is <code>/ab*a/</code>, would it make sense to write <code>'abbbba'</code> in that column?</p>

<p>Based on that definition, it could be called the <em>subsumption operator</em>, but that's even worse than the other examples ...</p>

"<p>I've started to write a file format specification for a domain-specific data type. My goal is to improve interoperability between a large number of data providers and search algorithms. I want the result to be available for use, patent-free and without distribution fees.</p>

<p>I'm looking for advice on which license to use, both for the specification and for the contributor agreement, if I need one.</p>

<p>If this were software then I know enough about the GPL, MIT, etc. licenses to make an informed decision. If this were a straight document then I would pick one of the Creative Commons licenses, likely <a href=""http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/"" rel=""nofollow"">CC by attribution</a>.</p>

<p>Looking around, I don't find any common license statement or much in the way of advice. I'm leaning towards the one used in RFC (for example, the <a href=""http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec21.html#sec21"" rel=""nofollow"">HTTP/1.1 copyright statement</a>) but that says ""this document itself may not be modified in any way"" (with exceptions), which is something I'm not used to from developing code under the MIT and GPL licenses. But that restrictions seems pretty common in specifications.</p>

<p>Unlike most documents but like code, specifications can be affected by patent. Is it best practices these days to also state that the specification is patent-free and require any contributors to reveal any patent conflicts they may know of and/or freely license those patents for the purposes of implementing the spec?</p>

<p>Should I require some sort of contributor agreement?</p>

<p>Or should I just wing it, choose the RFC copyright statement (or CC-By-Attribution), and not worry about this?</p>
","2988","","<blockquote>
  <p>""this document itself may not be modified in any way"" (with exceptions) [...] But that restrictions seems pretty common in specifications.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually, it is pretty much a <em>requirement</em>. If anybody could change it at will, it wouldn't be much of a specification: that would defeat the whole <em>purpose</em> to ""improve interoperability between a large number of data providers and search algorithms"".</p>

<p>Dalke: Is it? I'm so used to implementation-defined and ad hoc format definitions and people who break the spec left and right that I didn't think it would add anything, and protection would hinder future extension if I decide to not continue maintaining the code. I thought conformance was better handled by trademark law, like how DRM-based CDs which violate Phillips' Red Book can't use the ""CD"" logo.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[...] which is something I'm not used to from developing code under the MIT and GPL licenses</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually, you <em>are</em> used to it, you just don't realize it: the whole reason why you were able to just write the three letters ""GPL"" above and blindly assume that everybody knows precisely what you mean, is because the GPL itself contains exactly that same restriction. (""<a href=""http://GNU.Org/licenses/gpl.html"" rel=""nofollow""><em>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</em></a>"") The GPL itself is not distributed under a Free License, precisely <em>because</em> if anybody where allowed to modify it, it would lose its meaning.</p>

<p>Dalke: You're right, although the GFDL's ""invariant section"" sprang immediately to mind when I was considering the possibilities. I will point out that people do things in the license grant which modify the terms of the GPL to, among other things, make it non-free, and I've personally modified the three-clause BSD license to scratch out Berkeley and put in my name, but those are quibbles.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is it best practices these days to also state that the specification is patent-free and require any contributors to reveal any patent conflicts they may know of and/or freely license those patents for the purposes of implementing the spec?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. It is clear from your question that you care a great deal about making the barrier for implementors as low as possible. Then, what good is a free, open, royalty-free specification if I have to pay for a patent license anyway? This <em>has</em> to be addressed, preferably by an IP/patent lawyer with extensive expertise in such questions (including, but not limited to, the specific challenges that open source projects face with regards to patent licensing).</p>

<p>There are some quite subtle pitfalls in there. For example, one common theme is to require that patent licenses be made available under what is usually called <a href=""http://Wikipedia.Org/wiki/Fair,_Reasonable_and_Non_Discriminatory_terms"" rel=""nofollow""><em>FRAND</em></a> (or <a href=""http://Wikipedia.Org/wiki/Reasonable_and_Non_Discriminatory_Licensing"" rel=""nofollow""><em>RAND</em></a>) terms, which stands for <em>fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory</em>. Which sounds good, right? Except there's a subtle problem there: charging 1 cent for every copy is certainly <em>reasonable</em> and if you charge everybody the same amount, it's also <em>fair</em> and <em>non-discriminatory</em>. Except that open source projects (and even freely distributable proprietary ones) <em>cannot</em> enforce those terms, therefore they cannot implement the specification.</p>

<p>Dalke: Very true. But for licenses that's a well described topic. There are reams of text on the matter, and suggestions, and podcasts, and even automated license choosers. For specifications, not so much. I did know about the RAND issue, and I've heard stories about other spec where a contributor at the end said ""Oh! Look at that! We've got a patent on it. Well lucky us!"" A question is how much I should worry about it.</p>

<p>So, <em>proper</em> patent promises or covenants or whatever you call them, are <em>very</em> important. (As are trademarks, by the way.)</p>

<p>For example, the W3C originally wanted to adopt a RAND license for its specifications, but after significant protests from projects such as Mozilla and Apache, they decided upon a royalty-free model. So, even an organization which cares deeply about freedom and openness <em>almost</em> made a mistake with the potential of killing every single open source web browser, feedreader and XML parser.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Or should I just wing it, choose the RFC copyright statement (or CC-By-Attribution), and not worry about this?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>""Winging"" important legal decisions is how people end up bankrupt or even in jail. Or at least extremely unhappy. While the first two are pretty unlikely in this case, I assume that you <em>will</em> be unhappy if you find out in two years that your specification is completely useless because of a glitch in its patent/copyright/IP legalese.</p>

<p>Dalke: I knew that word would be a draw. ;)</p>

<p>There are legal firms that specialize in pro bono work for non-profit developers of open source projects; maybe one of those will help you. The most well-known ones are probably the <a href=""http://SoftwareFreedom.Org/"" rel=""nofollow"">Software Freedom Law Center (SLFC)</a> in the US and the <a href=""http://ifrOSS.Org/"" rel=""nofollow"">Institut für Rechtsfragen der Freien und Open Source Software (ifrOSS)</a> in Germany.</p>

<p>And whaddaya know, the <a href=""http://ifrOSS.Org/ifross_html/home2_2009.html#ARTIKEL18"" rel=""nofollow"">fourth news item on the ifrOSS homepage</a> is about the <a href=""http://OpenWebFoundation.Org/legal/agreement/"" rel=""nofollow"">Open Web Foundation Agreement</a>, which is a license template by the <a href=""http://OpenWebFoundation.Org/"" rel=""nofollow"">Open Web Foundation</a> specifically <a href=""http://OpenWebFoundation.Org/legal/"" rel=""nofollow"">for  open, non-proprietary community-driven specifications for web technologies</a>.</p>

<p>Dalke: Thanks. I'm in Sweden, so I wonder how well those resources will apply to me. Looking at the  OWF I see it's US-based but it tries hard to be international, and I see one thing I don't like; the requirement for attribution. It does look like they are the people to talk to.

"<p>You can see all over the web people advising to not use git rebase in a public branch, but I can't see what's the problem if you always rebase a feature branch.</p>

<p>My team always use branchs for features (wow), we are used to have it just locally, so rebase isn't a problem, but sometimes we wanna show the code of a partially done feature to another developer, so we just publicize it, but then we lost all the advantages of git rebase, or at least that's what you can read at the web.</p>

<p>I don't understand what's the problem if the developers working at the same public branch never merge it to any branch (when there is still development on that branch) and when they pull it, they do it with a rebase operation. Any changes made to the branch will be always rebase on top of the remote branch, so never lost and you won't have the problem of having the same commit duplicated.</p>

<h3>Append 1:</h3>

<p>None of the answers until now showed the problems that will happen and how it will happen, so I will try to be clearer.</p>

<p>I will give an example of a workflow using rebase (badly described in the previously paragraphs, sorry) that I don't see any problem.</p>

<p>Initial state:</p>

<pre><code>master         ==========A
origin/feature           +=====AB
feature user A           +=====AB
feature user B           +=====AB
</code></pre>

<p>master get a few commits and user A does a few commits:</p>

<pre><code>master         ==========A=====C
origin/feature           +=====AB
feature user A           +=====AB====D
feature user B           +=====AB
</code></pre>

<p>User A does a ""git pull --rebase"" (he always does it) to update his branch, nothing new comes, then he rebase to master and push:</p>

<pre><code>master         ==========A=====C
origin/feature                 +=====ACB'=====ACB'D
feature user A                 +=====ACB'=====ACB'D
feature user B           +=====AB
</code></pre>

<p>(notice the B' is the new commits that still represents the changes B)</p>

<p>Then user B does a few commits:</p>

<pre><code>master         ==========A=====C
origin/feature                 +=====ACB'=====ACB'D
feature user A                 +=====ACB'=====ACB'D
feature user B           +=====AB======E
</code></pre>

<p>User B finally does a ""git pull --rebase"" as always, there is no need to rebase on master, so he just pushes:</p>

<pre><code>master         ==========A=====C
origin/feature                 +=====ACB'=====ACB'D======E'
feature user A                 +=====ACB'=====ACB'D
feature user B                 +=====ACB'=====ACB'D======E'
</code></pre>
","2988","","<p>If you rebase, you rewrite history. And just like in the real world, if you want to rewrite history, you need a conspiracy: everybody has to be ""in"" on the conspiracy (at least everybody who knows about the history, i.e. everybody who has ever pulled from the branch).</p>

<p>As long as the circle of people who pull from the branch is tightly controlled, it is fairly easy to get a conspiracy going, however, as soon as you publish that history, it becomes a <em>lot</em> harder. It's not impossible, though: the <code>pu</code> branch in Junio C Hamano's Git repository for example, gets rebased after every release, and that is a widely published repository. The way this works is that the fact that the branch will be frequently rebased and the times when that will happen, are widely documented on the Git website, the Git wiki and the Git mailinglist, and every rebase is announced on the mailinglist in advance so that people can prepare for it.</p>

<p>The two are <em>completely</em> unrelated. Somewhere higher up in your inheritance chain, you have a module method named <code>test</code> which takes at least one argument.

<pre><code>begin

<p>Even better yet, make sure that you are actually printing the <em>correct</em> missing dependency:</p>

rescue LoadError =&gt; e
  puts 'please install some_gem first!' if e.message =~ /some_gem/

  raise e.exception('please install some_gem first!') if e.message =~ /some_gem/

  raise unless e.message =~ /some_gem/
  friendly_ex = e.exception('please install some_gem first!')
  friendly_ex.set_backtrace(e.backtrace)
  raise friendly_ex
end

<p>Now you print pretty much the same thing that you would have printed with the <code>puts</code>, <em>but</em> you have a ""proper"" exception that for example allows better debugging or allows a consumer of your library to rescue <em>that</em> exception and handle it their way, both of which would have been impossible or at least hard with your solution that just swallows the exception.</p>

"<p>What's the difference between the <code>or</code> and <code>||</code> operators in Ruby? Or is it just preference?</p>
","2988","","<p>As the others have already explained, the <em>only</em> difference is the precedence. However, I would like to point out that there are actually <em>two</em> differences between the two:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>and</code>, <code>or</code> and <code>not</code> have <em>much</em> lower precedence than <code>&amp;&amp;</code>, <code>||</code> and <code>!</code></li>
<li><code>and</code> and <code>or</code> have the <em>same</em> precedence, while <code>&amp;&amp;</code> has <em>higher</em> precedence than <code>||</code></li>
</ol>

<p>In general, it is good style to avoid the use of <code>and</code>, <code>or</code> and <code>not</code> and use <code>&amp;&amp;</code>, <code>||</code> and <code>!</code> instead. (The Rails core developers, for example, reject patches which use the keyword forms instead of the operator forms.)</p>

<p>The reason why they exist at all, is not for boolean formulae but for control flow. They made their way into Ruby via Perl's well-known <code>do_this or do_that</code> idiom, where <code>do_this</code> returns <code>false</code> or <code>nil</code> if there is an error and <em>only then</em> is <code>do_that</code> executed instead. (Analogous, there is also the <code>do_this and then_do_that</code> idiom.)</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<pre><code>download_file_via_fast_connection or download_via_slow_connection
download_latest_currency_rates and store_them_in_the_cache
</code></pre>

<p>Sometimes, this can make control flow a little bit more fluent than using <code>if</code> or <code>unless</code>.</p>

<p>It's easy to see why in this case the operators have the ""wrong"" (i.e. identical) precedence: they never show up together in the same expression anyway. And when they <em>do</em> show up together, you generally <em>want</em> them to be evaluated simply left-to-right.</p>

"<p>Which <strike>interpreted languages</strike> pointer-free languages (IE: Python, Java, Perl, PHP, Ruby, Javascript, etc) have manual memory management? I don't recall ever hearing of one.</p>

<p>Isn't the major concern about interpreted languages the non-deterministic delays (or space complexity when there isn't enough delay) of garbage collection? So why not just write something exactly like Java, but forces you free memory manually?</p>

<p>EDIT</p>

<p>What I mean by manual memory management is that the language would have references to objects, and you can delete the object using a reference.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>Object a = new Object(); // a is a reference to the object
Object b = a; // b is a reference to the same object
a.method(); // fine

<p>So what caveats (Other than memory leaks) could there be in a language like this example?</p>
","2988","","<blockquote>
  <p>Which interpreted languages have manual memory management? I don't recall ever hearing of one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no such thing as an <em>interpreted language</em>. A language is neither compiled nor interpreted. A language just <em>is</em>. A language is a bunch of abstract mathematical rules. Interpretation or Compilation are traits of a language <em>implementation</em>, they have <em>nothing</em> to do with the language. <em>Every</em> language can be implemented by either a compiler or an interpreter; most modern high-performance language implementations actually use <em>both</em> and switch between them depending on which one is faster in a particular context.</p>

<p>Is C a compiled language? There are C interpreters out there. Is Python an interpreted language? All 8 current Python implementations use a compiler.</p>

<p>So, since <em>every</em> language can have an interpreted implementation, C and C++ are examples of interpreted languages with manual memory management. (And this is not just a theoretical hair-splitting contest, there <em>are</em> actually C and C++ interpreters out there. The VxWorks real-time operating system even contains one right in the kernel, and NASA once used this interpreter to fix a buggy kernel module on a spacecraft.)</p>

<p>Another example would be the very first version of Lisp from 1958: it had manual memory management (based on reference counting), but it was replaced only a couple of months later with a version with automatic memory management, which it has used ever since. Although again, <em>any</em> language can be implemented with either a compiler or an interpreter, so I don't know whether that version had an interpreted implementation or a compiled one. (In fact, I'm not sure whether it was implemented <em>at all</em>.)</p>

<p>If you relax your criteria a little bit and realize that memory management is only a special case of general resource management, then you will find that pretty much <em>all</em> languages, whether you want to call them compiled or interpreted or something else entirely, have some form of manual resource management for at least <em>some</em> kind of resource (file handles, database connections, network connections, caches, ...).</p>

"<p>The following statements represent my understanding of type systems (which suffers from too little hands-on experience outside the Java world); please correct any errors.</p>

<p>The static/dynamic distinction seems pretty clear-cut:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Statically typed</strong> langauges assign each variable, field and parameter a type and the compiler prevents assignments between incompatible types. Examples: C, Java, Pascal.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamically typed</strong> languages treat variables as generic bins that can hold anything you want - types are checked (if at all) only at runtime when you actually perform operations on the values, not when you assign them. Examples: Smalltalk, Python, JavaScript.</li>
<li><strong>Type inference</strong> allows statically typed languages to look like (and have some of the advantages of) dynamically typed ones, by inferring types from the context so that you don't have to declare them most of the time - but unlike in dynamic languages, you cannot e.g. use a variable to hold a string initially and then assign an integer to it. Examples: Haskell, Scala</li>
</ul>

<p>I am much less certain about the strong/weak distinction, and I suspect that it's not very clearly defined:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Strongly typed</strong> languages assign each runtime value a type and only allow operations to be performed that are defined for that type, otherwise there is an explicit type error.</li>
<li><strong>Weakly typed</strong> languages don't have runtime type checks - if you try to perform an operation on a value that it does not support, the results are unpredictable. It may actually do something useful, but more likely you'll get corrupted data, a crash, or some undecipherable secondary error.</li>
<li>There seems to be at least two different kinds of weakly typed languages (or perhaps a continuum):
<ul>
<li>In C and assembler, values are basically buckets of bits, so anything is possible and if you get the compiler to dereference the first 4 bytes of a null-terminated string, you better hope it leads somewhere that does not contain legal machine code.</li>
<li>PHP and JavaScript are also generally considered weakly typed, but do not consider values to be opaque bit buckets; they will, however, perform implicit type conversions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>But these implicit conversions seem to apply mainly to string/integer/float variables - does that really warrant the classification as weakly typed? Or are there other issues where these languages's type system may obfuscate errors?</li>
</ul>

<p>Luca Cardelli, in his <em>Typeful Programming</em> article, defines it as the absence of unchecked run-time type errors. Tony Hoare calls that <em>exact same</em> property ""security"". Other papers call it ""type safety"" or simply ""safety"".</p>

In this rant he states that within just a few hours of research, he was able to find 8 different, sometimes contradictory definitions, mostly from respected sources like college textbooks or peer-reviewed papers. In particular, those texts contained examples that were meant to help the students distinguish between strongly and weakly typed languages, and according to those examples, C is strongly typed, C is weakly typed, C++ is strongly typed, C++ is weakly typed, Lisp is strongly typed, Lisp is weakly typed, Perl is strongly typed, Perl is weakly typed.

<p>I'm a DBA and sysadmin, mostly for Windows machines running SQL Server. I'm looking for a programming/scripting language for Windows that doesn't require Admin access or an installer, needing no install process other than expanding it into a folder. My intent is to have a language for automation around which I can standardize.  </p>

<p>Up to this point, I've been using a combination of batch files and Unix shell, using sh.exe from <a href=""http://unxutils.sourceforge.net"">UnxUtils</a> but it's far from a perfect solution. </p>

<p>I've evaluated a handful of options, all of them have at least one serious shortcoming or another. I have a strong preference for something open source or dual license, but I'm more interested in finding the right tool than anything else. Not interested that anything that relies on Cygwin or Java, but at this point I'd be fine with something that needs .NET.</p>

<p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Manageable footprint (1-100 files, under 30 MB installed)</li>
<li>Run on Windows XP and Server (2003+)</li>
<li>No installer (exe, msi)</li>
<li>No reliance on a JVM or Cygwin install</li>
<li>Works with external pipes, processes, and files</li>
<li>Support for MS SQL Server or ODBC connections</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Bonus Points:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Open Source</li>
<li>FFI for calling functions in native DLLs</li>
<li>GUI support (native or gtk, wx, fltk, etc)</li>
<li>Linux, AIX, and/or OS X support</li>
<li>Dynamic, object oriented and/or functional, interpreted or bytecode compiled; interactive development</li>
<li>Able to package or compile scripts into executables</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>So far I've tried:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Ruby: 148 MB on disk, 23000 files</li>
<li>Portable Python: 54 MB on disk, 2800 files</li>
<li>Strawberry Perl: 123 MB on disk, 3600 files</li>
<li>REBOL: Great, except closed source and no MSSQL or ODBC in free version</li>
<li>Squeak Smalltalk: Great, except poor support for scripting </li>

"<p>In Perl, reference to anything is a simple scalar, and has the <code>$</code> sigil. It's sometimes hard to say what kind of reference it is. </p>

","2988","","<p>The purpose of Hungarian notation is to embed semantic annotations that </p>

<ul>
<li>cannot otherwise be expressed within the language, especially the type system AND</li>
<li>are not apparent from the context</li>
</ul>

<p>in the names of variables. Now, since Perl doesn't have a static type system, it might appear that Hungarian notation should be fairly common. But, take the canonical example for the value of Hungarian notation: tracking the origin of untrusted data.</p>

<p>One of the oft-cited examples for Hungarian notation is to prefix all string variables in an application with either <code>s</code> or <code>u</code> (for <em>safe</em> and <em>unsafe</em>), depending on whether the string came from a trusted source (or has been sanitized) or an untrusted one. But: just replace <em>unsafe</em> with <em>tainted</em> and you have a perfect description of tainting in Perl. So, in this case, even though Perl doesn't have a static type system, it has a <em>dynamic</em> type system that allows you to express the semantics of trusted/untrusted within the language and thus Hungarian notation is superfluous. (And even in a language without built-in support for tainting, there are usually much better ways, such as subtyping (Python, Ruby, Smalltalk, ...), annotations/attributes (Java, C#, ...), metadata (Clojure, ...) and static typing (Haskell, ML, ...).)</p>

<p>Also, Perl is pretty darn expressive, and thus it is much easier to keep the entire context for a variable in your head (or within one screenful of code), so, often enough the semantics are apparent from the surrounding code.</p>

<p>Good naming also helps, of course.</p>

<p>Remember: Hungarian notation was invented for C, which isn't expressive and has a static type system whose pretty much only use is as the punchline of a joke.</p>

","2988","","<p>As a general rule: you pretty much never need the ternary operator in Ruby. The reason why you need it in C, is because in C <code>if</code> is a statement, so if you want to return a value you <em>have</em> to use the ternary operator, which is an expression.</p>

<p>In Ruby, <em>everything</em> is an expression, there <em>are</em> no statements, which makes the ternary operator pretty much superfluous. You can always replace</p>

"<p>I've recently started programming in Ruby, and I am looking at exception handling.</p>

<p>I was wondering if <code>ensure</code> was the Ruby equivalent of <code>finally</code> in C#? Should I have:</p>

begin
  file &lt;&lt; ""#{content} \n""
rescue
  #handle the error here
ensure
  file.close unless file.nil?
end
</code></pre>

<p>or should I do this?</p>

<pre><code>#store the file
file = File.open(""myFile.txt"", ""w"")

begin
  file &lt;&lt; ""#{content} \n""
  file.close
rescue
  #handle the error here
ensure
  file.close unless file.nil?
end
</code></pre>

<p>Does <code>ensure</code> get called no matter what, even if an exception isn't raised?</p>
","2988","","<p>Yes, <code>ensure</code> ensures that the code is always evaluated. That's why it's called <code>ensure</code>. So, it is equivalent to Java's and C#'s <code>finally</code>.</p>

<p>The general flow of <code>begin</code>/<code>rescue</code>/<code>else</code>/<code>ensure</code>/<code>end</code> looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>begin
  # something which might raise an exception
rescue SomeExceptionClass =&gt; some_variable
  # code that deals with some exception
rescue SomeOtherException =&gt; some_other_variable
  # code that deals with some other exception
else
  # code that runs only if *no* exception was raised
ensure
  # ensure that this code always runs, no matter what
end
</code></pre>

<p>You can leave out <code>rescue</code>, <code>ensure</code> or <code>else</code>. You can also leave out the variables in which case you won't be able to inspect the exception in your exception handling code. (Well, you can always use the global exception variable to access the last exception that was raised, but that's a little bit hacky.) And you can leave out the exception class, in which case all exceptions that inherit from <code>StandardError</code> will be caught. (Please note that this does not mean that <em>all</em> exceptions are caught, because there are exceptions which are instances of <code>Exception</code> but not <code>StandardError</code>. Mostly very severe exceptions that compromise the integrity of the program such as <code>SystemStackError</code>, <code>NoMemoryError</code>, <code>SecurityError</code>, <code>NotImplementedError</code>, <code>LoadError</code>, <code>SyntaxError</code>, <code>ScriptError</code>, <code>Interrupt</code>, <code>SignalException</code> or <code>SystemExit</code>.)</p>

<p>Some blocks form implicit exception blocks. For example, method definitions are implicitly also exception blocks, so instead of writing</p>

<pre><code>def foo
  begin
    # ...
  rescue
    # ...
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>you write just</p>

<pre><code>def foo
  # ...
rescue
  # ...
end
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>def foo
  # ...
ensure
  # ...
end
</code></pre>

<p>The same applies to <code>class</code> definitions and <code>module</code> definitions.</p>

<p>However, in the specific case you are asking about, there is actually a much better idiom. In general, when you work with some resource which you need to clean up at the end, you do that by passing a block to a method which does all the cleanup for you. It's similar to a <code>using</code> block in C#, except that Ruby is actually powerful enough that you don't have to wait for the high priests of Microsoft to come down from the mountain and graciously change their compiler for you. In Ruby, you can just implement it yourself:</p>

<pre><code># This is what you want to do:
File.open('myFile.txt', 'w') do |file|
  file.puts content
end

# And this is how you might implement it:
def File.open(filename, mode='r', perm=nil, opt=nil)
  yield filehandle = new(path, mode, perm, opt)
ensure
  filehandle.close
end
</code></pre>

<p>And what do you know: this is <em>already</em> available in the core library as <code>File.open</code>. But it is a general pattern that you can use in your own code as well, for implementing any kind of resource cleanup (à la <code>using</code> in C#) or transactions or whatever else you might think of.</p>

<p>The only case where this doesn't work, if acquiring and releasing the resource are distributed over different parts of the program. But if it is localized, as in your example, then you can easily use these resource blocks.</p>

<hr>

<p>BTW: in modern C#, <code>using</code> is actually superfluous, because you can implement Ruby-style resource blocks yourself:</p>

<pre><code>class File
{
    static T open&lt;T&gt;(string filename, string mode, Func&lt;File, T&gt; block)
    {
        var handle = new File(filename, mode);
        try
        {
            return block(handle);
        }
        finally
        {
            handle.Dispose();
        }
    }
}

// Usage:

File.open(""myFile.txt"", ""w"", (file) =&gt;
{
    file.WriteLine(contents);
});

"<p>Is there an equivalent of the DLR (Dynamic Language Runtime for .NET) on the JVM? I'm aware that I could go about and implement my own dynamic bindings and emitting my own bytecode with Java. But is there any pre-built framework (like the DLR) so I don't have to re-invent the wheel?</p>
","2988","","<p>The DLR is several different things, some of which have direct equivalents in Java, some of which exist in different forms and some of which have no equivalent. Some of those which <em>do</em> have an equivalent are already part of the platform, some will be part of Java 7 and some are available from third parties.</p>

<h2>Runtime Binder and Caching Infrastructure</h2>

<p>The DLR has a runtime binding and caching infrastructure, which makes dynamic dispatch fast and efficient. How to make dynamic dispatch as fast as static dispatch and much faster than C++-style virtual table dispatch, has been known for more than 20 years, but most dynamic execution engines don't employ those technologies such as Polymorphic Inline Caching, Dynamic Type Inference, Type Feedback Optimization and so on. The DLR tries to provide a single implementation, which can be shared by all DLR-based languages (including the C# runtime binder used for the <code>dynamic</code> keyword in C# 4).</p>

<p>The Java equivalent to this is <a href=""http://JCP.Org/en/jsr/detail?id=292"">JSR-292</a>, which extends the JVM with a runtime binding and caching infrastructure. The main difference between the DLR and JSR-292 is that JSR-292 is implemented at the VM level, which means that in order to use it, you need a new VM. JSR-292 is going to be part of the next JVM specification, which in turn is going to be part of the Java 7 platform specification, but that is still a year or so away. (It is already available, in current <a href=""http://JDK7.Dev.Java.Net/"">JDK7 Early Access</a> releases, though, and has been for quite some time.)</p>

<p>The DLR, OTOH is just a library, and you can install it on the CLR 2.0, if you want to. Indeed, you don't even need the CLR, <em>any</em> CLI-compliant VES will do, such as Novell's <a href=""http://Mono-Project.Com/"">Mono</a>. And since the DLR is Open Source, Novell can just download the source code from the Microsoft website, and ship it as part of Mono, without writing a single of code ... which is exactly what they are doing. Sun's implementation of JSR-292 is also Open Source, but that doesn't help IBM, Oracle, Apache, RedHat, GNU and so on, because it is very VM-specific, so every JVM vendor has to implement it themselves. (And there is a <em>lot</em> of those, Sun <em>alone</em> has four different JVMs.)</p>

<p>[Note: there <em>is</em> a Rémi Forax's <a href=""http://JVM-Language-Runtime.GoogleCode.Com/"">JSR-292 backport</a>, which implements JSR-292 for older JVMs via bytecode rewriting. It is 100% compatible, but pretty slow.]</p>

<h2>Meta-Object Protocol for Interoperability</h2>

<p>The DLR contains a MOP (the <code>IDynamicObject</code> interface), which allows all DLR-based languages to interoperate with each other and with CLI-based languages on a much higher level and with much tighter integration than having to go through the CTS.</p>

<p>In the Java space, the equivalent is Attila Szegedi's (the maintainer of the Rhino JavaScript compiler for the JVM) <a href=""http://DynaLang.SourceForge.Net/"">dynalang</a> project, which is inspired by the CommonLisp MOP. It is however, </p>

<ul>
<li>not finished, </li>
<li>not widely used (yet) and</li>
<li>a third-party library, not part of the standard platform.</li>
</ul>

<p>All three of those are probably going to change sometime, but at least the last one is probably <em>not</em> going to happen for Java 7.</p>

<h2>Standardized Embedding API</h2>

<p>The DLR provides a standardized embedding API for DLR-based languages, which allows you to embed a language runtime in your application without having to learn a different API for every different runtime. Indeed, you don't even have to <em>know</em> what the runtime is!</p>

<p>The equivalent to this is the JSR-223 Java Scripting API which has been part of the Java platform since Java 6 and lives in the <a href=""http://Java.Sun.Com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/script/package-summary.html""><code>javax.script</code> package</a>.</p>

<h2>Code Representation and Compiler</h2>

<p>The DLR contains a standard representation for code (DLR trees, Expression trees) and both an interpreter and a highly optimizing compiler for those trees, which allows langage implementors to concentrate on their language-specific compiler frontends and have the DLR deal with the nitty-gritty of code generation behind the scenes.</p>

<p>There is no equivalent in Java.</p>

<h2>Dynamic capabilities for static languages</h2>

<p>C# 4 and VB.NET 10 add dynamic typing for easier integration with dynamic languages. While this has technically nothing to do with the DLR, it uses the DLR for some of its work.</p>

<p>There is no equivalent in Java.</p>

"<p>I have doubt whether we can achieve multiple inheritence using 'module' concept or Is there any other keywords or concepts which achieve multiple inheritence in ruby?</p>

"<p>I've been looking at the source code of a few gems lately. One idiom that I keep seeing is the use of a nested module containing version constants that are joined into a version string i.e. variations around this sort of thing:</p>

<pre><code>module ChunkyBacon
  module Version
    MAJOR = 0
    MINOR = 6
    TINY  = 2
  end

  VERSION = [Version::MAJOR, Version::MINOR, Version::TINY].compact * '.'
end
</code></pre>

<p>What's the advantage (if any) of storing the library version information in this way? Why not just do:</p>

<pre><code>module ChunkyBacon
  VERSION = '0.6.2'.freeze
end
</code></pre>
","2988","","<p>Having version information in a string is generally a bad idea.</p>

<p>For example, there can <em>never</em> be a Ruby 1.10, because too many applications which test for compatibility using <code>if RUBY_VERSION &gt; '1.6'</code> would break. (Because lexicographically, <code>1.10 &lt; 1.6</code>) That's why there is this complicated scheme where what <em>would</em> normally have been Ruby 1.9.x was instead Ruby 1.9.0-x and what <em>would</em> have been Ruby 1.10.x is now Ruby 1.9.x+1. So, the upcoming version of Ruby, which is Ruby 1.9.2, and which <em>looks</em> like it were an unstable development version, is <em>really</em> Ruby 1.10.1, which is a production version.</p>

<p>This leads to a lot of confusion. For example, even many seasoned Ruby community leaders, are still spreading the misinformation that Ruby 1.9 is a development version, <em>despite</em> the fact that the change in versioning policy has been widely communicated.</p>

<p>The Opera web browser is another example. When Opera 10.0 was released, it originally reported its version number as, well, 10.0. However, during the betatest it became clear that many websites, among them very big and well-respected ones, completely broke, because Opera was the first-ever mainstream browser to hit 10.0, and those websites were doing simple string compare and thus thought they were dealing with Opera 1.0, which doesn't support JavaScript or CSS. The <em>only</em> workable solution was that the final release of Opera 10.0 prints 9.80 as the version number.</p>

<p>Mark Russinovich also had a great rant about comparing version numbers during his presentation about the Windows 7 kernel at Microsoft PDC. He was explaining to the audience why the version number of Windows 7, which used to be 7 in the early builds, was 6.1 in the release. The reason is that a lot of applications either degraded or failed to work at all. Some would simply check for <code>if major == 6 then enhanced_vista_mode else crappy_xp_mode</code> which means they would run degraded in Windows 7. Others were even more aggressive and had something like <code>if major == 6 then enhanced_vista_mode elsif major == 5 then crappy_xp_mode else unsupported_windows_version</code> and they would refuse to work at all. (Which is of course stupid since Windows 7 is completely backwards compatible with Vista.)</p>

<p>So, Microsoft changed the version number to 6.1, and Russinovich said, half joking, half sad and serious, that this obviously means that the version number for Windows 8 would have to be 6.1.1. and so on.</p>

<p>So, to make a long story short: programmers are too stupid to parse version numbers themselves, you <em>must</em> do it for them.</p>

","2988","","<p>Everybody and his dog calls <code>File.open</code>. I could imagine a ton of reasons why it would called: RSpec reading its config file, Rails reading its config file(s), Cucumber reading its config file, the debugger creating a temporary file, something else creating a temporary file and so on.</p>

<p>You should check <em>who</em> is calling <code>File.open</code>, <em>where</em> that call happens, <em>what</em> the arguments are and <em>why</em> that is happening.</p>

<p>But, this is something you will just have to deal with, when setting expectations on core methods.</p>

<p>Imagine, for example, you are running your specs on Rubinius. In Rubinius, the compiler is written in Ruby. It doesn't currently cache its compiled results, but it is certainly conceivable that it <em>could</em> cache them, and then it would naturally use <code>File.open</code>. Bam! Now your specs randomly break depending on whether you hit the JIT threshold or not.</p>

<p>Or, even worse: all of Rubinius uses arrays and symbols extensively to implement just about everything. Try setting some expectations on <em>those</em>!</p>

"<p>Are dynamic languages slower than static languages because, for example, the run-time has to check the type consistently?</p>
","2988","","<p>No.</p>

<p>Dynamic languages are not slower than static languages. In fact, it is impossible for <em>any</em> language, dynamic or not, to be slower than another language (or faster, for that matter), simply because a language is just a bunch of abstract mathematical rules. You cannot <em>execute</em> a bunch of abstract mathematical rules, therefore they cannot ever be slow(er) or fast(er).</p>

<p>The statement that ""dynamic languages are slower than static languages"" is not only <em>wrong</em>, it doesn't even make <em>sense</em>. If English were a typed language, that statement wouldn't even typecheck.</p>

<p>In order for a language to even be able to <em>run</em>, it has to be <em>implemented</em> first. <em>Now</em> you can measure performance, <em>but</em> you aren't measuring the performance of the <em>language</em>, you are measuring the performance of the <em>execution engine</em>. Most languages have many different execution engines, with very different performance characteristics. For C, for example, the difference between the fastest and slowest implementations is a factor of 100000 or so!</p>

<p>Also, you cannot <em>really</em> measure the performance of an execution engine, either: you have to write some code to <em>run</em> on that exection engine first. But now you aren't measuring the performance of the execution engine, you are measuring the performance of the <em>benchmark code</em>. Which has very little to do with the performance of the execution engine and <em>certainly</em> nothing to do with the performance of the <em>language</em>.</p>

<p>In general, running well-designed code on well-designed high-performance execution engines will yield about the same performance, independent of whether the language is static or dynamic, procedural, object-oriented or functional, imperative or declarative, lazy or strict, pure or impure.</p>

<p>In fact, I would propose that the performance of a system is solely dependent on the amount of money that was spent making it fast, and completely independent of any particular typing discipline, programming paradigm or language.</p>

<p>Take for example Smalltalk, Lisp, Java and C++. All of them are, or have at one point been, <em>the</em> language of choice for high-performance code. All of them have <em>huge</em> amounts of engineering and research man-centuries expended on them to make them fast. All of them have highly-tuned proprietary commercial high-performance execution engines available. Given roughly the same problem, implemented by roughly comparable developers, they all perform roughly the same.</p>

<p>Two of those languages are dynamic, two are static. Java is interesting, because although it is a static language, most modern high-performance implementations are actually <em>dynamic</em> implementations. (In fact, several modern high-performance JVMs are actually either Smalltalk VMs in disguise, derived from Smalltalk VMs or written by Smalltalk VM companies.) Lisp is also interesting, because although it is a dynamic language, there are some (although not many) static high-performance implementations.</p>

<p>And we haven't even begun talking about the <em>rest</em> of the execution environment: modern mainstream operating systems, mainstream CPUs and mainstream hardware architectures are heavily biased towards static languages, to the point of being actively hostile for dynamic languages. Given that modern mainstream execution environments are pretty much of a worst-case scenario for dynamic languages, it is quite astonishing how well they actually perform and one can only imagine what the performance in a less hostile environment would look like.</p>

"<p>please some1 tell me the difference between a 'static variable' and a 'dynamic variable' in oops or in java. Also their usage if possible.</p>

"<p>I would like to do some fairly heavy-duty reflection in the Ruby programming language. I would like to create a function which would return the names of the arguments of various calling functions higher up the call stack (just one higher would be enough but why stop there?). I could use Kernel.caller go to the file and parse the argument list but that would be ugly and unreliable. </p>

<p>The function that I would like would work in the following way:</p>

<pre><code>module A
  def method1( tuti, fruity) 
    foo
  end
  def method2(bim, bam, boom)  
    foo
  end
  def foo
    print caller_args[1].join("","") #the ""1"" mean one step up the call stack
  end

end

A.method1
 #prints ""tuti,fruity""
A.method2
 #prints ""bim, bam, boom""

<p>I would not mind using <a href=""http://rubyforge.org/projects/parsetree/"">ParseTree</a> or some similar tool for this task but looking at Parsetree, it is not obvious how to use it for this purpose. Creating a C extension like <a href=""http://eigenclass.org/hiki/ruby%2Bbacktrace%2Bdata"">this</a> is another possibility but it would be nice if someone had already done it for me.</p>

<p>Edit2: I can see that I'll probably need some kind of C extension. I suppose that means my question is what combination of C extension would work most easily. I don't think caller+ParseTree would be enough by themselves. </p>

<p>As far as why I would like to do this goes, rather than saying ""automatic debugging"", perhaps I should say that I would like to use this functionality to do automatic checking of the calling and return conditions of functions. Say </p>

<pre><code>def add x, y 
  check_positive
  return x + y
end
</code></pre>

<p>Where check_positive would throw an exception if x and y weren't positive (obviously, there would be more to it than that but hopefully this gives enough motivation)</p>

","2988","","<p>There is no such thing as a <em>REST URL</em>. In fact, the word <em>REST URL</em> is pretty much an oxymoron.

"<p>Taking an example of Fibonacci Series from the Clojure Wiki, the Clojure code is :</p>

<pre><code>(def fib-seq
 (lazy-cat [0 1] (map + (rest fib-seq) fib-seq)))
</code></pre>

<p>If you were to think about this starting from the [0 1], how does it work ? Would be great if there are suggestions on the thought process that goes into thinking in these terms.</p>
","2988","","<p>My Clojure is a bit rusty, but this seems to be a literal translation of the famous Haskell one-liner:</p>

<pre><code>fibs = 0 : 1 : zipWith (+) fibs (tail fibs)
</code></pre>

<p>[I'm going to be using pseudo-Haskell, because it's a little bit more succinct.]</p>

<p>The first thing you need to do, is simply let laziness sink in. When you look at a definition like this:</p>

<pre><code>zeroes = 0 : zeroes
</code></pre>

<p>Your immediate gut reaction as a strict programmer would be ""ZOMG infinite loop! Must fix bug!"" But it isn't an infinite loop. This is a <em>lazy</em> infinite loop. If you do something stupid like</p>

<pre><code>print zeroes
</code></pre>

<p>Then, yes, there <em>will</em> be an infinite loop. But as long as you simply use a finite number of elements, you will never notice that the recursion doesn't actually terminate. This is <em>really</em> hard to get. I still don't.</p>

<p>Laziness is like the monetary system: it's based on the assumption that the vast majority of people never use the vast majority of their money. So, when <em>you</em> put $1000 in the bank, they don't keep it in their safe. They lend it to someone else. Actually, they <em>leverage</em> the money, which means that they lend $5000 to someone else. They only ever need enough money so that they can quickly reshuffle it so that it's <em>there</em> when you are looking at it, giving you the <em>appearance</em> that they actually keep your money.</p>

<p>As long as they can manage to always give out money when you walk up to an ATM, it doesn't actually matter that the vast majority of your money isn't there: they only need the small amount you are withdrawing at the point in time when you are making your withdrawal.</p>

<p>Laziness works the same: whenever you look at it, the value is there. If you look at the first, tenth, hundreth, quadrillionth element of <code>zeroes</code>, it <em>will</em> be there. But it will <em>only</em> be there, <em>if</em> and <em>when</em> you look at it, <em>not</em> before.</p>

<p>That's why this inifintely recursive definition of <code>zeroes</code> works: as long as you don't try to look at the <em>last</em> element (or <em>every</em> element) of an infinite list, you are safe.</p>

<p>Next step is <code>zipWith</code>. (Clojure's <code>map</code> is just a generalization of what in other programming languages are usually three different functions: <code>map</code>, <code>zip</code> and <code>zipWith</code>. In this example, it is used as <code>zipWith</code>.)</p>

<p>The reason why the <code>zip</code> family of functions is named that way, is because it actually works like a zipper, and that is also how to best visualize it. Say we have some sporting event, where every contestant gets two tries, and the score from both tries is added up to give the end result. If we have two sequences, <code>run1</code> and <code>run2</code> with the scores from each run, we can calculate the end result like so:</p>

<pre><code>res = zipWith (+) run1 run2
</code></pre>

<p>Assuming our two lists are <code>(3 1 6 8 6)</code> and <code>(4 6 7 1 3)</code>, we line both of those lists up side by side, like the two halves of a zipper, and then we zip them together using our given function (<code>+</code> in this case) to yield a new sequence:</p>

<pre><code>3   1   6   8   6
+   +   +   +   +
4   6   7   1   3
=   =   =   =   =
7   7  13   9   9
</code></pre>

<p>Contestant #3 wins.</p>

<p>So, what does our <code>fib</code> look like?</p>

<p>Well, it starts out with a <code>0</code>, then we append a <code>1</code>, then we append the sum of the infinite list with the infinite list shifted by one element. It's easiest to just draw that out:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>the first element is zero:</p>

<pre><code>0
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>the second element is one:</p>

<pre><code>0   1
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>the third element is the first element plus the first element of the rest (i.e. the second element). We visualize this again like a zipper, by putting the two lists on top of each other.</p>

<pre><code>0   1
+
1
=
1
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Now, the element that we just computed is not just the <em>output</em> of the <code>zipWith</code> function, it is at the same time also the <em>input</em>, as it gets appended to both lists (which are actually the same list, just shifted by one):</p>

<pre><code>0   1   1
+   +
1   1
=   =
1   2
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>and so forth:</p>

<pre><code>0   1   1   2
+   +   +
1   1   2
=   =   =
1   2   3


0   1   1   2   3   ^
+   +   +   +       |
1   1   2   3   ^   |
=   =   =   =   |   |
1   2   3   5---+---+
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>Or if you draw it a little bit differently and merge the result list and the second input list (which really are the same, anyway) into one:</p>

<pre><code>0   1   1   2   3   ^
+   +   +   +   +   |
1 = 1 = 2 = 3 = 5---+

"<p>I know a lot of Java people have started looking at Scala since it runs on the JVM, and a lot of people in the Microsoft world are looking at F#, but what does Ruby have as a natural functional successor?</p>

<p>In a pure FP sense Ruby doesn't lack anything, instead it has too much some may say. A functional language forces the programmer to not use global variables and other idioms so much (although it is possible to use globals in functional languages)</p>
","2988","","<p>There's two <em>very</em> different definitions of what ""functional programming"" means. You can kind-of do the one in Ruby, but you cannot do the other.</p>

<p>Those two definitions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>programming with first-class functions and </li>
<li>programming with mathematical functions</li>
</ul>

<p>You can kind-of program with first-class functions in Ruby. It has support for first-class functions. In fact, it has <em>too much</em> support for them: there is <code>Proc.new</code>, <code>proc</code>, <code>lambda</code>, <code>Method</code>, <code>UnboundMethod</code>, blocks, <code>#to_proc</code> and <code>-&gt;()</code> (and probably some others that I forget).</p>

<p>All of these <a href=""http://Innig.Net/software/ruby/closures-in-ruby.rb"">behave slightly differently</a>, have slightly different syntax, slightly different behavior and slightly different restrictions. For example: the only one of these which is syntactically lightweight enough that you can actually use it densely, is blocks. But blocks have some rather severe restrictions: you can only pass one block to a method, blocks aren't objects (which in an object-oriented language in wich ""everything is an object"" is a <em>very</em> severe restriction) and at least in Ruby 1.8 there are also some restrictions w.r.t parameters.</p>

<p>Referring to a method is another thing that is fairly awkward. In <a href=""http://Python.Org/"">Python</a> or <a href=""http://ECMAScript.Org/"">ECMAScript</a> for example, I can just say <code>baz = foo.bar</code> to refer to the <code>bar</code> method of the <code>foo</code> object. In Ruby, <code>foo.bar</code> is a method <em>call</em>, if I want to refer to the <code>bar</code> method of <code>foo</code>, I have to say <code>baz = foo.method(:bar)</code>. And if I now want to <em>call</em> that method, I cannot just say <code>baz()</code>, I have to say <code>baz.call</code> or <code>baz[]</code> or (in Ruby 1.9) <code>baz.()</code>.</p>

<p>So, first-class functions in Ruby aren't <em>really</em> first-class. They are much better than second-class, and they are <em>good enough</em>&trade;, but they aren't fully first-class.</p>

<p>But generally, Rubyists do not leave Ruby just for first-class functions. Ruby's support is good enough that any advantages you might gain from better support in another language usually is eaten up by the training effort for the new language or by something <em>else</em> that you are accustomed to that you must now give up. Like, say RubyGems or tight Unix integration or Ruby on Rails or syntax or &hellip;</p>

<p>However, the <em>second</em> definition of FP is where Ruby falls flat on its face. If you want to do programming with mathematical functions in Ruby, you are in for a world of pain. You cannot use the absolute majority of Ruby libraries, because most of them are stateful, effectful, encourage mutation or are otherwise impure. You cannot use the standard library for the same reasons. You cannot use the core library. You cannot use any of the core datatypes, because they are all mutable. You could just say ""I don't care that they are mutable, I will simply not mutate them and always copy them"", but the problem is: someone else still can mutate them. Also, because they are mutable, Ruby cannot optimize the copying and the garbage collector isn't tuned for that kind of workload.</p>

<p>It just doesn't work.</p>

<p>There is also a couple of features that have really nothing to do with functional programming but that most functional languages tend to have, that Ruby is missing. Pattern matching, for example. Laziness also was not that easy to achieve before <code>Enumerator</code>s were more aggressively used in Ruby 1.9. And there's still some stuff that works with strict <code>Enumerable</code>s or <code>Array</code>s but not with lazy <code>Enumerator</code>s, although there's actually no reason for them to <em>require</em> strictness.</p>

<p>And for <em>this</em> definition of FP, it definitely makes sense to leave Ruby behind.</p>

<p>The two main languages that Rubyists have been flocking to, are <a href=""http://Erlang.Org/"">Erlang</a> and <a href=""http://Clojure.Org/"">Clojure</a>. These are both relatively good matches for Ruby, because they are both dynamically typed, have a similar REPL culture as Ruby, and (this is more a Rails thing than a Ruby thing) are also very good on the web. They have still pretty small and welcoming communities, the original language creators are still active in the community, there is a strong focus on doing new, exciting and edgy things, all of which are traits that the Ruby community also has.</p>

<p>The interest in Erlang started, when someone showed the original 1993 introduction video ""<a href=""http://Archive.Org/details/ErlangTheMovie/"">Erlang: The Movie</a>"" at RubyConf 2006. A couple of high-profile Rails projects started using Erlang, for example <a href=""http://Powerset.Com/"">PowerSet</a> and <a href=""https://GitHub.Com/"">GitHub</a>. Erlang is also easy to master for Rubyists, because it doesn't take purity quite as far as <a href=""http://Haskell.Org/"">Haskell</a> or <a href=""http://Clean.CS.RU.Nl/"">Clean</a>. The <em>inside</em> of an actor is pretty pure, but the act of sending messages itself is of course a side-effect. Another thing that makes Erlang easy to grasp, is that Actors and Objects are actually the same thing, when you follow <a href=""http://Lists.SqueakFoundation.Org/pipermail/squeak-dev/1998-October/017019.html"">Alan Kay's definition of object-oriented programming</a>.</p>

<p>Clojure has been a recent addition to the Rubyist's toolbelt. Its popularity is I guess mostly driven by the fact that the Ruby community has finally warmed up to the idea that JVM ≠ Java and embraced <a href=""http://JRuby.Org/"">JRuby</a> and then they started to look around what <em>other</em> interesting stuff there was on the JVM. And again, Clojure is much more pragmatic than both other functional languages like Haskell and other Lisps like <a href=""http://Scheme-Reports.Org/"">Scheme</a> and much simpler and more modern than CommonLisp, so it is a natural fit for Rubyists.</p>

<p>Another cool thing about Clojure is that because both Clojure and Ruby run on the JVM, you can <em>combine</em> them.</p>

<p>The author of ""<a href=""http://PragProg.Com/titles/shcloj/programming-clojure/"">Programming Clojure</a>"" (Stuart Halloway) is a (former?) Rubyist, for example, as is <a href=""http://Technomancy.us/"">Phil Hagelberg</a>, the author of the <a href=""https://GitHub.Com/Technomancy/Leiningen/"">Leiningen</a> build tool for Clojure.</p>

<p>However, Rubyists are also looking at both <a href=""http://Scala-Lang.Org/"">Scala</a> (as one of the more pragmatic statically typed FP languages) and Haskell (as one of the more elegant ones). Then there is projects like <a href=""https://GitHub.Com/MCamou/Scuby/"">Scuby</a> and <a href=""https://GitHub.Com/MWotton/Hubris/"">Hubris</a> which are bridges that let you integrate Ruby with Scala and Haskell, respectively. Twitter's decision to move part of their low-level messaging infrastructure first from MySQL to Ruby, then from Ruby to Scala is also pretty widely known.</p>

<p><a href=""http://FSharp.Net/"">F#</a> doesn't seem to play any role at all, possibly due to an irrational fear towards all things Microsoft the Ruby community has. (Which, BTW, seems mostly unfounded, given that the F# team has <em>always</em> made versions available for Mono.)</p>

"<p>I think I have my brain halfway wrapped around the Dynamic Types concept in C# 4, but can't for the life of me figure out a scenario where I'd actually want to use it.</p>

<p>I'm sure there are many, but I'm just having trouble making the connection as to how I could engineer a solution that is better solved with dynamics as opposed to interfaces, dependency injection, etc.</p>

<p>So, what's a real-world application scenario where dynamic type usage is appropriate?</p>
","2988","","<p>There are lots of cases where you are <em>already</em> using dynamic typing and dynamic binding <em>today</em>. You just don't realize it, because it is all hidden behind strings or <code>System.Object</code>, since until C# 4, the necessary support wasn't there.</p>

<p>One example is COM interop: COM is actually a semi-dynamic object system. When you do COM interop, a lot of methods actually return a dynamic object, but because C# didn't support them, they were returned as <code>System.Object</code> and you had to cast them yourself, possibly catching exceptions on the way.</p>

<p>Another example is interacting with dynamically typed (or even untyped) data, such as JSON, CSV, HTML, schemaless XML, schemaless web services, schemaless databases (which are, after all, the new hotness). Today, you use strings for those. An XML API would look like</p>

<pre><code>var doc = new XmlDocument(""/path/to/file.xml"");
var baz = doc.GetElement(""foo"").GetElement(""qux"");
</code></pre>

<p>and so on. But how about:</p>

<pre><code>dynamic doc = new XmlDocument(""/path/to/file.xml"");
var baz = doc.foo.qux;
</code></pre>

<p>Doesn't that look nice?</p>

<p>A third example is reflection. Today, invocation of a method via reflection is done by passing a string to <code>InvokeMember</code> (or whatever the thing is called). Wouldn't it be nicer to, you know, just invoke the damn thing?</p>

<p>Then, there is <em>generation</em> of dynamic data (basically the opposite of the second example). Here's an example how to generate some dynamic XML:</p>

<pre><code>dynamic doc = new XmlBuilder();
doc.articles(id=42, type=""List"", () =&gt; {
  article(() =&gt; {
    number(42);
    title(""blahblubb"");});});
</code></pre>

<p>This is not nearly as beautiful as the equivalent Ruby, but it is the best I could come up with at such short notice :-)</p>

<p>And last but certainly not least, integration with a dynamically typed language. Whether that is JavaScript in a Silverlight application, a custom rules engine embedded in your business app or a DLR instance that you host in your CAD program/IDE/text editor.</p>

"<p>I have an html file that I need to take any  tag and put an align='left' into it.</p>

<p>If it already specifies an alignment I need it to just leave this. So given the line :</p>

"<p>Most things that look like operators are methods in Ruby; <code>1 + 2</code> is syntactic sugar for <code>1.+(2)</code>.</p>

<p>Even though <code>+</code> and <code>*</code> are methods that a program can redefine, Ruby has special magic to evaluate <code>1 + 2 * 3</code> as <code>1.+(2.*(3))</code> instead of <code>1.+(2).*(3)</code>.</p>

<p>I wonder where this special magic lives in Ruby--if it is hard-wired into the interpreter.</p>

<p>Ari.</p>
","2988","","<p>In all Ruby Implementations, Operator Precedence is handled by the parser. Since pretty much all existing Ruby Implementations use the same parser, or a parser generated from the same YACC grammar, <a href=""https://GitHub.Com/Shyouhei/Ruby/blob/trunk/parse.y#L741-767""><code>parse.y</code> in YARV is the file you want to look at</a>. (In JRuby, for example, that file is essentially the same: <a href=""https://GitHub.Com/JRuby/JRuby/blob/master/src/org/jruby/parser/Ruby19Parser.y#L244-270""><code>src/org/jruby/parser/Ruby19Parser.y</code></a>. Same for IronRuby: <a href=""https://GitHub.Com/IronRuby/IronRuby/blob/master/Merlin/Main/Languages/Ruby/Ruby/Compiler/Parser/Parser.y#L131-152""><code>Merlin/Main/Languages/Ruby/Ruby/Compiler/Parser/Parser.y</code></a>.)</p>

<p>The only four Ruby Implementations that do <em>not</em> either use the YARV parser directly or use a YACC clone generated parser from YARV's <code>parse.y</code>, are Cardinal, tinyrb, RubyGoLightly and XRuby.</p>

<p>Cardinal is a Ruby implementation for the Parrot virtual machine, and since Parrot includes the Parrot Grammar Engine, Cardinal naturally uses that. The interesting file is <a href=""https://GitHub.Com/Cardinal/Cardinal/blob/master/src/parser/grammar.pg#L446-542""><code>src/parser/grammar.pg</code></a>. PGE is a hybrid recursive-descent parser/operator precedence parser, which means that operator precedence shows up pretty nicely in the grammar file.</p>

<p>Tinyrb uses a PEG parser utilizing Ian Piumarta's leg library. As is typical for PEG parsers, there is no operator precedence table, rather the precedence is implicit in the hierarchical structure of the grammar. See <a href=""https://GitHub.Com/MACournoyer/TinyRb/blob/master/vm/grammar.leg#L94-106""><code>vm/grammar.leg</code></a> for details. RubyGoLightly is derived from tinyrb, except it uses Go instead of C as the implementation language, but it uses the same PEG grammar.</p>

<p>XRuby uses ANTLR for its parser. Here, the interesting file is <a href=""https://GitHub.Com/RhoMobile/Rhodes/blob/1-4-unstable/platform/shared/xruby/src/com/xruby/compiler/parser/ruby.g#L262-525""><code>src/com/xruby/compiler/parser/ruby.g</code></a>.</p>

<p>Rubinius uses the Melbourne parser, which is essentially YARV's parser packaged as a C extension. MagLev uses <code>ruby_parser</code> (see below).</p>

<p>Apart from the Ruby Implementations, there are also other Ruby parsers available.</p>

<p>Ryan Davis's ruby_parser is derived from the YARV YACC grammar. It uses racc as the parser generator. See <a href=""https://GitHub.Com/SeattleRb/Ruby_Parser/blob/master/lib/ruby_parser.y#L21-44""><code>lib/ruby_parser.y</code></a>.</p>

<p>Caleb Clausen's RedParse uses Caleb's own hand-written compiler-interpreter. The interesting file is <a href=""https://GitHub.Com/Coatl/RedParse/blob/master/lib/redparse/babyparser.rb#L26-91""><code>lib/redparse/babyparser.rb</code></a>.</p>

<p>That's all the parsers I know, that actually handle operator precedence. There is another parser built into RDoc, and there used to be one in YARD (it now uses RedParse), but those only handle just enough of Ruby's syntax to find modules, classes and methods, comments and extract method parameter lists. They don't deal with operator precedence.</p>

<p>The answer is: all of those, any of those, either of those or neither of those, depending on the context. Therefore, you have to tell Ruby which of those you actually want.</p>

<p>There are several methods in the <code>String</code> class which return enumerators for any of the above. If you want the pre-1.9 behavior, your code sample would be</p>

<pre><code>'im a string meing!'.bytes.to_a.pop

<p>This looks kind of ugly, but there is a reason for it: a string is a sequence. You are treating it as a stack. A stack is not a sequence, in fact it pretty much is the <em>opposite</em> of a sequence.</p>

<p>Sometimes it's useful to assign numerous of a constructed arguments to instance variables on construction. Other than the obvious method:</p>

<pre><code>def initialize(arg1, arg2, arg3)
  @arg1, @arg2, @arg3 = arg1, arg2, arg3
end

<p>Is there a more concise idiom for achieving the same result? Something like that found in scala for instance:</p>

<pre><code>class FancyGreeter(greeting: String) {
  def greet() = println(greeting)
}
</code></pre>

<p>Where in this case the object FancyGreeter has a default constructor that provides assignment for it's passed arguments.</p>
","2988","","<p>In Ruby 1.8, block arguments and method arguments have different semantics: method arguments have <em>binding semantics</em>, block arguments have <em>assignment semantics</em>.</p>

<p>What that means is that when you call a method, the method arguments get <em>bound</em> to the values that you pass in. When you call a block, the values get <em>assigned</em> to the arguments.</p>

<p>So, you can create some pretty crazy looking blocks that way, that seemingly don't do anything:</p>

<pre><code>lambda {|@a|}.call(42)
</code></pre>

<p>The block body is empty, but because of the argument assignment semantics, the instance variable <code>@a</code> will be assigned the value <code>42</code>. It works even crazier:</p>

<pre><code>lambda {|foo.bar|}.call(42)
</code></pre>

<p>Yes, <code>attr_writer</code> methods work too. Or what about </p>

<pre><code>foo = {}
lambda {|foo[:bar]|}.call(42)
p foo # =&gt; {:bar =&gt; 42}
</code></pre>

<p>Yup, those too.</p>

<p>And since you can define methods using blocks, you can do this: </p>

<pre><code>class FancyGreeter
  define_method(:initialize) {|@greeting|}
  def greet; puts @greeting end
end
</code></pre>

<p>or even </p>

<pre><code>class FancyGreeter
  attr_accessor :greeting
  define_method(:initialize) {|self.greeting|}
  def greet; puts greeting end
end
</code></pre>

<p>However, I wouldn't recommend this for two reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Not many Rubyists know this, be kind to the people who have to maintain the code after you.</li>
<li>In Ruby 1.9 and onwards, block argument semantics are gone, blocks also use method argument semantics, therefore this does no longer work.</li>

<p>Much better, isn't it?</p>

<pre><code>return control;
</code></pre>

<p>I personally like to reserve the <code>return</code> keyword for ""pure"" methods (i.e. methods that don't have side-effects), so I wouldn't use one here since the code modifies <code>control.Items</code> but that is a style choice. Putting it all together, this is how I would write it:</p>

<pre><code>return control if control.cycles_count == 0
control.items.reject! {|item| item.value.include?('|') }
control
</code></pre>

<p>Note: I don't have a working install of IronRuby right now, so I am making a few assumptions that I can unfortunately not test:</p>

<ul>
<li>method name transliteration (<code>CyclesCount</code> -> <code>cycles_count</code>) works, </li>
<li><code>Value</code> is some kind of <code>String</code> or collection and </li>
<li><code>ListItemCollection</code> mixes in <code>Enumerable</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The latter <em>should</em> be the case if <code>ListItemCollection</code> implements <code>IEnumerable</code> (otherwise I would consider that a bug in IronRuby). If <code>ListItemCollection</code> does <em>not</em> implement <code>IEnumerable</code> (which I would probably consider a bug in <code>ListItemCollection</code>), that is still easily fixed:</p>

<pre><code>class ListItemCollection; include Enumerable end
</code></pre>

<p>[BTW: I would also introduce a <code>cycles?</code> method (or a <code>bool HasCycles</code> property on the .NET side), so that you can get rid of the <code>cycle_count == 0</code> test.]</p>

"<p>Someone on the Herding Code podcast No. 68, <a href=""http://herdingcode.com/?p=231"">http://herdingcode.com/?p=231</a>, stated that IOC containers had no place with Python or Javascript, or words to that effect.  I'm assuming this is conventional wisdom and that it applies to all dynamic languages.  Why?  What is it about dynamic languages that makes IOC containers unnecessary?</p>
","2988","","<p>Because they are already built into the language.</p>

<p>An IoC container provides two things:</p>

<ul>
<li>dynamic binding</li>
<li>a dynamic language (usually an incredibly crappy one, built on top of XML or in newer versions on top of Java annotations/.NET attributes)</li>
</ul>

<p>Dynamic binding is already part of the dynamic language and the dynamic language is already a dynamic language. Therefore, an IoC container simply doesn't make sense: the language is already an IoC container.</p>

<p>Another way to look at it: what is it that an IoC container allows you to do? It allows you to take independent components and wire them up together into an application, without any of the components knowing anything about each other. There is a name for wiring independent pieces together into an application: scripting! (That's pretty much the definition of scripting.) Many dynamic languages happen to also be pretty good at scripting, therefore they are perfect as IoC containers.</p>

<p>Please note that I am <em>not</em> talking about Dependency Injection or Inversion of Control. DI and IoC are <em>just</em> as important in dynamic languages as they are in static languages, for exactly the same reasons. What I am talking about are IoC containers and DI frameworks. Those <em>tools</em> are unnecessary, the <em>design principles</em> aren't.</p>

"<p>I've been working on trying to better understand Ruby and here's something I'm having trouble with:</p>

<pre><code>$SAFE = 1
puts $SAFE # 1  
proc {
  $SAFE = 2
  puts $SAFE  # 2
}.call
puts $SAFE # 1   
</code></pre>

<p>The above code is partially taken from eRB's source rewritten to better highlight the example. Basically within the proc one can set the value of <code>$SAFE</code> to whatever value one wants and after the proc, the value of <code>SAFE</code> returns back to what it was before the proc.</p>

<p>If instead of using the word <code>$SAFE</code> I change it to a different word, such as <code>$DOOR</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$DOOR = 1
puts $DOOR 
proc {
  $DOOR = 2
  puts $DOOR  
}.call
puts $DOOR  
</code></pre>

<p>then the value of <code>$DOOR</code> after the proc is 2 and not 1. Why the difference between the two examples?</p>
","2988","","<p>It's rather simple, really: the reason why <code>$SAFE</code> doesn't behave like you would expect from a global variable is because it isn't a global variable. It's a magic unicorn thingamajiggy.</p>

<p>There are quite a few of those magic unicorn thingamajiggies in Ruby, and they are unfortunately not very well documented (not at all documented, in fact), as the developers of the alternative Ruby implementations found out the hard way. These thingamajiggies all behave differently and (seemingly) inconsistently, and pretty much the only two things they have in common is that they look like global variables but don't behave like them.</p>

<p>Some have local scope. Some have thread-local scope. Some magically change without anyone ever assigning to them. Some have magic meaning for the interpreter and change how the language behaves. Some have other weird semantics attached to them.</p>

<p><code>$SAFE</code> has almost all of the above: it is thread-local, meaning that if you change it in one thread, it doesn't affect other threads. It is local, meaning if you change it in a local scope (like a class, module, method or block), it doesn't affect the outer scope (as you have discovered). It has magic meaning for the interpreter, since setting it to a value different than <code>0</code> makes certain things not work. And it has additional weird semantics in that you can only ever <em>increase</em> its value, never <em>decrease</em> it.</p>

"<p>I want a function that keeps local state in Ruby. Each time I call the function I want to return a result that depends both on a calling argument and on the function's stored state. Here's a simple example:</p>

<p>(Note: My actual example is much more
   complicated, and initializing the

","2988","","<blockquote>
  <p>I want a <strong>function</strong> that keeps local state in Ruby.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That word ""function"" should immediately raise a big fat red flashing warning sign that you are using the wrong programming language. If you want functions, you should use a functional programming language, not an object-oriented one. In a functional programming language, functions usually close over their lexical environment, which makes what you are trying to do absolutely trivial:</p>

<pre><code>var state;
function incMult(factor) {
    if (state === undefined) {
        state = 0;
    }
    state += 1;
    return factor * state;
}
print(incMult(2)); // =&gt; 2
print(incMult(2)); // =&gt; 4
print(incMult(2)); // =&gt; 6
</code></pre>

<p>This particular example is in ECMAScript, but it looks more or less the same in <em>any</em> functional programming language.</p>

<p>[Note: I'm aware that it's not a very good example, because ECMAScript is actually also an object-oriented language and because it has broken scope semantics that atually mean that <code>state</code> leaks in this case, too. In a language with proper scope semantics (and in a couple of years, ECMAScript will be one of them), this'll work as intended. I used ECMAScript mainly for its familiar syntax, not as an example of a good functional language.]</p>

<p>This is the way that state is encapsulated in functional languages since, well, since there are functional languages, all the way back to lambda calculus.</p>

<p>However, in the 1960s some clever people noticed that this was a very common pattern, and they decided that this pattern was <em>so</em> common that it deserved its own language feature. And thus, the <em>object</em> was born.</p>

<p>So, in an object-oriented language, instead of using functional closures to encapsulate state, you would use objects. As you may have noticed, methods in Ruby don't close over their lexical environment, unlike functions in functional programming languages. And this is precisely the reason: because encapsulation of state is achieved via other means.</p>

<p>So, in Ruby you would use an object like this:</p>

<pre><code>inc_mult = Object.new
def inc_mult.call(factor)
  @state ||= 0
  @state += 1
  factor * @state
end
p inc_mult.(2) # =&gt; 2
p inc_mult.(2) # =&gt; 4
p inc_mult.(2) # =&gt; 6
</code></pre>

<p>[Sidenote: This 1:1 correspondence is what functional programmers are talking about when they say ""objects are just a poor man's closures"". Of course, object-oriented programmers usually counter with ""closures are just a poor man's objects"". And the funny thing is, both of them are right and neither of them realize it.]</p>

<p>Now, for completeness' sake I want to point out that while methods don't close over their lexical environment, there is one construct in Ruby, which <em>does</em>: blocks. (Interestingly enough, blocks aren't objects.) And, since you can define methods using blocks, you can also define methods which are closures:</p>

<pre><code>foo = Object.new
state = nil
foo.define_singleton_method :inc_mult do |factor|
  state ||= 0
  state += 1
  factor * state
end
p foo.inc_mult(2) # =&gt; 2
p foo.inc_mult(2) # =&gt; 4
p foo.inc_mult(2) # =&gt; 6

They start up <em>very</em> quickly, they die <em>very</em> quickly and you are expected to be able to use them for very short tasks. Every Erlang Process has its own Garbage Collector associated with it. Erlang Processes can never share memory, ever.</p>

<p>Windows Processes are very heavy, sometimes hundreds of MiBytes. You can start maybe a couple of thousand of them on a beefy server, if you are lucky. They start up and die pretty slowly. Windows Processes are the units of Applications such as IDEs or Text Editors or Word Processors, so they are usually expected to live quite a long time (at least several minutes). They have their own Address Space, but no Garbage Collector. Windows Processes can share memory, although by default they don't.</p>

<p>Threads are a similar matter: an NPTL Linux Thread on x86 can be as small as 4 KiByte and with some tricks you can start 800000+ on a 32 Bit x86 machine. The machine will certainly be useable with thousands, maybe tens of thousands of threads. A .NET CLR Thread has a minimum size of about 1 MiByte, which means that just 4000 of those will eat up your entire address space on a 32 Bit machine. So, while 4000 NPTL Linux Threads is generally not a problem, you can't even <em>start</em> 4000 .NET CLR Threads because you will run out of memory before that.</p>

<p>OS Processes and OS Threads are also implemented very differently between different Operating Systems. The main two approaches are: the kernel knows only about processes. Threads are implemented by a Userspace Library, without any knowledge of the kernel at all. In this case, there are again two approaches: 1:1 (every Thread maps to one Kernel Process) or m:n (m Threads map to n Processes, where usually m > n and often n == #CPUs). This was the early approach taken on many Operating Systems after Threads were invented. However, it is usually deemed inefficient and has been replaced on almost all systems by the second approach: Threads are implemented (at least partially) in the kernel, so that the kernel now knows about two distinct entities, Threads and Processes.</p>

<p>One Operating System that goes a third route, is Linux. In Linux, Threads are neither implemented in Userspace nor in the Kernel. Instead, the Kernel provides an abstraction of <em>both</em> a Thread and a Process (and indeed a couple of more things), called a Task. A Task is a Kernel Scheduled Entity, that carries with it a set of flags that determine which resources it shares with its siblings and which ones are private.</p>

<p>Depending on how you set those flags, you get either a Thread (share pretty much everything) or a Process (share all system resources like the system clock, the filesystem namespace, the networking namespace, the user ID namespace, the process ID namespace, but <em>do not share</em> the Address Space). But you can also get some other pretty interesting things, too. You can trivially get BSD-style jails (basically the same flags as a Process, but don't share the filesystem or the networking namespace). Or you can get what other OSs call a Virtualization Container or Zone (like a jail, but don't share the UID and PID namespaces and system clock). Since a couple of years ago via a technology called KVM (Kernel Virtual Machine) you can even get a full-blown Virtual Machine (share nothing, not even the processor's Page Tables). [The cool thing about this is that you get to reuse the highly-tuned mature Task Scheduler in the kernel for all of these things. One of the things the Xen Virtual Machine has often criticized for, was the poor performance of its scheduler. The KVM developers have a much superior scheduler than Xen, and the best thing is they didn't even have to write a single line of code for it!]</p>

<p>So, on Linux, the performance of Threads and Processes is much closer than on Windows and many other systems, because on Linux, they are actually the same thing. Which means that the usage patterns are very different: on Windows, you typically decide between using a Thread and a Process based on their weight: can I afford a Process or should I use a Thread, even though I actually don't want to share state? On Linux (and usually Unix in general), you decide based on their semantics: do I actually want to share state or not?</p>

<p>One reason <em>why</em> Processes tend to be lighter on Unix than on Windows, is different usage: on Unix, Processes are the basic unit of both concurrency and functionality. If you want to use concurrency, you use multiple Processes. If your application can be broken down into multiple independent pieces, you use multiple Processes. Every Process does exactly one thing and <em>only</em> that one thing. Even a simple one-line shell script often involves dozens or hundreds of Processes. Applications usually consist of many, often short-lived Processes.</p>

<p>On Windows, Threads are the basic units of concurrency and COM components or .NET objects are the basic units of functionality. Applications usually consist of a single long-running Process.</p>

<p>Again, they are used for very different purposes and have very different design goals. It's not that one or the other is better or worse, it's just that they are <em>so</em> different that the common characteristics can only be described very abstractly.</p>

<p>Pretty much the only few things you can say about Threads and Processes are that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Threads belong to Processes</li>
<li>Threads are lighter than Processes</li>
<li>Threads share most state with each other</li>
<li>Processes share significantly less state than Threads (in particular, they generally share no memory, unless specifically requested)</li>
</ul>

"<p>Despite reading ""<a href=""http://glu.ttono.us/articles/2005/08/19/understanding-ruby-symbols"">Understanding Ruby Symbols</a>"", I'm still confused by the representation of the data in memory when it comes to using symbols.  If a symbol, two of them contained in different objects, exist in the same memory location, then how is it that they contain <em>different</em> values?  I'd have expected the same memory location to contain the same value.  As a quote from the link:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unlike strings, symbols of the same name are initialized and exist in memory only once during a session of ruby</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I just don't understand how it manages to differentiate the values contained in the same memory location.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>So let's consider the example:</p>

patient2 = { :ruby =&gt; ""programming"" }

patient1.each_key {|key| puts key.object_id.to_s}
3918094
patient2.each_key {|key| puts key.object_id.to_s}
3918094
</code></pre>

<p><code>patient1</code> and <code>patient2</code> are both hashes, that's fine.  <code>:ruby</code> however is a symbol.  If we were to output the following:</p>

<pre><code>patient1.each_key {|key| puts key.to_s}
</code></pre>

<p>Then what will be output? <code>""red""</code>, or <code>""programming""</code>?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>FURTHER EDIT</strong></p>

<p>I'm still really quite confused.  I'm thinking a symbol is a <em>pointer</em> to a value.  Let's forget hashes for a second.  The questions I have are; can you assign a value to a symbol? Is a symbol just a pointer to a variable with a value in it?  If symbols are global, does that mean a symbol always points to one thing?</p>

"<p>I seem to not be able to do this (which I used to be able to do in Python). Let me explain ..</p>

<p>Suppose I have the following method in Ruby:</p>

<pre><code>def someMethod(arg1=1,arg2=2,arg3=3)
...
...
...
end
</code></pre>

<p>Now to call this method I could do</p>

<pre><code>someMethod(2,3,4)
someMethod(2,3)
someMethod(2)
</code></pre>

<p>and the arguments are taken by their respective order.. but what if I want to give arg2 at some point in my programming and want the default values for arg1 and arg3?</p>

<p>I tried writing someMethod(arg2=4) but this doesn't seem to work in Ruby 1.9.  What it does is it still thinks that arg1 is 4. In python I could at least get away with this, but in ruby I am not sure. Does anyone have any elegant ideas?</p>
","2988","","<p>Ruby doesn't have keyword argument passing. (Not yet, anyway, it is one of the things that might make it into Ruby 2.0. However, there are no guarantees, and work on Ruby 2.0 hasn't even <em>started</em> yet, so there's no telling when or even if we will see keyword arguments in Ruby.)</p>

<p>What <em>really</em> happens, is this: you are passing the expression <code>arg2 = 4</code> as the only argument in the argument list. Ruby is a strict language with pass-by-value, which means that all arguments are fully evaluated before they are passed to the method. In this case, <code>arg2 = 4</code> is an assignment expression (in Ruby, <em>everything</em> is an expression (i.e. everything returns a value), there are no statements). You are assigning the immediate literal <code>Fixnum</code> value <code>4</code> to the local variable <code>arg2</code>. Assignment expressions <em>always</em> return the value of their right-hand side, in this case <code>4</code>.</p>

<p>So, you are passing the value <code>4</code> as the only argument into your method, which means that it gets bound to the first mandatory parameter if there is one (in this case, there isn't), otherwise to the first optional parameter (in this case <code>arg1</code>).</p>

<p>The usual way to deal with situations like this is to use a <code>Hash</code> instead, like this:</p>

<pre><code>some_method({:arg2 =&gt; 4})
</code></pre>

<p>Because this pattern is used so often, there is special syntactic support: if the <em>last</em> argument to a method is a <code>Hash</code>, you can leave off the curly braces:</p>

<pre><code>some_method(:arg2 =&gt; 4)
</code></pre>

<p>In Ruby 1.9, there is another syntactical convenience form: because <code>Hash</code>es are so often used with <code>Symbol</code> keys, there is an alternative <code>Hash</code> literal syntax for that:</p>

<pre><code>some_method({arg2: 4})
</code></pre>

<p>Combine them both, and you <em>almost</em> have keyword arguments:</p>

<pre><code>some_method(arg2: 4)
</code></pre>

<p>(In fact, both of these shortcuts were specifically added to provide an easy migration path towards possible future versions of Ruby with keyword arguments.)</p>

<p>MacRuby actually supports Smalltalk-style multipart message selectors for interoperability with Objective-C. Note, however, that Smalltalk-style multipart message selectors are <em>not</em> keyword arguments, they behave very differently. Also, of course, this extension is specific to MacRuby and not part of the Ruby Specification and not portable to MRI, YARV, JRuby, XRuby, IronRuby, MagLev, Rubinius, tinyrb, RubyGoLightly, BlueRuby, SmallRuby or any other Ruby Implementation.</p>

"<p>Would someone be able to break down the Ruby specifics of what each of these statements consist of in as far as methods, parameters, block interpretations etc. This is very common to see in Rails code and I'm trying to understand how the Ruby interpreter reads this code:</p>

<pre><code>respond_to do |format|
  format.xml { render :layout =&gt; false }
end
</code></pre>

<p>In as far as I understand, respond_to is a method that's taking one parameter to it, a block. So I'm guessing it's written something like:</p>

<pre><code>def respond_to(&amp;block)
    block.call
end
</code></pre>

<p>.. or something similar?</p>

<p>in the block itself, format is the object respond_to passes into the block and xml is what the request is set to, at which point it calls a block in itself if the request is asking for XML type data and goes ahead and invokes a render method, passing it a keyword based argument, :layout => false?</p>

<p>Would someone clean up my understanding of how they above works. This type of code is all over Rails and I'd like to understand it before using it more.</p>
","2988","","<p>This is a typical Implementation Pattern for Internal DSLs in Ruby: you yield an object to the block which then itself accepts new method calls and blocks and thus guides the interface. (Actually, it's pretty common in Java, too, where it is used to get meaningful code completion for Internal DSLs.)</p>

<p>Here's an example:</p>

<pre><code>def respond_to
  yield FormatProxy.new(@responders ||= {})
end

class FormatProxy
  def initialize(responders)
    @responders = responders
  end

  def method_missing(msg, *args, &amp;block)
    @responders[msg] = [args, block]
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Now you have a mapping of formats to executable pieces of code stored in <code>@responders</code> and you can call it later and in a different place, whenever, whereever and however often you want:</p>

<pre><code>respond_to do |f|
  f.myformat { puts 'My cool format' }
  f.myotherformat { puts 'The other' }
end

@responders[:myformat].last.call # =&gt; My cool format
@responders[:myotherformat].last.call # =&gt; The other
</code></pre>

<p>As I hinted at above, if instead of a dumb proxy object that simply uses <code>method_missing</code>, you were to use one which had the most important methods (<code>xml</code>, <code>html</code>, <code>json</code>, <code>rss</code>, <code>atom</code> and so on) predefined, a sufficiently intelligent IDE could even give you meaningful code completion.</p>

<p>Note: I have absolutely no idea whether this is how it is implemented in Rails, but however it is implemented, it is probably some variation of this.</p>

","2988","","<p>In the past, the go-to method for binding Ruby to C (or C to Ruby, it doesn't really matter) was writing an MRI C extension by hand. <a href=""http://SWIG.Org/"" rel=""nofollow"">SWIG</a> basically automates that, but in a really crappy way, so that writing it by hand is usually easier, faster, more performant.</p>

<p>However, there is a significant problem with MRI C extensions: they are <em>MRI</em> C extensions.

<p>Of course, there is another problem with MRI C extensions: you have to write them in C.</p>

<p>A better solution is the <a href=""http://Ruby-Doc.Org/stdlib/libdoc/dl/rdoc/"" rel=""nofollow"">DL library in the Ruby standard library</a>, which allows you to bind to a dynamic library (<code>.dll</code>, <code>.so</code>, <code>.dylib</code>) at runtime, in pure Ruby. Unfortunately, it's pretty badly documented and because of that, it is not very well supported (or completely unsupported) by several Ruby Implementations: how are you going to provide a compatible implementation if there is no documentation of what ""compatible implementation"" means?</p>

<p><a href=""http://Rubini.us/"" rel=""nofollow"">Rubinius</a> introduced the <a href=""https://GitHub.Com/FFI/FFI/"" rel=""nofollow"">Rubinius Foreign Function Interface (FFI)</a>, which is <a href=""https://Wiki.GitHub.Com/FFI/FFI/Basic-Usage/"" rel=""nofollow"">much easier to use than DL</a>, much easier to <em>implement</em> for Ruby VM writers and <a href=""https://Wiki.GitHub.Com/FFI/FFI/"" rel=""nofollow"">fully documented</a>, <a href=""https://Wiki.GitHub.Com/FFI/FFI/Proposal-for-Standard-10-API/"" rel=""nofollow"">specified</a> and <a href=""https://GitHub.Com/FFI/FFI/tree/master/spec/"" rel=""nofollow"">tested</a>. <a href=""http://JRuby.Org/"" rel=""nofollow"">JRuby</a> immediately copied the API, Wayne Meissner wrote <a href=""http://RubyGems.Org/gems/ffi/"" rel=""nofollow"">two C extensions for MRI and YARV</a>, <a href=""http://Code.MACournoyer.Com/tinyrb/"" rel=""nofollow"">tinyrb</a> supports it, <a href=""http://IronRuby.Net/"" rel=""nofollow"">IronRuby</a>, <a href=""http://MacRuby.Org/"" rel=""nofollow"">MacRuby</a> and <a href=""http://MagLev.GemStone.Com/"" rel=""nofollow"">MagLev</a> will pretty soon.</p>

"<p>I'm working on a system than has to be pretty scalable from the beginning. I've started looking at / playing around with asynchronous/evented approaches to writing serverside code. I've played around with both ruby's EventMachine and node.js.</p>

<p>Node.js is awesome, but it's... uhh.. it's javascript.</p>

<p>Can the greater Stack Overflow community help me out by listing other languages that have strong asynchronous support? To qualify, the language would need to support both closures and have libraries for asynchronous file io, http, etc. It would be nice to have something like node.js that was written in a stronger language than javascript. </p>

<p>Lisp? Python has twisted, right? </p>
","2988","","<p>I would recommend that you take another look at <a href=""http://NodeJS.Org/"" rel=""nofollow"">node.js</a>. One of the biggest problems with using libraries to do event-based programming in an object-oriented programming language (rather than using an event-based programming language in the first place), is that usually all the <em>other</em> existing libraries are <em>not</em> event-based and it is really awkward to mix event-based and synchronous I/O. In fact, it is pretty much impossible, or more precisely, it <em>is</em> possible but destroys all the benefits of using event-based I/O in the first place. (Note that pretty much any third-party library you use (and the libraries that <em>they</em> use, and so forth), including the standard and core libraries of the language itself, must event-based, to actually reap the benefits. Otherwise, you'll spend the most time of your project writing asynchronous wrappers around existing libraries.)</p>

<p>Now, if using event-based libraries is such a bad thing, then why do I recommend node.js? Simple: ECMAScript doesn't <em>have</em> any synchronous I/O libraries (because of the simple fact that it doesn't have any I/O libraries <em>at all</em>), so the mixing problem simply doesn't arise. (Actually, it has <em>some</em> I/O libraries, like <code>XmlHttpRequest</code> or Web Sockets, but guess what: those are <em>already</em> all event-based.)</p>

<p>node.js implements all I/O libraries itself, all event-based, without backwards-compatibility or legacy requirements.</p>

<p>Lately I've been curious about other programming paradigms out there, so I thought I'd ask other developers their opinions on the similarities &amp; differences between these paradigms, specifically to OOP? In OOP, I find that there's a strong focus on the relationships and logical interactions between concepts. What are the mind frames you have to be in for the other paradigms?</p>

","2988","","<p>By far the best explanations of programming paradigms are found in Peter van Roy's works. Especially in the book <a href=""http://WWW.Info.UCL.Ac.Be/~pvr/book""><em>Concepts, Techniques, and Models of Computer Programming</em> by Peter Van Roy and Seif Haridi</a>. (<a href=""http://CodePoetics.Com/wiki/"">Here's the companion wiki.</a>) CTM uses the <a href=""http://WWW.Mozart-Oz.Org/"">multi-paradigm Distributed Oz programming language</a> to introduce all the major programming paradigms.</p>

<p>Peter van Roy also made <a href=""http://WWW.Info.UCL.Ac.Be/~pvr/paradigms"">this amazing poster that shows the 34 major paradigms and their relations and positions on various axis</a>. The poster is basically an incredibly compressed version of CTM. A more thorough explanation of that poster is contained in the article <a href=""http://WWW.Info.UCL.Ac.Be/~pvr/VanRoyChapter"">Programming Paradigms for Dummies: What Every Programmer Should Know</a> which appeared as a chapter in the book <em>New Computational Paradigms for Computer Music</em>, edited by G. Assayag and A. Gerzso.</p>

<p><em>Another</em> great book that demonstrates several major programming paradigms is <a href=""http://MITPress.MIT.Edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html""><em>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</em> by Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman</a>. This book was the basis of MIT's CS101 for several decades. <a href=""http://SWISS.CSAIL.MIT.Edu/classes/6.001/abelson-sussman-lectures/"">A course taught by Abelson and Sussman themselves was recorded at a corporate training for Hewlett-Packard in 1986</a>.</p>

<p>The main difference between CTM and SICP is that CTM demonstrates most major paradigms using a language that supports them (mostly Distributed Oz, but also some others). SICP OTOH demonstrates them by <em>implementing</em> them in a language that does <em>not</em> support them natively (a subset of Scheme). Seeing Object-Orientation implemented in a dozen or so lines of code is friggin' awesome.</p>

<p>You can find <a href=""http://OCW.MIT.Edu/OcwWeb/Electrical-Engineering-and-Computer-Science/6-001Spring-2005/CourseHome/"">video recordings and course materials from the Spring 2005 course on MIT's OpenCourseWare website</a>. <a href=""http://ADUni.Org/courses/sicp/"">Another recording of the course from MIT's short-lived ArsDigita University project</a>. SICP has also been taught at other universities, in fact <a href=""http://WebCast.Berkeley.Edu/course_details_new.php?seriesid=2008-D-26263"">it is being taught at Berkley right now</a>.</p>

<p>On a personal note, my own experience has been that <em>really</em> understanding a programming paradigm is only possible</p>

<ul>
<li>one paradigm at a time and</li>
<li>in languages which <em>force</em> you into the paradigm</li>
</ul>

<p>Ideally, you would use a language which takes the paradigm to the extreme. In multi-paradigm languages, it is much too easy to ""cheat"" and fall back on a paradigm that you are more comfortable with. And using a paradigm as a library is only really possible in languages like Scheme which are specifically designed for this kind of programming. Learning lazy functional programming in Java, for example, is not a good idea, although there are libraries for that.</p>

"<p>Is there some way to run 2 threads at the same time?</p>

<p>I want to have my app run its current function and then bring up another thread running another function, that can change variables in the first thread.</p>
","2988","","<p>If you want to run two threads at the same time, the entire execution stack has to be capable of doing that. Let's start at the top:</p>

<ol>
<li>Ruby itself is capable of running two threads at the same time, no problem there. However, Ruby is just a programming language, i.e. just a bunch of rules. In order to <em>run</em> your program, you need a Ruby <em>implementation</em>. Unfortunately, many popular Ruby implementations are <em>not</em> capable of running multiple threads at the same time, including MRI, YARV and Rubinius. In fact, the <em>only</em> production-ready Ruby implementation which <em>can</em> run threads simultaneously is JRuby. (IronRuby too, but that is technically not yet production-ready although the final 1.0 release is probably only days away.)</li>
<li>But JRuby (and IronRuby) don't actually implement threads themselves, they just use the underlying platform's threads. I.e. JRuby maps Ruby threads to JVM threads and IronRuby maps them to CLI threads. So, the underlying platform has to be able to run threads in parallel, too.</li>
<li>Again: both the JVM and the CLI are in principle capable of running threads in parallel, but the JVM and the CLI are just specifications, they are just pieces of paper. In order to run your code, you need an implementation of those specifications, and not all of them <em>do</em> support truly concurrent threads.</li>
<li>Even <em>if</em> your platform implementation supports truly concurrent threads, they might themselves delegate their threading implementation to the underlying OS, just like JRuby delegates to the JVM. .NET, Mono, HotSpot and JRockit for example (which are the most popular implementations of the CLI and the JVM respectively) use native OS threads for their platform threads. So, obviously, the OS has to be able to run threads in parallel. And again: not all of them are.</li>
<li>And, of course, all the parallelism in the OS doesn't help if you only have one CPU. If you want two threads to run at the same time, you need either two CPUs, two cores or two simultaneous hardware threads.</li>

"<p>Given the Java code below, what's the closest you could represent these two <code>static final</code> variables in a Ruby class? And, is it possible in Ruby to distinguish between <code>private static</code> and <code>public static</code> variables as there is in Java?</p>

","2988","","<p>There really is no equivalent construct in Ruby.</p>

<p>However, it looks like you are making one of the classic porting mistakes: you have a <em>solution</em> in language A and try to translate that into language B, when what you really should do is figure out the <em>problem</em> and then figure out how to solve it in language B.</p>

<p>I can't really be sure what the problem is you are trying to solve from that small codesnippet, but here is <em>one</em> possible idea for how to implement it in Ruby:</p>

<pre><code>class DeviceController
  class &lt;&lt; self
    def my_public_device;  @my_public_device  ||= Device['mydevice'] end

    private

    def my_private_device; @my_private_device ||= Device['mydevice'] end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Here's another:</p>

<pre><code>class DeviceController
  @my_public_device  ||= Device['mydevice']
  @my_private_device ||= Device['mydevice']

  class &lt;&lt; self
    attr_reader :my_public_device, :my_private_device
    private :my_private_device
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>(The difference is that the first example is lazy, it only initializes the instance variable when the corresponding attribute reader is first called. The second one initializes them as soon as the class body is executed, even if they are never needed, just like the Java version does.)</p>

<p>Let's go over some of the concepts here.</p>

<p>In Ruby, as in every other ""proper"" (for various definitions of ""proper"") object-oriented language, state (instance variables, fields, properties, slots, attributes, whatever you want to call them) is <em>always</em> private. There is <em>no way</em> to access them from the outside. The only way to communicate with an object is by sending it messages.</p>

<p>[Note: Whenever I write something like ""no way"", ""always"", ""the only way"" etc., it actually no means ""no way, except for reflection"". In this particular case, there is <code>Object#instance_variable_set</code>, for example.]</p>

<p>In other words: in Ruby, variables are always private, the only way to access them is via a getter and/or setter method, or, as they are called in Ruby, an attribute reader and/or writer.</p>

<p>Now, I keep writing about <em>instance variables</em>, but in the Java example we have <em>static fields</em>, i.e. <em>class</em> variables. Well, in Ruby, unlike Java, classes are objects, too. They are instances of the <code>Class</code> class and so, just like any other object, they can have instance variables. So, in Ruby, the equivalent to a class variable is really just a standard instance variable which belongs to an object which just happens to be a class.</p>

<p>(There are also class hierarchy variables, denoted with a double at sign <code>@@sigil</code>. Those are really weird, and you should probably just ignore them. Class hierarchy variables are shared across the entire class hierarchy, i.e. the class they belong to, all its subclasses and their subclasses and their subclasses ... and also all instances of all of those classes. Actually, they are more like global variables than class variables. They should really be called <code>$$var</code> instead of <code>@@var</code>, since they are much more closely related to global variables than instance variables. They are not entirely useless but only very rarely useful.)</p>

<p>So, we have covered the ""field"" part (Java field == Ruby instance variable), we have covered the ""public"" and ""private"" parts (in Ruby, instance variables are always private, if you want to make them public, use a public getter/setter method) and we have covered the ""static"" part (Java static field == Ruby class instance variable). What about the ""final"" part?</p>

<p>In Java, ""final"" is just a funny way of spelling ""const"", which the designers avoided because the <code>const</code> keyword in languages like C and C++ is subtly broken and they didn't want to confuse people. Ruby <em>does</em> have constants (denoted by starting with a capital letter). Unfortunately, they are not really constant, because trying to modify them, while generating a warning, actually works. So, they are more of a convention than a compiler-enforced rule. However, the more important restriction of constants is that they are always public.</p>

<p>So, constants are almost perfect: they cannot be modified (well, they <em>shouldn't</em> be modified), i.e. they are <code>final</code>, they belong to a class (or module), i.e. they are <code>static</code>. But they are always <code>public</code>, so unfortunately they cannot be used to model <code>private static final</code> fields.</p>

<p>And this is exactly the point where thinking about problems instead of solutions comes in. What is it that you want? You want state that </p>

<ol>
<li>belongs to a class, </li>
<li>can only be read not written, </li>
<li>is only initialized once and </li>
<li>can be either private or public.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can achieve all of that, but in a completely different way than in Java:</p>

<ol>
<li>class instance variable</li>
<li>don't provide a setter method, only a getter</li>
<li>use Ruby's <code>||=</code> compound assignment to assign only once</li>
<li>getter method</li>
</ol>

<p>The only thing you have to worry about, is that you don't assign to <code>@my_public_device</code> anywhere, or better yet, don't access it at all. Always use the getter method.</p>

<p>Yes, this <em>is</em> a hole in the implementation. Ruby is often called a ""grown-up's language"" or a ""consenting adults language"", which means that instead of having the compiler enforce certain things, you just put them in the documentation and simply trust that your fellow developers have learned that touching other people's privates is rude ...</p>

<hr>

<p>A totally <em>different</em> approach to privacy is the one used in functional languages: use closures. Closures are blocks of code that close over their lexical environment, even after that lexical environment has gone out of scope. This method of implementing private state is very popular in Scheme, but has recently also been popularized by Douglas Crockford et al. for JavaScript. Here's an example in Ruby:</p>

<pre><code>class DeviceController
  class &lt;&lt; self
    my_public_device, my_private_device = Device['mydevice'], Device['mydevice']

    define_method :my_public_device  do my_public_device  end
    define_method :my_private_device do my_private_device end

    private :my_private_device
  end # &lt;- here the variables fall out of scope and can never be accessed again
end
</code></pre>

<p>Note the subtle but important difference to the versions at the top of my answer: the lack of the <code>@</code> sigil. Here, we are creating <em>local</em> variables, not <em>instance</em> variables. As soon as the class body ends, those local variables fall out of scope and can never be accessed ever again. <em>Only</em> the two blocks which define the two getter methods still have access to them, because they close over the class body. Now, they are <em>really</em> private <em>and</em> they are <code>final</code>, because the only thing in the entire program which still has access to them is a pure <em>getter</em> method.</p>

<p>This is probably not idiomatic Ruby, but for anyone with a Lisp or JavaScript background it should be clear enough. It is also very elegant.</p>

"<p>I have a bunch of data in (what i think is) a tcl array. Basically it's in the form of <code>{a {b c} d {e f} g}</code>.

I want to extract this array so I can use it in ruby.</p>

<p>My first thought was, ""No problem, I'll write a little grammar to parse this."" I installed the treetop gem, and wrote up a parser, which seemed to work just fine. I started having problems when I tried to extract an array from the parsed tree. I would like to better understand the cause of the problems and what I am doing wrong.</p>

<p>Here is my parser code so far: (tcl_array.treetop)</p>

<pre><code>grammar TCLArray
  rule array
    ""{"" [\s]* ""}"" {
      def content
        []
      end
    }
    /
    ""{"" [\s]* array_element_list [\s]* ""}"" {
      def content
        array_element_list.content
      end
    }
  end

  rule array_element_list
    array_element {
      def content
        [array_element.content]
      end
    }
    /
    array_element [\s]+ array_element_list {
      def content
        [array_element.content] + array_element_list.content
      end
    }
  end

  rule array_element
    [^{}\s]+ {
      def content
        return text_value
      end
    }
    /
    array {
      def content
        array.content
      end
    }
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Invoking <code>p.parse(""{a}"").content</code> yields <code>tcl_array.rb:99:in 'content': undefined local variable or method 'array_element'</code></p>

<p>The first term in array_element_list (array_element) says that array_element is an undefined local variable, but accessor methods are supposed to be automatically defined according to the treetop documentation.</p>

<p>Earlier, I tried a solution that was based off of a grammar with fewer but slightly more complicated rules:</p>

<pre><code>grammar TCLArray
  rule array
    ""{"" ([\s]* array_element ([\s]+ array_element)* )? [\s]* ""}""
  end

  rule array_element
    [^{}\s]+ / array
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>But with this grammar I had issues where the parser seemed to be creating several different expressions for the array rule even though it did not use any alternative expressions (/). The result was that I couldn't figure out how to access the various bits of the array rule to return them as a ruby array.</p>

<p>In my opinion IoC has reasonable advantages and would make it easy to replace the django-default-user-model for example, but extensive usage of interface classes and IoC in Python looks a bit odd and not »pythonic«. But maybe someone has a better explanation, why IoC isn't widely used in Python.</p>
","2988","","<p>I don't actually think that DI/IoC are <em>that</em> uncommon in Python. What <em>is</em> uncommon, however, are DI/IoC <em>frameworks/containers</em>.</p>

<p>Think about it: what does a DI container do? It allows you to </p>

<ol>
<li>wire together independent components into a complete application ...</li>
<li>... at runtime.</li>
</ol>

<p>We have names for ""wiring together"" and ""at runtime"":</p>

<ol>
<li>scripting</li>
<li>dynamic</li>
</ol>

<p>So, a DI container is nothing but an interpreter for a dynamic scripting language. Actually, let me rephrase that: a typical Java/.NET DI container is nothing but a crappy interpreter for a really bad dynamic scripting language with butt-ugly, often XML-based, syntax.</p>

<p>When you program in Python, why would you want to use an ugly, bad scripting language when you have a beautiful, brilliant scripting language at your disposal? Actually, that's a more general question: when you program in pretty much any language, why would you want to use an ugly, bad scripting language when you have Jython and IronPython at your disposal?</p>

<p>So, to recap: the <em>practice</em> of DI/IoC is just as important in Python as it is in Java, for exactly the same reasons. The <em>implementation</em> of DI/IoC however, is built into the language and often so lightweight that it completely vanishes. (Here's an analogy: in assembly, a subroutine call is a pretty major deal - you have to save your local variables and registers to memory, save your return address somewhere, change the instruction pointer to the subroutine you are calling, arrange for it to somehow jump back into your subroutine when it is finished, put the arguments somewhere where the callee can find them, and so on. IOW: in assembly, ""subroutine call"" is a Design Pattern, and before there were languages like Fortran which had subroutine calls built in, people were building their own ""subroutine frameworks"". Would you say that subroutine calls are ""uncommon"" in Python, just because you don't use subroutine frameworks?)</p>

<p>BTW: for an example of what it looks like to take DI to its logical conclusion, take a look at <a href=""http://GBracha.BlogSpot.Com/"">Gilad Bracha</a>'s <a href=""http://NewspeakLanguage.Org/"">Newspeak Programming Language</a> and his writings on the subject:</p>

","2988","","<p>There's a couple of possibilities:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://JRuby.Org/"" rel=""nofollow"">JRuby</a> can run pretty much anywhere where there is a JVM, which means pretty much anywhere except iPhone. (Apparently, there's even JVM implementations for Windows Mobile.) Note that you need a <a href=""https://GitHub.Com/JRuby/JRuby-CDC/"" rel=""nofollow"">special stripped-down version</a> for JME-CDC (Java Platform Micro Edition - Connected Device Configuration), which hasn't been updated in a while. However, if you ask nicely, someone will probably at least help you build your own (it basically involves deleting stuff from the main version, recompile, test, delete more, recompile, test, ...).</li>
<li>JRuby can also run on Android. In fact, there's three versions available: JRuby is part of the <a href=""http://Android-Scripting.GoogleCode.Com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Android Scripting Environment (ASE)</a>, and then there's JRuby lead developer Charles Oliver ""Headius"" Nutter's <a href=""http://Ruboto.Com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Ruboto</a>. The very latest addition is <a href=""http://JRuby-for-Android.GoogleCode.Com/"" rel=""nofollow"">JRuby for Android</a> by Pascal Chatterjee.</li>
<li>MRI was once ported both to <a href=""http://Ruby-Symbian.RubyForge.Org/"" rel=""nofollow"">Symbian S60 (Nokia)</a> and <a href=""http://uema2.s8.xrea.com/ruby-mswince/"" rel=""nofollow"">Windows CE</a>, although I have no idea how hard that is to get working, how current these ports are, whether they are integrated into the official sourcetree or are maintained seperately (if at all) nor if it also applies to YARV. There <em>is</em> a <a href=""https://GitHub.Com/Ruby/Ruby/tree/trunk/symbian/"" rel=""nofollow"">Symbian subdirectory in the YARV sourcecode</a> which was last updated just 5 days ago, and a <a href=""https://GitHub.Com/Ruby/Ruby/tree/ruby_1_8/wince/"" rel=""nofollow"">Windows CE subdirectory in the MRI sourcecode</a> which was updated 6 months ago, though.</li>
<li>Apparently, <a href=""https://Wiki.GitHub.Com/Takuma104/iPhone-RubyCocoa/"" rel=""nofollow"">MRI also runs on the iPhone</a>.</li>
<li><a href=""http://Android-Ruby.GoogleCode.Com/"" rel=""nofollow"">YARV was recently ported to Android</a>.</li>
<li>It looks pretty likely that <a href=""http://MacRuby.Org/"" rel=""nofollow"">MacRuby</a> will, in the future, run on the iPhone. The MacRuby developers all either work for Apple or have signed NDAs and are therefore not allowed to say anything, but when one of the lead developers was asked what the new Ahead-of-Time compiler in MacRuby 0.5 would be useful for, he oracled something like ""running Ruby on resource-constrained ARM-powered pocket-sized mobile internet devices with security restrictions regarding interpreted code"" or something similarly cryptic.</li>
<li>The same applies to <a href=""http://IronRuby.Net/"" rel=""nofollow"">IronRuby</a>: since IronRuby runs on Silverlight and Silverlight is Microsoft's new phone platform (or everything-platform, really), I wouldn't be surprised to see IronRuby on at least the new Windows Phone 7. [EDIT: Actually, it already does, IronRuby on Windows Mobile 7 was demonstrated at MIX10.]</li>
<li>In the meantime, the <a href=""http://RhoMobile.Com/products/rhodes/"" rel=""nofollow"">Rhodes mobile framework</a> by <a href=""http://RhoMobile.Com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Rhomobile</a> allows you to develop cross-platform (iPhone, Windows Mobile, RIM (Blackberry), Symbian (Nokia) and Android) native mobile applications using HTML as the UI. The way it basically works, is that you write your UI in HTML which gets displayed by the native browser control that is built into the phone, and the Rhodes framework then supplies the necessary CSS and JavaScript to make it look and feel ""native"". However, it's <em>not</em> a web application: the webserver that serves the HTML <em>also</em> runs on the phone, as does the Ruby interpreter in which you run your models and controllers. (See <a href=""http://StackOverflow.Com/questions/2081657/is-there-a-common-language-for-cell-phone-software-development/2081856#2081856"">this answer I gave to another question for more details</a>.) Even if you don't want to use their framework, you can still steal <a href=""https://GitHub.Com/Rhomobile/Rhodes/tree/1-5-unstable/platform/"" rel=""nofollow"">their different Ruby interpreters for the different platforms</a>. E.g., they actually use <a href=""https://GitHub.Com/Rhomobile/Rhodes/tree/1-5-unstable/platform/shared/xruby/"" rel=""nofollow"">XRuby</a>, not JRuby for their <a href=""https://GitHub.Com/Rhomobile/Rhodes/blob/1-5-unstable/platform/bb/"" rel=""nofollow"">Blackberry port</a> and <a href=""https://GitHub.Com/Rhomobile/Rhodes/tree/1-5-unstable/platform/shared/ruby/"" rel=""nofollow"">YARV</a> via the Android Native Development Kit for their <a href=""https://GitHub.Com/Rhomobile/Rhodes/blob/1-5-unstable/platform/android/"" rel=""nofollow"">Android port</a>.</li>

"<p>I'm working on a module that, among other things, will add some generic 'finder' type functionality to the class you mix it into.  The problem: for reasons of convenience and aesthetics, I want to include some functionality <em>outside</em> the class, in the same scope as the class itself.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>class User
  include MyMagicMixin
end

# Should automagically enable:

User.name('Bob')   # Returns first user named Bob
Users.name('Bob')  # Returns ALL users named Bob 
User(5)            # Returns the user with an ID of 5
Users              # Returns all users
</code></pre>

<p>I can do the functionality <em>within</em> these methods, no problem.  And case 1 (<code>User.name('Bob')</code>) is easy.  Cases 2–4, however, require being able to create new classes and methods outside <code>User</code>.  The <code>Module.included</code> method gives me access to the class, but not to its containing scope.  There is no simple ""parent"" type method that I can see on Class nor Module.  (For namespace, I mean, not superclass nor nested modules.)</p>

<p>The best way I can think to do this is with some string parsing on the class's <code>#name</code> to break out its namespace, and then turn the string back into a constant.  But that seems clumsy, and given that this is Ruby, I feel like there should be a more elegant way.</p>

<p>Does anyone have ideas?  Or am I just being too clever for my own good?</p>
","2988","","<p>This is a problem that comes up sometimes on the mailinglists. It's also a problem that comes up in Rails. The solution is, as you already suspected, basically Regexp munging.</p>

<p>However, there is a more fundamental problem: in Ruby, classes do not have a name! A class is just an object like any other. You can assign it to an instance variable, to a local variable, to a global variable, to a constant or even not assign it to anything <em>at all</em>. The <code>Module#name</code> method is basically just a convenience method that works like this: it looks through the list of defined constants until it finds one that points to the receiver. If it finds one, it returns the first one it can find, otherwise it returns <code>nil</code>.</p>

<p>So, there's two failure modes here:</p>

<pre><code>a = Class.new
a.name # =&gt; nil
B = a
B.name # =&gt; ""B""
A = B
A.name # =&gt; ""B""
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>a class might not have a name at all</li>
<li>a class might have more than one name, but <code>Module#name</code> will only return the first one it finds</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, if someone tries to call <code>As</code> to get a list of <code>A</code>s, they will be pretty surprised to find that that method doesn't exist, but that they can call <code>Bs</code> instead to get the same result.</p>

<p>This <em>does</em> actually happen in reality. In MacRuby, for example <code>String.name</code> returns <code>NSMutableString</code>, <code>Hash.name</code> returns <code>NSMutableDictionary</code> and <code>Object.name</code> returns <code>NSObject</code>. The reason for this is that MacRuby integrates the Ruby runtime and the Objective-C runtime into one, and since the semantics of an Objective-C mutable string are identical to a Ruby string, the entire implementation of Ruby's string class is essentially  a single line: <code>String = NSMutableString</code>. And since MacRuby sits on top of Objective-C, that means that Objective-C starts first, which means that <code>NSMutableString</code> gets inserted into the symbol table first, which means it gets <em>found</em> first by <code>Module#name</code>.</p>

<li>Is there any way to pass a list of arguments to this method? I would ideally prefer debug {:x, :y. :anynumOfvariables}. I could not quite figure out how to factor that into the debug method (i.e, to take a list of arguments)</li>
</ol>
","2988","","<p>Just use arrays. You can use the <code>Array</code> method to ensure that you will always have an array, even if someone passes in only a single value:</p>

<pre><code>def debug(&amp;block)
  Array(block[]).each do |var| puts ""#{var} = #{eval var.to_s, block}"" end
end

debug {:x} # =&gt; ""x = 3""
debug {[:x, :y]} # =&gt; ""x = 3"" ""y = 5""

<p>BTW: passing a block as the binding no longer works in Ruby 1.9. (Despite the fact that the documentation says it <em>does</em> work.) You have to explicitly call <code>Proc#binding</code> to get a <code>Binding</code> object for that <code>Proc</code>:</p>

<pre><code>def debug(&amp;block)
  Array(block.()).flatten.each do |var|
    puts ""#{var} = #{eval var.to_s, block.binding}""
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Fortunately, this <em>already</em> works in Ruby 1.8, so you can futureproof your code by including it.</p>

<p>An alternative would be to forgo the block altogether. I mean, you <em>already</em> force the user of the <code>debug</code> to use the unfamiliar idiom of passing arguments in the block instead of in parentheses. Why not force them to just pass the binding instead?</p>

<pre><code>def debug(*vars, bnd)
  vars.each do |var|
    puts ""#{var} = #{eval var.to_s, bnd}""

x, y = 3, 5

debug :x, binding # =&gt; ""x = 3""
debug :x, :y, binding # =&gt; ""x = 3"" ""y = 5""

<p>This has the added flexibility that they can actually pass a <em>different</em> binding than the one at the callsite, e.g. if they want to actually debug a piece of code in a different piece of the application.</p>

<hr>

<p>BTW: here's some fun with Ruby 1.9.2's parameter introspection (<code>Proc#parameters</code>):</p>

<p>The first thing that gets evaluated here, is the expression</p>

<pre><code>h[0]
</code></pre>

<p>What happens when it gets evaluated? Well, the block gets run:</p>

<pre><code>[]
</code></pre>

<p>That's not very exciting: the block simply creates an empty array and returns it. It doesn't do anything else. In particular, it doesn't change <code>h</code> in any way: <code>h</code> is still empty.</p>

<p>Next, the message <code>&lt;&lt;</code> with one argument <code>'a'</code> gets sent to the result of <code>h[0]</code> which is the result of the block, which is simply an empty array:</p>

<pre><code>[] &lt;&lt; 'a'
</code></pre>

<p>What does this do? It adds the element <code>'a'</code> to an empty array, but since the array doesn't actually get assigned to any variable, it is immediately garbage collected and goes away.</p>

<p>Now, if you evaluate <code>h[0]</code> again:</p>

<pre><code>h[0] # =&gt; []
</code></pre>

<p><code>h</code> is <em>still</em> empty, since nothing ever got assigned to it, therefore the key <code>0</code> is still non-existent, which means the block gets run <em>again</em>, which means it <em>again</em> returns an empty array (but note that it is a completely new, <em>different</em> empty array now).</p>

<pre><code>h[0] += ['a']
</code></pre>

<p>What happens here? First, the operator assign gets desugared to </p>

<pre><code>h[0] = h[0] + ['a']
</code></pre>

<p>Now, the <code>h[0]</code> on the <em>right</em> side gets evaluated. And what does it return? We already went over this: <code>h[0]</code> doesn't exist, therefore the block gets run, the block returns an empty array. Again, this is a completely new, <em>third</em> empty array now. This empty array gets sent the message <code>+</code> with the argument <code>['a']</code>, which causes it to return yet <em>another</em> new array which is the array <code>['a']</code>. This array then gets assigned to <code>h[0]</code>.</p>

<p>Lastly, at this point:</p>

<pre><code>h[0] # =&gt; ['a']
</code></pre>

<p>Now you have <em>finally</em> actually put something into <code>h[0]</code> so, obviously, you get out what you put in.</p>

<p>So, to answer the question you probably had, why don't you get out what you put in? You <em>didn't</em> put anything in in the first place!</p>

<p>If you actually want to <em>assign</em> to the hash inside the block, you have to, well assign to the hash inside the block:</p>

<pre><code>h = Hash.new {|this_hash, nonexistent_key| this_hash[nonexistent_key] = [] }
h[0] &lt;&lt; 'a'
h[0] # =&gt; ['a']
</code></pre>

<p>It's actually fairly easy to see what is going on in your code example, if you look at the identities of the objects involved. Then you can see that everytime you call <code>h[0]</code>, you get a <em>different</em> array.</p>

"<p>I always come across articles which claim that Java is interpreted. I know that Oracle's HotSpot JRE provides just-in-time compilation, however is this the case for a majority of desktop users? For example, if I download Java via: <a href=""http://www.java.com/en/download"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.java.com/en/download</a>, will this include a JIT Compiler?</p>
","2988","","<p>There is nothing in the JVM specification that mandates any particular execution strategy. Some JVMs <em>only</em> interpret, they don't even <em>have</em> a compiler. Some JVMs <em>only</em> JIT compile, they don't even <em>have</em> an interpreter. Some JVMs have <em>both</em> an intepreter and a compiler (or even multiple compilers) and statically choose between the two on startup. Some have both and <em>dynamically</em> switch back and forth during runtime. Some aren't even virtual machines in the usual sense of the word <em>at all</em>, they just statically compile JVM bytecode into native machinecode ahead-of-time.</p>

<p>The particular JVM that you are asking about, Oracle's HotSpot JVM, has one interpreter and two compilers, called the C1 and C2 compiler, also colloquially known as the <em>client</em> and <em>server</em> compilers, after their corresponding commandline options. HotSpot dynamically switches back and forth between the interpreter and one of the compilers at runtime (but it will not switch between the two compilers, you have to specify one of them on the commandline and then only that one will be used for the entire runtime of the JVM).</p>

<p>The C1 compiler is an optimizing compiler which is pretty fast and doesn't use a lot of memory. The C2 compiler is much more aggressively optimizing, but is also slower and uses more memory.</p>

<p>You select between the two by specifying the <code>-client</code> and <code>-server</code> commandline options (<code>-client</code> is the default if you don't specify one), which also sets a couple of other JVM parameters like the default JIT threshold (in <code>-client</code> mode, methods will be compiled after they have been interpreted 1500 times, in <code>-server</code> mode after 10000 times, can be set with the <code>-XX:CompileThreshold</code> commandline argument).</p>

<p>Whether or not ""the majority of desktop users"" actually will run in compiled or interpreted mode depends largely on what code they are running. My guess is that the vast majority of desktop users run the HotSpot JVM from Oracle's JRE/JDK or one of its forks (e.g. SoyLatte on OSX, IcedTea or OpenJDK on Unix/BSD/Linux) and they don't fiddle with the commandline options, so they will probably get the C1 compiler with the default 1500 JIT threshold. (But applications such as IntelliJ, Eclipse or NetBeans have their own launcher scripts that usually supply different commandline arguments.)</p>

<p>In my case, for example, I often run small scripts which never actually reach the JIT threshold, so they are never compiled. (Nor should they be.)</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
","2988","","<p>The problem has nothing to do with <em>where</em> the classes get allocated. The problem is that classloaders always keep references to their classes, which means that classes cannot be garbage collected unless and until their classloader gets garbage collected.</p>

<p>This problem is just more obvious on HotSpot, because PermGen memory is scarce and expensive.</p>

"<p>What should be the content of the .gitignore file for a java project in netbeans?</p>

<p>If there are some files that you would like to ignore based on your specific environment (like e.g. Windows <code>Thumbs.db</code> and <code>desktop</code> files or NeBeans <code>nbproject</code> directories) you should do that in your global ignore list, not in the project-specific <code>.gitignore</code>&nbsp;&ndash; if only because then you don't need to add them to every single of your projects individually.</p>

"<p>Inspired by <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2599161/class-method-as-hash-value/2599661#2599661"">this discussion</a>, after some googling I wasn't able to find an answer to a pretty simple question regarding methods in Ruby: are methods objects or not?</p>

<p>There are different opinions <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/416047/examples-of-things-that-are-not-objects-in-ruby/416154#416154"">here</a> and <a href=""http://www.mentby.com/david-a-black/are-methods-objects.html"">there</a>, and I would really like to hear, let's say, an in-depth explanation.</p>

<p>I'm aware of <code>Object#method</code> method, which takes a method name and returns a <code>Method</code> instance, but, on the other hand, there's a similar thing you can do with blocks to make them into <code>Proc</code> instances, and blocks aren't objects, so what makes methods any different?</p>
","2988","","<p>You can't really tell.</p>

<p>The only way to get access to a method is to send the <code>#method</code> message to some object, which will then return a <code>Method</code> object. But is that <code>Method</code> object the method itself? Or is it a wrapper around the method? Or is it a converted version of the original method?</p>

<p>You can't know: if you want to look at a method, you have to call <code>#method</code>, at which point you definitely <em>will</em> get an object. What it was <em>before</em> you called <code>#method</code> you can't look at, therefore you can't tell.</p>

<p>A couple of datapoints: in Ruby, everything returns a value. What does <code>def</code> return? It <em>always</em> returns <code>nil</code>, not a <code>Method</code> object. And <code>define_method</code>? It returns a <code>Proc</code>, but not a <code>Method</code> (nor an <code>UnboundMethod</code>). [Note: in Rubinius, <code>def</code> returns the compiled bytecode of the method, but still not a <code>Method</code> object.]</p>

<p>If you look at the 4th and 5th paragraphs of Section 6.1 of the Ruby Language Specification (lines 29-34 and 1-5 on pages 5 and 6), you can clearly see that there is a distinction drawn between methods and objects. And if you look at the specification of the builtin classes, you will find that neither <code>Method</code> nor <code>UnboundMethod</code> are in there, nor is <code>Object#method</code>. IOW: you can build a perfectly standards-compliant Ruby interpreter in which methods <em>aren't</em> objects.</p>

<p>Now, blocks OTOH definitely <em>aren't</em> objects. There are many ways to <em>construct</em> <code>Proc</code> objects from blocks, which then have the same behavior as the original block (<code>lambda</code>, <code>proc</code>, <code>Proc.new</code>, the <code>&amp;</code> sigil), but blocks themselves aren't objects.</p>

<p>Think about it this way: you can pass a string to <code>File.new</code> to construct a file object, but that doesn't make a string a file. You can pass a block to <code>Proc.new</code> to construct a proc object, but that doesn't make a block a proc.</p>

<p>I found the <a href=""http://github.com/funkaster/shinycocos"" rel=""nofollow"">shinycocos</a> project, which appears to embed a Ruby interpreter in an app.  But I can't get it to run, and it seems pretty customized for running cocos2d stuff.</p>

<li>because of <strong><em>merge tracking</em></strong>, and the more fundamental fact that <strong><em>each revisions knows its parents</em></strong>. ... When each revision (each commit), including merge commits, know its parents (for merge commits that means having/remembering more than one parent, i.e. merge tracking), you can reconstruct diagram (DAG = Direct Acyclic Graph) of revision history. If you know graph of revisions, you can find common ancestor of the commits you want to merge. And when your DVCS knows itself how to <strong><em>find common ancestor</em></strong>, you don't need to provide it as an argument, as for example in CVS.<br>
.<br>
Note that there might be more than one common ancestor of two (or more) commits. Git makes use of so called ""recursive"" merge strategy, which merges merge bases (common ancestor), till you are left with one virtual / effective common ancestor (in some simplification), and can the do simple 3-way merge. – <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/users/46058/jakub-narebski"">Jakub Narębski</a>'s <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2613525/what-makes-merging-in-dvcs-easy#2614937"">answer</a></li>

<p>Does this look correct? Are there any other methods I should redefine?</p>
","2988","","<p>You shouldn't inherit from <code>String</code>, both for reasons of good object-oriented design and pure pragmatism.</p>

<p>If you inherit from <code>String</code>, you are violating the Liskov Substitution Principle, which states that instances of subclasses should be substitutable for instances of their superclass. This is not the case here: I can insert a space in the middle of a <code>String</code>, but I can not insert a space in the middle of a <code>Tag</code>, therefore a <code>Tag</code> is not a substitue for a <code>String</code>, and thus shouldn't be a subclass.</p>

<p>And as a purely practical matter: you are inheriting roughly 100 public instance methods from <code>String</code>. Do you <em>really</em> want to audit (and potentially override) <em>every single one</em> of them to ensure they don't violate <code>Tag</code>'s contract?</p>

<p>I would rather do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>require 'facets/multiton'

class Tag
  include Multiton

  attr_reader :name
  attr_accessor :description

  private

  def initialize name, description=nil
    raise ArgumentError, 'Tag name cannot contain whitespace' if str =~ /\s/

    self.name = name.to_s.dup.freeze
    self.description = description unless description.nil?
  end

  attr_writer :name

  def self.multiton_id name, description=nil
    return name.to_s.downcase

You can then use the <code>$_</code> special variable to access the current line and use the <code>next</code> keyword to skip iteration of the loop if you don't want the line printed:</p>

"<p>It is possible  for me to build my own Interpreter that could then be transformed into a compiler? If yes, how do I go about building it?</p>
","2988","","<p>This is called the Second Futamura Projection. It was first described by <a href=""http://fi.ftmr.info/"">Prof. Yoshihiko Futamura</a> in his 1971 paper <a href=""http://www.futamura.info.waseda.ac.jp/~futamura/PE-Museum/PE-Original-J.PDF""><em>Partial Evaluation of Computation Process&nbsp;&ndash; An approach to a Compiler-Compiler</em> (Japanese)</a>, an <a href=""http://www.brics.dk/~hosc/local/HOSC-12-4-pp381-391.pdf"">English version</a> of which was republished 28 years later.</p>

<p>It uses <a href=""http://Partial-Eval.Org/"">Partial Evaluation</a>, by partially evaluating the partial evaluator itself with respect to the interpreter, thus yielding a compiler.</p>

<p>So, you need two ingredients: an interpreter for your target language, written in some host language (which may or may not be the same as the target language) and a partial evaluator capable of evaluating both the interpreter and itself, in other words it needs to partially evaluate the host language and it needs to itself be written in the host language it can evaluate.</p>

"<p>I'm trying to figure out how to retrieve the value stored in the Person class.  The problem is just that after I define an instance of the Person class, I don't know how to retrieve it within the IronRuby code because the instance name is in the .NET part.</p>

        ScriptScope scope = engine.ExecuteFile(""c:\\Users\\ron\\RubymineProjects\\untitled\\person.rb"");

    //We get the class type
    object person = engine.Runtime.Globals.GetVariable(""Person"");

    //We create an instance
    object marcy = engine.Operations.CreateInstance(person, ""marcy"");
</code></pre>
","2988","","<p>[EDIT: Just installed VS and IronRuby and tested everything.]</p>

<p>The easiest way I can think of would be to type <code>marcy</code> as <code>dynamic</code> instead of <code>object</code>, and just call the accessor (which if I remember correctly is actually represented as a property on the .NET side):</p>

<pre><code>dynamic marcy = engine.Operations.CreateInstance(person, ""marcy"");
var name = marcy.name;
</code></pre>

<p>If you are not using .NET 4, you will have to go through the ""ugly"" string-based API:</p>

<pre><code>var name = engine.Operations.InvokeMember(marcy, ""name"");
</code></pre>

<p>BTW: If you <em>do</em> use .NET 4, you can also simplify some of your other code. For example, <code>Globals</code> implements <code>IDynamicObject</code> and provides an implemention of <code>TryGetProperty</code> that emulates Ruby's <code>method_missing</code>, so all in all you could do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>var engine = IronRuby.Ruby.CreateEngine();
engine.ExecuteFile(""person.rb"");
dynamic globals = engine.Runtime.Globals;
dynamic person = globals.Person;
dynamic marcy = person.@new(""marcy""); // why does new have to be a reserved word?
var name = marcy.name;
</code></pre>

<p>Notice how you can just ""dot into"" <code>Globals</code> to get the <code>Person</code> global constant, instead of having to pass it in as a string and you can just call the <code>new</code> method on the <code>Person</code> class (although you unfortunately have to escape it because <code>new</code> is a reserved word, although it would be trivial for the parser to know the difference) to create an instance.</p>

"<p>I've got a bit of fettish for language design and I'm currently playing around with my own hobby language. (<a href=""http://rogeralsing.com/2010/04/14/playing-with-plastic/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rogeralsing.com/2010/04/14/playing-with-plastic/</a>)</p>

<p>One thing that really makes my mind bleed is ""generators"" and the ""yield"" keyword.
I know C# uses AST transformation to transform enumerator methods into statemachines.</p>

<p>But how does it work in other languages?
Is there any way to get generator support in a language w/o AST transformation?
e.g. Does languages like Python or Ruby resort to AST transformations to solve this to?</p>

<p>(The question is how generators are implemented under the hood in different languages, not how to write a generator in one of them)</p>
","2988","","<p>Generators are basically semi-coroutines with some annoying limitations. So, obviously, you can implement them using semi-coroutines (and full coroutines, of course).</p>

<p>If you don't have coroutines, you can use any of the other universal control flow constructs. There are a lot of control flow constructs that are ""universal"" in the sense that <em>every</em> control flow construct (including all the other universal control flow constructs), including coroutines and thus generators can be (more or less) trivially transformed into only that universal construct.</p>

<p>The most well-known of those is probably <code>GOTO</code>. With just <code>GOTO</code>, you can build <em>any</em> other control flow construct: <code>IF-THEN-ELSE</code>, <code>WHILE</code>, <code>FOR</code>, <code>REPEAT-UNTIL</code>, <code>FOREACH</code>, exceptions, threads, subroutine calls, method calls, function calls and so on, and of course also coroutines and generators.</p>

<p>Almost all CPUs support <code>GOTO</code> (although in a CPU, they usually call it <code>jmp</code>). In fact, in many CPUs, <code>GOTO</code> is the <em>only</em> control flow construct, although today native support for at least subroutine calls (<code>call</code>) and maybe some primitive form of exception handling and/or concurrency primitive (compare-and-swap) are usually also built in.</p>

<p>Another well-known control flow primitive are continuations. Continuations are basically a more structured, better manageable and less evil variant of <code>GOTO</code>, especially popular in functional languages. But there also some low-level languages that base their control flow on continuations, for example the Parrot Virtual Machine uses continuations for control flow and I believe there are even some continuation-based CPUs in some research lab somewhere.</p>

<p>C has a sort-of ""crappy"" form of continuations (<code>setjmp</code> and <code>longjmp</code>), that are much less powerful and less easy to use than ""real"" continuations, but they are plenty powerful enough to implement generators (and in fact, can be used to implement full continuations).</p>

<p>On a Unix platform, <code>setcontext</code> can be used as a more powerful and higher level alternative to <code>setjmp</code>/<code>longjmp</code>.</p>

<p>Another control flow construct that is well-known, but doesn't probably spring to mind as a low-level substrate build <em>other</em> control flow constructs on top of, are exceptions. There is a paper that shows that exceptions can be more powerful than continuations, thus making exceptions essentially equivalent to <code>GOTO</code> and thus universally powerful. And, in fact, exceptions <em>are</em> sometimes used as universal control flow constructs: the Microsoft Volta project, which compiled .NET bytecode to JavaScript, used JavaScript exceptions to implement .NET threads and generators.</p>

<p>Not universal, but probably powerful enough to implement generators is just plain tail call optimization. (I might be wrong, though. I unfortunately don't have a proof.) I <em>think</em> you can transform a generator into a set of mutually tail-recursive functions. I know that state machines can be implemented using tail calls, so I'm pretty sure generators can, too, since, after all, C# implements generators as state machines. (I think this works especially well together with lazy evaluation.)</p>

<p>Last but not least, in a language with a reified call stack (like most Smalltalks for example), you can build pretty much any kind of control flow constructs you want. (In fact, a reified call stack is basically the procedural low-level equivalent to the functional high-level continuation.)</p>

<p>So, what <em>do</em> other implementations of generators look like?</p>

<p>Lua doesn't have generators per se, but it has full asymmetric coroutines. The main C implementation uses <code>setjmp</code>/<code>longjmp</code> to implement them.</p>

<p>Ruby also doesn't have generators per se, but it has <code>Enumerator</code>s, that can be used as generators. <code>Enumerator</code>s are not part of the language, they are a library feature. MRI implements <code>Enumerator</code>s using continuations, which in turn are implemented using <code>setjmp</code>/<code>longjmp</code>. YARV implements <code>Enumerator</code>s using <code>Fiber</code>s (which is how Ruby spells ""coroutines""), and <em>those</em> are implemented using <code>setjmp</code>/<code>longjmp</code>. I believe JRuby currently implements <code>Enumerator</code>s using threads, but they want to switch to something better as soon as the JVM gains some better control flow constructs.</p>

<p>Python has generators that are actually more or less full-blown coroutines. CPython implements them using <code>setjmp</code>/<code>longjmp</code>.</p>

"<p>I need to parse C#, Ruby and Python source code to generate some reports. I need to get a list of method names inside a class, and I need some other info such as usage of global variable or something. Just parsing using RE could be a solution, but I expect a better (systematic) solution using parsers, if it is easily possible. </p>

<p>What parsers for those languages are provided?</p>

<p>For C#, I found <a href=""http://csparser.codeplex.com/Wikipage"" rel=""nofollow"">http://csparser.codeplex.com/Wikipage</a> , but for the others, I found a bunch of parsers using those languages, but not the language parsers of them.</p>
","2988","","<p>For Python, the situation is trivial: there is a <a href=""http://Docs.Python.Org/library/parser.html"">Python parser</a> in the standard library as well as <a href=""http://Docs.Python.Org/library/ast.html"">a more high-level module for manipulating ASTs</a>.</p>

<p>Also, Python has a somewhat simple grammar (at least if you use the trick to keep an indentation stack in your lexer and inject fake <code>BEGIN</code> and <code>END</code> tokens in your token stream, so that you can treat Python as a simple keyword delimited Algol-like language in your parser), so it is often used as an example grammar for parser generators, which means that you can find literally dozens of Python parsers for pretty much every single parser generator, programming language and platform out there. (E.g., here is <a href=""http://Projects.Haskell.Org/language-python/"">a Haskell module implementing a Python lexer and parser</a>.)</p>

<p>For Ruby, there are quite a number of parsers available.</p>

<p>Ruby is <em>incredibly</em> hard to parse, so if you need full fidelity, you pretty much have to use the original YACC grammar file from the YARV Ruby implementation. (<a href=""https://GitHub.Com/Ruby/Ruby/blob/trunk/parse.y""><code>parse.y</code> in the top-level source directory.</a>) JRuby's parser is derived from that file, and it is the only one of the implementation parsers that has been explicitly designed to also be used by <em>other</em> clients and not just the interpreter itself. (For example, the Eclipse RDT plugin, the Eclipse DLTK/Ruby plugin, the NetBeans Ruby plugin and the jEdit Ruby syntax highlighting all use JRuby's parser.) To facilitate that, JRuby's parser has actually been repackaged as a <a href=""http://JRuby-Parser.Kenai.Com/"">separate project</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, there are YACC clones for pretty much every language on the planet. However, be aware that YARV does not use a <code>lex</code> generated scanner. It uses a hand-written scanner in C, and also the YACC grammar contains quite a bit of semantic actions in C. Those parts will have to be re-implemented (like they were in JRuby).</p>

<p>The XRuby compiler is the only full Ruby implementation that does not use YARV's <code>parse.y</code>, it uses <a href=""https://GitHub.Com/RhoMobile/Rhodes/blob/master/platform/shared/xruby/src/com/xruby/compiler/parser/ruby.g"">an ANTLRv3 grammar</a> and an <a href=""https://GitHub.Com/RhoMobile/Rhodes/blob/master/platform/shared/xruby/src/com/xruby/compiler/parser/ruby.tree.g"">ANTLRv3 tree grammar</a> that have been developed from scratch. ANTLR can generate parsers for a whole bunch of languages, including for example Java and C#. Its Ruby backend, however, is in dire need of some work.</p>

<p><a href=""http://RedParse.RubyForge.Org/"">RedParse</a> is a Ruby parser written in Ruby, which claims to be able to parse all Ruby syntax correctly. It is used, for example, in the <a href=""http://YARDoc.Org/"">YARD</a> Ruby documentation tool to, among other things, extract method names.</p>

<p><a href=""http://ParseTree.RubyForge.Org/"">ruby_parser</a> is another Ruby parser in Ruby. It is generated from <code>parse.y</code> via the <code>racc</code> parser generator that is part of Ruby's standard library.</p>

<p>YARV actually contains a parser library called <code>ripper</code>, which allows you to parse Ruby code. Unfortunately, it is completely undocumented, so you basically have to figure it out by reading <a href=""http://ArtWeb-Design.De/2009/7/5/using-ruby-1-9-ripper/"">blog posts</a>. Except of course, being undocumented, almost nobody <em>else</em> has figured it out yet, either and written a blog post.</p>

<p>However, for your purposes, you don't actually need a full-blown Ruby parser. You only need enough to extract method names and some other stuff.</p>

<p><a href=""http://RDoc.RubyForge.Org/"">RDoc</a>, the Ruby documentation generator, contains a Ruby parser which can parse just enough Ruby to, well, extract method names and some other stuff.</p>

<p><a href=""https://GitHub.Com/Cardinal/"">Cardinal</a> is a Ruby implementation for the <a href=""http://ParrotCode.Org/"">Parrot Virtual Machine</a>. It does not yet run all of Ruby, but <a href=""https://GitHub.Com/Cardinal/Cardinal/blob/master/src/parser/grammar.pg"">its parser</a> should be powerful enough to support all you need. (The parser is written in the Parrot Grammar Engine, so you will obviously have to run it in Parrot, by for example writing your reporting tool in Perl6.)</p>

In both cases, the language designers felt that the language should be a compelling user interface, and thus they paid very close attention to even the smallest details, like the naming of parameters in method signatures.</p>

<p>Method signatures themselves are fairly unusual in Smalltalk (and Objective-C), in that the arguments and parameters are <em>not</em> written <em>after</em> the name (as in pretty much every other language ever invented), but rather the name of the method gets broken up into pieces and the arguments and parameters go <em>between</em> them. This makes for some strange looking method names, but when you read the <em>entire</em> signature with the arguments or parameters, then it reads almost like a sentence in the domain jargon of whatever domain that particular method operates in.</p>

<p>So, in some run of the mill OO language, a method for storing a value at a particular index in an array might look like this:</p>

<pre><code>store(i, obj)
</code></pre>

<p>or even worse, like this:</p>

<pre><code>public void store(int i, T obj)
</code></pre>

<p>or this:</p>

<pre><code>store(self, i, obj)
</code></pre>

<p>er even this (from <em>my</em> favorite language):</p>

<pre><code>[]=(i, obj)
</code></pre>

<p>(How do you even pronounce that?)</p>

<p>and might be called like this:</p>

<pre><code>ary.store(3, ""Hello"")
</code></pre>

<p>or this:</p>

<pre><code>ary[3] = ""Hello""
</code></pre>

<p>or <em>maybe</em> with little bit less punctuation (in Io and Ioke, for example):</p>

<pre><code>ary store(3, ""Hello"")
</code></pre>

<p>In Smalltalk, the signature looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>at: anInteger put: anObject
</code></pre>

<p>and it is called like this:</p>

<pre><code>anArray at: 3 put: ""Hello"".
</code></pre>

<p>If you read the signature out loud, it becomes clear that there simply <em>has</em> to be an indefinite article there, otherwise it just wouldn't read right.</p>

<p>Note some of the differences: in the mainstream versions, parameters are only distinguished by their positions. So, in order to figure out what they mean, you give them descriptive names. But when you actually <em>call</em> the method, those descriptive names are gone, because the parameters get replaced with the arguments. (And yes, I am well aware that <code>i</code> isn't exactly a descriptive name. If you want to, you can repeat the experiment with something like <code>copy(source, destination)</code> and <code>copyFrom: aDirectory to: anotherDirectory</code>).</p>

<p>In the Smalltalk example, however, the semantics of the parameter are encoded in the method name, thus freeing up the parameter name for other usages. In this case, type annotations (since Smalltalk is implicitly typed) or, well, basically some form of Hungarian Notation. Also, when you call the method, the encoded meaning is still there in the method name. (In the example above, when you read <code>copy(a, b)</code>, you don't know whether this is copying from <code>a</code> to <code>b</code> or the other way round, but with <code>copyFrom: a to: b.</code> there is no ambiguity. You could fix that by renaming the method: <code>copyFromTo(a, b)</code>, but that doesn't read very well, either.)</p>

<p>Now, in Objective-C, all of this gets a little lost, because of the type annotations. Compare these two signatures, which basically describe the same method:</p>

<pre><code>at: anInteger put: anObject
- (void)insertObject:(id)anObject atIndex:(NSUInteger)index
</code></pre>

<p>Somehow, the ""read it out loud as an English sentence"" part got lost, but the ""an"" prefix for <code>anObject</code> is still there.</p>

<p>Anyway, to make a long story short: the reason for those prefixes has to do with Objective-C's heritage.</p>

"<p>I've heard that given a programmer with enough time and skill in any particular language and enough lines of code, then any program could be created with any given language. I know its certainly not going to be cost-efficient, for instance, to rewrite Adobe Photoshop in BASIC, but could a good enough and patient enough programmer potentially create any program in any language?</p>
","2988","","<p>This depends on exactly how you define ""any program"" and ""any language"".</p>

<p>Let's start with the first one: ""any program"". There are many programs (in fact, there are <em>infinitely many</em> programs) that cannot be written <em>at all</em>, regardless of the programming language. One of the most famous ones is the so-called Halting Problem: write a program <code>H</code>, which when given any program <code>P</code> and any input <code>x</code> determines whether <code>P(x)</code> will eventually halt. Alan Turing proved many decades ago that it is <em>impossible</em> for such a program to exist. Ergo, you cannot write this program in <em>any</em> programming language.</p>

<p>Now, let's talk about ""any language"". There are actually different classes of languages. Some are more powerful than others. For example regular expressions (which <em>are</em> a kind of programming language) can <em>not</em> compute any arbitrary function. They are limited in their computational power. However, most general purpose programming languages are what is generally called ""Turing-complete"".</p>

<p>Brief bit of history: in order to prove the undecidability of the Halting Problem, Alan Turing invented a hypothetical machine called the Turing Machine. A TM is basically a hypothetical computer with infinite memory, that computes a particular function. It turns out that you can build a Universal Turing Machine which can emulate <em>any</em> other Turing Machine.</p>

<p>At about the same time, Alonzo Church invented the Lambda Calculus. The LC is <em>also</em> an abstract mathematical model of computation, but <em>completely</em> different. People started wondering: which of those two models is more powerful? Is there anything that a UTM can compute that LC cannot and vice versa? Can the LC solve the Halting Problem?</p>

<p>As it turns out, you can write an emulator for a UTM in LC and you can build a TM which interprets LC. This means that a TM can compute everything LC can compute (by simply running it in the interpreter) and LC can compute everything a UTM can compute (by simply running it in the emulator). So, we have</p>

<pre><code>LC ≤ UTM ∧ UTM ≤ LC ⇒ LC = UTM
</code></pre>

<p>In English: LC and UTM are exactly equally powerful. In fact, it turns out that <em>every</em> model of computation and <em>every</em> machine and <em>every</em> programming language we have ever found is <em>at most</em> as powerful as LC and UTM and indeed <em>every other</em> model. This leads to the so-called <em>Church-Turing-Thesis</em> which states all sufficiently powerful models of computation are equally powerful and there can be no model of computation that is more powerful than UTM or LC. (There can be models of computation that are <em>less</em> powerful, like for example regular expressions or total functions or a language with only bounded loops.)</p>

<p>We call such models of computation <em>Turing-complete</em>. And, BTW, <a href=""http://StackOverflow.Com/questions/1053931/"">you don't need much to be Turing-complete</a>.</p>

<p>So, with that out of the way, we can now define what we mean by ""any program"" and ""any language"":</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If a program can be written <em>in one Turing-complete language</em>, then it can be written in <em>any Turing-complete language</em>.</p>

","2988","","<p>Ruby is strictly pass-by-value. Always. But sometimes those values are poointers.</p>

<p>Here's a couple of links:</p>

</ul>

<p>Note that while all of these say ""Java"", they should really say ""Smalltalk and its descendants"", which includes Java, Ruby and a ton of other languages.</p>

<p>I think most of the confusion stems from two problems:</p>

<ol>
<li>Ruby passes references by value. But the word ""reference"" in that sentence is not the same as the word ""reference"" in ""pass-by-reference"". Maybe it is clearer when we disambiguate: let's replace ""pass-by-reference"" with ""pass-by-variable"" and ""reference"" with ""pointer"" (note that these are ""good"" well-behaved poointers, not the ""bad"" ones from C):
<ul>
<li>Fortran is pass-by-variable</li>
<li>Ruby is pass-by-value and the values it passes are mostly poointers</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The references (poointers) that Ruby passes point to mutable objects. Therefore, while you <em>cannot</em> change the reference, you <em>can</em> mutate the objects that the reference points to. The problem here is that Ruby (like most imperative object-oriented languages) confuses the concepts of identity, state and value. You can learn more about that problem and how to fix it here (Note that while they say ""Clojure"", the concepts that are presented are universal and could be applied equally well to OO):
<ul>

</ol>

<p>BTW: I deliberately misspelt ""poointers"" with an OO for object-orientation to make it clear that I am not talking about raw memory addresses, I am talking about opaque references to objects (and for obvious reasons I do not want to use the word ""reference""; if you know a better word that is neither ""pointer"" nor ""reference"", I'd love to hear it).</p>

"<p>I have a situation where I would like to have objects of a certain type be able to be used as two different types.  If one of the ""base"" types was an interface this wouldn't be an issue, but in my case it is preferable that they both be concrete types.</p>

<p>I am considering adding copies of the methods and properties of one of the base types to the derived type, and adding an implicit conversion from the derived type to that base type.  Then users will be able treat the derived type as the base type by using the duplicated methods directly, by assigning it to a variable of the base type, or by passing it to a method that takes the base type.</p>

<p>It seems like this solution will fit my needs well, but am I missing anything?  Is there a situation where this won't work, or where it is likely to add confusion instead of simplicity when using the API?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> More details about my specific scenario:</p>

<p>This is for a potential future redesign of the way indicators are written in <a href=""http://www.rightedgesystems.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">RightEdge</a>, which is an automated trading system development environment.  Price data is represented as a series of bars, which have values for the open, low, high, and close prices for a given period (1 minute, 1 day, etc).  Indicators perform calculations on series of data.  An example of a simple indicator is the moving average indicator, which gives the moving average of the most recent <em>n</em> values of its input, where <em>n</em> is user-specified.  The moving average might be applied to the bar close, or it could be applied to the output of another indicator to smooth it out.</p>

<p>Each time a new bar comes in, the indicators compute the new value for their output for that bar.</p>

<p>Most indicators have only one output series, but sometimes it is convenient to have more than one output (see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MACD"" rel=""nofollow"">MACD</a>), and I want to support this.</p>

<p>So, indicators need to derive from a ""Component"" class which has the methods that are called when new data comes in.  However, for indicators which have only one output series (and this is most of them), it would be good for them to act as a series themselves.  That way, users can use <code>SMA.Current</code> for the current value of an SMA, instead of having to use <code>SMA.Output.Current</code>.  Likewise, <code>Indicator2.Input = Indicator1;</code> is preferable to <code>Indicator2.Input = Indicator1.Output;</code>.  This may not seem like much of a difference, but a lot of our target customers are not professional .NET developers so I want to make this as easy as possible.</p>

<p>My idea is to have an implicit conversion from the indicator to its output series for indicators that have only one output series.</p>
","2988","","<p>This might be a stupid idea, but: if your design requires multiple inheritance, then why don't you simply use a language with MI? There are several .NET languages which support multiple inheritance. Off the top of my head: Eiffel, Python, Ioke. There's probable more.</p>

"<p>When I code, I always write little pieces of unit, and compile it often. This helps me to make sure that everything run correctly, but it's very time consumed. <strong><em>is there any programming language that can support us to do coding and running at the same time side by side ?</em></strong> i mean as soon as a key press leads to valid code, the effect of the edit is incorporated into the executing program.</p>
","2988","","<p>What you are looking for, is sometimes called a lively system, incremental system or self-sustaining system (S³).</p>

<p>It's not really a property of the programming language, it's a poperty of the development environment. The only thing it <em>does</em> have to do with the programming language is that some programming language <em>communities</em> are violently opposed to the very idea of liveliness and thus those communities tend to not produce lively tools, while other communities cannot imagine life without a lively system, so they tend to produce them.</p>

<p>For example, almost all Smalltalk environments and many Lisp environments are lively, while I know of not a single lively C or C++ environment. There used to be a lively Java environment, called IBM Visual Age for Java (which was actually written in Smalltalk by IBM's Smalltalk division and based on IBM Visual for Smalltalk, so there's not really a surprise there), but when it was rewritten in Java as Visual Age for Java Micro Edition (which you probably know better under its current name, Eclipse), it lost its liveliness.</p>

<p>You ask about ""coding and running at the same time side by side"". Well, in a lively system, they aren't even ""side by side"", they are actually one and the same: there is no distinction between coding and running, there is no distinction between IDE and application, there is no distinction between compile time and run time.</p>

<p>The way you often develop software in Smalltalk, is that you simply write down what you want and run it:</p>

<pre><code>aCalculator ← Calculator new.
aCalculator compute: '1 + 1'.
</code></pre>

<p>(BTW: ""Run it"" simply means writing that little snippet of code into <em>any</em> text area anywhere on the screen, highlight it and click ""Run"".)</p>

<p>[Note: left arrow is assignment (think <code>=</code>), upwards arrow is <code>return</code>. Original Smalltalk systems had them on the keyboard, modern systems typically use <code>:=</code> and <code>^</code> instead. Also, whitespace is message sending (""dot"" in Java) and period terminates a sentence (<code>;</code>) in most languages. Arguments to methods are passed inline in the message itself after colons and not in parentheses.]</p>

<p>Of course, this doesn't work, because the <code>Calculator</code> class doesn't exist yet. So, the debugger pops up (did I mention there's no distinction between running and debugging?) and one of the options it offers you is to create that class. You don't restart the program, it just keeps on running. Now you get a <em>new</em> error, because the <code>compute:</code> method doesn't exist. Again, the debugger offers to create the method for you and you can directly enter the code right there: (Did I mention there's no distinction between the debugger and the editor?)</p>

<pre><code>compute: aString
    ↑ 2.
</code></pre>

<p>The system has already filled the method name out for you and chosen a (somewhat) reasonable name for the method parameter. You only have to type the second line.</p>

<p>(BTW: if this workflow sounds familiar to you, it should. Kent Beck based the object model and execution model of his two testing frameworks (SUnit and JUnit), as well as the practices of Test-Driven Development and the Red-Green-Refactor cycle on exactly this workflow.)</p>

<p>Notice that at no time in the process did we stop or restart the running program. We were always editing the source code of the live system from within the system while the system was running. In fact, you actually <em>cannot</em> stop a Smalltalk program or Smalltalk system! Even if you shut down the Smalltalk system, what it actually does is serialize the entire state of the system (every class, every object, every variable, every thread, every window, even the position of the mouse pointer) to disk and when you start it up again, you are <em>exactly</em> where you left off. The system never stopped, it was just frozen. (If you are familiar with VMWare, Parallels, VirtualBox or something like that, it's like taking a snapshot of the VM. Or think of hibernating or suspending your computer.)</p>

<p>In fact, if you download a version of Squeak today, there's probably objects in there that have been literally running for 30 years. (This is another difference between Smalltalk and other systems. Smalltalkers believe that, just like fine wines, objects get better with age. This is in stark contrast to, for example, PHP or Ruby on Rails, where objects get thrown away pretty much after every web request.)</p>

<p>One of the most famous examples of this lively editing is from the pivotal ""Apple Demo"", when Steve Jobs, Jef Raskin and other members of the Lisa team visited Xerox PARC in 1979 to get a demo of the Smalltalk system:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of the best parts of the demo was when Steve Jobs said he didn't like the <code>blt</code>-style scrolling we were using and asked if we cold do it in a smooth continuous style. In less than a minute Dan [Ingalls] found the methods involved, made the (relatively major) changes and scrolling was now continuous! This shocked the visitors, espeicially the programmers among them, as they had never seen a really powerful incremental system before.&mdash;<a href=""http://Smalltalk.Org/smalltalk/TheEarlyHistoryOfSmalltalk_V.html#29"" rel=""nofollow"">The Early History Of Smalltalk by Alan Kay, HOPL-II, &copy;1993 ACM</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh, and yes, you did read that right: Dan Ingalls rewrote the video driver in a live system, from within a live system, without ever rebooting the system or even pausing the application. In less than 60 seconds. (Did I mention there's no distinction between programming language and operating system?)</p>

<p>One of the best explanations of the liveliness properties can be found in the video <a href=""http://Smalltalk.Org.Br/movies/Self_big.mov"" rel=""nofollow""><em>Self; The Movie</em></a> (Self is a derivative of Smalltalk). Also, take a look at the <a href=""http://Lively-Kernel.Org/"" rel=""nofollow""><em>Lively Kernel</em></a> by Dan Ingalls (one of the original designers of Smalltalk), which is basically a port of the Smalltalk ideas to JavaScript, running inside a web page.</p>

<p>As I wrote above, this is really a feature of the environment, not the language. Thus, even though I used Smalltalk here as an example, you could implement a lively system for any language. I already mentioned Lisp as a language for which many lively environments exist and I gave an example for JavaScript. APL and Forth systems tend to be lively as well. <a href=""http://FactorCode.Org/"" rel=""nofollow"">Factor</a> is a nice example of a lively system. The most extreme example might be the VxWorks real-time operating system which contains a semi-lively system for C(!), which has been used to diagnose and fix a priority inversion problem leading to spurious system resets on the Sojourner rover <em>on another friggin' planet!</em></p>

"<p>I don't believe seeing <a href=""http://www.communityforfsharp.net/april-2010-live-meeting-detail"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a>. It says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For April, Chris Smith will be presenting on writing a Java to x86 Compiler in F#.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The presentation may go on for an hour or two which definitely is not enough to write a <em>compiler</em>. I've heard that F# is powerful, but <em>this</em> powerful?</p>

<p>Well, all I wanted to ask is this: Can you write a compiler in F# that quickly?</p>
","2988","","<p>Let's first start with a few corrections:</p>

<ul>
<li>It's not a Java compiler, it's a compiler for a small <em>subset</em> of Java.</li>
<li>It doesn't say anywhere that the compiler will be <em>written</em> in the time, only that it will be <em>explained</em>.</li>
<li>In fact, it doesn't even say that, it says, it will be <em>presented</em>. Heck, I can present GCC in 3 minutes. It's not gonna be a very <em>useful</em> presentation, but it's gonna be a presentation.</li>
</ul>

<p>That said, explaining a well-structured, simple compiler for a simple language implemented in a language which is well-suited for writing compilers within an hour is definitely feasible.</p>

<p>F# is a member of the ML family of languages (specifically, a close cousin of OCaml), and those are indeed well-suited for writing compilers. In fact, the <em>reason</em> why Robin Milner chose the name ML (meta language) for his language, was because it is <em>specifically designed</em> for writing compilers. A compiler is basically a big function (thus making it very natural to implement in a functional language) that detects patterns (thus making it very natural to implement in a language with pattern matching) and executes a little bit of code for each pattern it detects (thus making it very natural to implement in a language with first-class functions). And whaddayaknow? F# is a functional language with very sophisticated pattern matching facilities. Another nice feature is an expressive type system with algebraic data types and discriminated unions which makes it very easy to represent Abstract Syntax Trees.</p>

<p>At the Lang.NET Symposium Jason Olson gave <a href=""http://LangNETSymposium.Com/2009/talks/24-JasonOlson-FSharp.html"">a talk on F#</a>, during which he showed some pieces of an interpreter that he is currently working on that demonstrate these features very well.</p>

"<p>I am currently working through the Gregory Brown <a href=""http://rubybestpractices.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Ruby Best Practices</a> book. Early on, he is talking about refactoring some functionality from helper methods on a related class, to some methods on module, then had the module <code>extend self</code>. </p>

<p>Hadn't seen that before, after a quick google, found out that <code>extend self</code> on a module lets methods defined on the module see each other, which makes sense.</p>

<p>Now, my question is when would you do something like this</p>

<pre><code>module StyleParser
  extend self

  def process(text)
    ...

<pre><code>class StyleParser

  def self.process(text)
    ...
  end

  def self.style_tag?(text)
    ...
  end
end 
</code></pre>

<p>is it so that you can use it as a mixin? or are there other reasons I'm not seeing?</p>
","2988","","<p>In this particular case I would probably user neither a class nor a module.</p>

<p>A class is a factory for objects (note the plural). If you don't want to create multiple instances of the class, there is no need for it to exist.</p>

<p>A module is a container for methods, shared among multiple objects. If you don't mix in the module into multiple objects, there is no need for it to exist.</p>

<p>In this case, it looks like you just want an object. So use one:</p>

<pre><code>def (StyleParser = Object.new).process(text)
  ...
end

def StyleParser.style_tag?(text)
  ...
end
</code></pre>

<p>Or alternatively:</p>

  <p>Hello, i have some problem with creating a function to my Rails app.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Uh oh, right there we run into our first misunderstanding: Ruby is not a <em>functional</em> programming language. It is an <em>object-oriented</em> programming language. There is no such thing as a function in Ruby. Ruby only has <em>methods</em> that live on <em>classes</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>str = 'string here'
puts ""It's within the range!"" if str.within_range?(3..30)
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Here we can see that you obviously intend to have your method available on string objects. In order for your method to be available on string objects, it needs to be defined on the <code>String</code> class (or any of its ancestors).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To do that i added this into my application helper:</p>

<pre><code>def within_range?(range)
  if is_a?(String)
    range.include?(size)
  elsif is_a?(Integer)
    range.include?(self) 
  end
end
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Here, you are adding the <code>within_range?</code> method to the anymous top-level object and not to the <code>String</code> class. Adding a method to the anymous top-level object, also makes it ""magically"" available as a private method on the <code>Object</code> class which is the superclass of (almost) all classes. Therefore, <code>within_range?</code> is now available on all objects, but it is private, so you can only call it with an implicit receiver.</p>

<p>Which is why I don't understand why you are getting this error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But i get this error:</p>

<pre><code>undefined method `within_range?' for """":String
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>There's two things wrong here: first, the object that Ruby reports the error on should be <code>""string here"":String</code>, not <code>"""":String</code>. This means that you were actually calling the <code>within_range?</code> method on an <em>empty</em> string and <em>not</em> on the string <code>'string here'</code> as your code sample shows. Which means that <em>somewhere else</em> in your code base, <em>before</em> the code sample that you posted here, <code>within_range?</code> <em>already</em> gets called on an empty string.</p>

<p>The second problem is that you are getting the totally <em>wrong</em> error message. Ruby tells you that Ruby couldn't find a <code>within_range?</code> method for strings, i.e. that there is no <code>within_range?</code> method on the <code>String</code> class or any of its superclasses including <code>Object</code>. But there <em>should</em> be! You <em>did</em> (although accidentally) define a private method on <code>Object</code>. The error message that you <em>should</em> be getting is this:</p>

<pre><code>NoMethodError: private method `within_range?' called for ""string here"":String
</code></pre>

<p>This means that the code that defines the method never actually got executed. I am not familiar enough with Ruby on Rails to diagnose why that may be the case, though.</p>

<p>But now on to the contents of the code itself. Like I hinted at above, you need to add this code to the <code>String</code> class. And actually, <em>inside</em> your method, you are dealing with both strings and integers, so you need to add the code to a common superclass of <code>String</code> and <code>Integer</code> and there is only one and that is <code>Object</code>:</p>

<pre><code>class Object
  def within_range?(range)
    if    is_a?(String)  then range.include?(size)
    elsif is_a?(Integer) then range.include?(self) end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>[I took the liberty of removing a couple of extra parentheses, <code>self</code>s and newlines.]</p>

<p>There are a couple of problems with this. First: <code>is_a?</code> in Ruby is a Code Smell. It almost always means that you are either doing something wrong or at least something ""un-Rubyish"", like trying to re-implement static typing. (Don't get me wrong: I like static typing, but if I need it, I use a more appropriate language than Ruby.)</p>

<p>In general, if you find yourself using <code>is_a?</code> or its cousins <code>kind_of?</code> and <code>Module#===</code>, you should take a step back and reconsider your design.</p>

<p>Another problem with your code is that you have a condition that examines <code>self</code>. This is even easier to see when we refactor the code to use a <code>case</code> expression instead of an <code>if</code> expression:</p>

<pre><code>class Object
  def within_range?(range)
    case self
    when String  then range.include?(size)
    when Integer then range.include?(self) end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Here, it is easy to see that the object is looking at itself. It should <em>never</em> need to do that! It should always already know everything there is to know about itself. That's as if you had to look in the mirror to know what you are wearing: you shouldn't need to do that, after all you put the clothes on yourself! (And if you need to do that, it is probably the result of some bad decision the night before, just like in programming ...)</p>

<p>A third smell here is the fact that you are doing different things, depending on the type of an object. That's exactly what polymorphism is for: if you say <code>foo.bar</code>, Ruby will call a different version of <code>bar</code>, depending on what the type of <code>foo</code> is. There's no need for you to re-implement this yourself, it's already there.</p>

<p>So, let's step back: what is the method actually doing? Well, if it's called on a string, then it does one thing and if it's called on an integer, it does another thing. So, we are lazy and let Ruby do the work of figuring out which of the two to run:</p>

<pre><code>class String
  def within_range?(range)
    range.include?(size)
  end
end

class Integer
  def within_range?(range)
    range.include?(self)
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>This is already much simpler and much clearer. And there is another advantage: now, if you call <code>within_range?</code> on an object that it doesn't know about, it will actually <em>tell</em> you that it doesn't know what to do by raising a <code>NoMethodError</code>:</p>

<pre><code>[].within_range?(3..30)
# =&gt; NoMethodError: undefined method `within_range?' for []:Array
</code></pre>

<p>The old version was missing an <code>else</code> clause, so it would have just returned <code>nil</code> which evaluates to <code>false</code> in a boolean context, which means that the error would probably have gone undetected.</p>

<p>There is even more we can do: there is actually nothing here that restricts the method from only working with whole numbers, it could just as easily work with floating point numbers, rationals or even complex numbers. So, instead of defining the second method on <code>Integer</code>, we could instead define it on <code>Numeric</code>.</p>

<p>But if you think about it: there actually isn't even anything that requires it to be a number <em>at all</em>, it could in fact be <em>any object</em>, so we could even define it on <code>Object</code>.</p>

<p>This brings me to the last two problems I have with this method, which are related to each other: I think the name for the <code>String</code> version is misleading, and I don't like that the method does completely different things despite its name being the same.</p>

<p>For an integer (or <em>any</em> object, if we define the method on <code>Object</code>), the method checks whether or not the integer (or object) <em>itself</em> is within the range. But for a string, the method <em>does not</em> check whether or not the string <em>itself</em> is within the range, rather it checks whether the <em>length</em> of the string is within the range. This is completely non-obvious and surprising to me:</p>

<pre><code>  2.within_range?(1..3)     # =&gt; true
'B'.within_range?('A'..'C') # =&gt; false
</code></pre>

<p>I, and I suspect pretty much everybody else who reads that piece of code, would expect <em>both</em> of those to be <code>true</code>. The fact that <code>B</code> is not between <code>A</code> and <code>C</code> is completely confusing.</p>

<p>That's what I meant above: the method does two different things despite having the same name. Also, in the case of the string, the method name implies that it checks whether the string is within a certain range, but it actually checks whether the string <em>length</em> is within an certain range, and there is absolutely no indication in the method name that this is the case.</p>

<p>A much better name would be <code>length_within_range?</code>, and you would call it like so:</p>

<pre><code>'B'.length_within_range?(1..2) # =&gt; true
'B'.within_range?('A'..'C')    # =&gt; true
</code></pre>

<p>[Assuming that <code>within_range?</code> is defined on <code>Object</code>.]</p>

<p>This makes it very clear to everyone reading the code that we are comparing the <em>length</em> of the string and not the string itself.</p>

<p>However, now there really isn't much difference between</p>

<pre><code>str.length_within_range?(3..30)
str.length.within_range?(3..30)
</code></pre>

<p>Which means we can get rid of the string version altogether, leaving us only with the <code>Object</code> version.</p>

<p>The <code>Object</code> version, in turn, doesn't really do anything except flipping argument and receiver around, so we might just as well write</p>

<pre><code>(3..30).include?(str.length)
</code></pre>

<p>and get rid of the whole thing altogether.</p>

","2988","","<p>Ruby doesn't have metaclasses. There are some constructs in Ruby which some people sometimes wrongly call metaclasses but they aren't (which is a source of <em>endless</em> confusion).</p>

<p>However, there's a lot of ways to achieve the same results in Ruby that you would do with metaclasses. But without telling us what exactly you want to do, there's no telling what those mechanisms might be.</p>

<p>In short:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ruby doesn't have metaclasses</li>
<li>Ruby doesn't have any one construct that corresponds to Python's metaclasses</li>
<li>Everything that Python can do with metaclasses can also be done in Ruby</li>
<li>But there is no <em>single</em> construct, you will use different constructs depending on what exactly you want to do</li>
<li>Any one of those constructs probably has other features as well that do not correspond to metaclasses (although they probably correspond to something <em>else</em> in Python)</li>
<li>While you can do anything in Ruby that you can do with metaclasses in Python, it might not necessarily be straightforward</li>
<li>Although often there will be a more Rubyish solution that <em>is</em> elegant</li>
<li>Last but not least: while you can do anything in Ruby that you can do with metaclasses in Python, doing it might not necessarily be The Ruby Way</li>
</ul>

<p>So, what <em>are</em> metaclasses exactly? Well, they are classes of classes. So, let's take a step back: what are <em>classes</em> exactly?</p>

<p>Classes &hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li>are factories for objects</li>
<li>define the behavior of objects</li>
<li>define on a metaphysical level what it means to be an instance of the class</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, the <code>Array</code> class produces array objects, defines the behavior of arrays and defines what ""array-ness"" means.</p>

<p>Back to metaclasses.</p>

<p>Metaclasses &hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li>are factories for classes</li>
<li>define the behavior of classes</li>
<li>define on a metaphysical level what it means to be a class</li>
</ul>

<p>In Ruby, those three responsibilities are split across three different places:</p>

<ul>
<li>the <code>Class</code> class creates classes and defines a little bit of the behavior</li>
<li>the individual class's eigenclass defines a little bit of the behavior of the class</li>
<li>the concept of ""classness"" is hardwired into the interpreter, which also implements the bulk of the behavior (for example, you cannot inherit from <code>Class</code> to create a new kind of class that looks up methods differently, or something like that&nbsp;&ndash; the method lookup algorithm is hardwired into the interpreter)</li>
</ul>

<p>So, those three things together play the role of metaclasses, but neither one of those is a metaclass (each one only implements a small part of what a metaclass does), nor is the <em>sum</em> of those the metaclass (because they do much more than that).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, some people call eigenclasses of classes metaclasses. (Until recently, I was one of those misguided souls, until I finally saw the light.) Other people call <em>all</em> eigenclasses metaclasses. (Unfortunately, one of those people is the author of one the most popular tutorials on Ruby metaprogramming and the Ruby object model.) Some popular libraries add a <code>metaclass</code> method to <code>Object</code> that returns the object's eigenclass (e.g. ActiveSupport, Facets, metaid). Some people call <em>all</em> virtual classes (i.e. eigenclasses and include classes) metaclasses. Some people call <code>Class</code> the metaclass. Even within the Ruby source code itself, the word ""metaclass"" is used to refer to things that are not metaclasses.</p>

","2988","","<p>Your updated question looks quite different now. If I understand you correctly, you want to hook into object allocation and initialization, which has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with metaclasses. (But you <em>still</em> don't write what it is that you actually want to do, so I might still be off.)</p>

<p>In some object-oriented languages, objects are created by constructors. However, Ruby doesn't have constructors. Constructors are just factory methods (with stupid restrictions); there is no reason to have them in a well-designed language, if you can just use a (more powerful) factory method instead.</p>

<p>Object construction in Ruby works like this: object construction is split into two phases, <em>allocation</em> and <em>initialization</em>. Allocation is done by a public class method called <code>allocate</code>, which is defined as an instance method of class <code>Class</code> and is generally <em>never</em> overriden. (In fact, I don't think you actually <em>can</em> override it.) It just allocates the memory space for the object and sets up a few pointers, however, the object is not really usable at this point.</p>

<p>That's where the initializer comes in: it is an instance method called <code>initialize</code>, which sets up the object's internal state and brings it into a consistent, fully defined state which can be used by other objects.</p>

<p>So, in order to fully create a new object, what you need to do is this:</p>

<pre><code>x = X.allocate
x.initialize
</code></pre>

<p>[Note: Objective-C programmers may recognize this.]</p>

<p>However, because it is too easy to forget to call <code>initialize</code> and as a general rule an object should be fully valid after construction, there is a convenience factory method called <code>Class#new</code>, which does all that work for you and looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>class Class
  def new(*args, &amp;block)
    obj = allocate
    obj.initialize(*args, &amp;block)

    return obj
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>[Note: actually, <code>initialize</code> is private, so reflection has to be used to circumvent the access restrictions like this: <code>obj.send(:initialize, *args, &amp;block)</code>]</p>

<p>That, by the way, is the reason why to construct an object you <em>call</em> a public class method <code>Foo.new</code> but you <em>implement</em> a private instance method <code>Foo#initialize</code>, which seems to trip up a lot of newcomers.</p>

<p>However, <em>none</em> of this is in any way baked into the language. The fact that the primary factory method for any class is usually called <code>new</code> is just a convention (and sometimes I wish it were different, because it looks similar to constructors in Java, but is <em>completely</em> different). In other languages, the constructor must have a specific name. In Java, it must have the same name as the class, which means that a) there can be only one constructor and b) anonymous classes can't have constructors because they don't have names. In Python, the factory method must be called <code>__new__</code>, which again means there can be only one. (In both Java and Python, you can of course have different factory methods, but calling them looks different from calling the default, while in Ruby (and Smalltalk from whence this pattern originated) it looks just the same.)</p>

<p>In Ruby, there can be as many factory methods as you like, with any name you like, and a factory method can have many different names. (For collection classes, for example, the factory method is often aliased to <code>[]</code>, which allows you to write <code>List[1, 2, 3]</code> instead of <code>List.new(1, 2, 3)</code> which ends looking more like an array, thus emphasizing the collection-ish nature of lists.)</p>

<p>In short:</p>

<ul>
<li>the standardized factory method is <code>Foo.new</code>, but it can be anything</li>
<li><code>Foo.new</code> calls <code>allocate</code> to allocate memory for an empty object <code>foo</code></li>
<li><code>Foo.new</code> then calls <code>foo.initialize</code>, i.e. the <code>Foo#initialize</code> instance method</li>
<li>all three of those are just methods like any other, which you can undefine, redefine, override, wrap, alias and whatnot</li>
<li>well, except <code>allocate</code> which needs to allocate memory inside the Ruby runtime which you can't really do from Ruby</li>
</ul>

<p>In Python, <code>__new__</code> roughly corresponds to both <code>new</code> and <code>allocate</code> in Ruby, and <code>__init__</code> <em>exactly</em> corresponds to <code>initialize</code> in Ruby. The main difference is that in Ruby, <code>new</code> calls <code>initialize</code> whereas in Python, the <em>runtime</em> automatically calls <code>__init__</code> after <code>__new__</code>.</p>

<p>For example, here is a class which only allows a maximum of 2 instances created:</p>

<pre><code>class Foo
  def self.new(*args, &amp;block)
    @instances ||= 0
    raise 'Too many instances!' if @instances &gt;= 2

    obj = allocate
    obj.send(:initialize, *args, &amp;block)

    @instances += 1

    return obj
  end

  attr_reader :name

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end
end

one = Foo.new('#1')
two = Foo.new('#2')
puts two.name         # =&gt; #2
three = Foo.new('#3') # =&gt; RuntimeError: Too many instances!

</ul>

<p>Of those, the most interesting are Klein and Maxine (whose design is actually based on Klein). Metacircular Lisp and Scheme implementations usually assume the existence of some basic primitive special forms, which then have to be implemented in assembler, C or a limited subset of the language in a low-level style. Squeak and PyPy use a limited subset of the language. Jikes uses ""magic"" methods and low-level style.</p>

<p>The idea of Klein and Maxine is that <em>everything</em> is written in high-level, object-oriented, expressive, idiomatic style. In the current version of Klein, there are only two tiny places where the style is hampered by some restriction: in the implementation of message sending, you cannot send any messages and in the implementation of object cloning you cannot clone any objects. However, the current compiler <em>can</em> actually inline or even completely optimize away object cloning and message sending, so those two places could be rewritten in normal OO Self style&nbsp;&ndash; it's just that nobody has done it yet.</p>

"<p>Hey,Everyone!
   the question is that the title say! who can tell me how do this in ruby!</p>
","2988","","<p>With Ruby 1.9, that's particularly easy, because all strings carry their encoding with them:</p>

<pre><code># coding: UTF-8

u = 'µ'
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, the string is encoded as UTF-8:</p>

<pre><code>p u.encoding   # =&gt; #&lt;Encoding:UTF-8&gt;
p u.bytes.to_a # =&gt; [194, 181]

<p>Transcoding the string is quite easy:</p>

p i.bytes.to_a # =&gt; [181]
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to write to a file, the network, an IO stream or the console, it gets even easier. In Ruby 1.9, those objects are tagged with an encoding just like strings are, and transcoding happens automatically. Just say <code>print</code> or <code>puts</code> and Ruby will do the transcoding for you:</p>

<li>most Pascal compilers are written in Pascal, </li>
<li>most Oberon compilers are written in Oberon, </li>
<li>both the 6g/8g and the gccgo Go compilers are written in C.</li>
</ul>

<p>In general, compilers can be written in <em>any</em> language that is actually powerful enough to write a compiler in. This obviously includes any Turing-complete language. But it might even be possible to write a compiler in a non-Turing-complete language. (For example, I don't see any obvious reason why a compiler couldn't be a total function, but total functions are obviously not Turing-complete.)</p>

<p>In practice, however, compilers are mostly written in three specific classes of languages with different pros and cons:</p>

<ol>
<li>the same language that the compiler implements (pros: larger community, because everybody who knows the language can work on the compiler, otherwise they would need to know both languages; cons: the bootstrap problem)</li>
<li>the primary low-level systems programming language of the platform the compiler is supposed to run on, e.g. C on Unix, Java on the JVM, C# on the CLI (pros: very fast; cons: oftentimes those languages are simply not very good for writing compilers, also I don't actually believe that the performance benefits are real)</li>
<li>a language that is very good for writing compilers like ML, Haskell, Lisp, Scheme (pros: those compilers tend to be very easy to understand and hack on; cons: you still need to know both languages)
<ol>
<li>special case of the above: a domain-specific language for writing compilers, like OMeta or for the parsing frontend ANTLR, YACC (pros: same as above but even more so; cons: same as above)</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<p>All of these are essentially tradeoffs: writing the compiler in the same language makes it easier to understand, because you don't have to learn another language. It can also make it harder to understand because the language isn't actually very good at writing compilers. (Imagine, for example, writing a SQL compiler in SQL.) It might even be <em>impossible</em> to write a compiler, for example (for a pretty loose definition of ""language"" and ""compiler"") it is impossible to write a CSS compiler in CSS or an HTML compiler in HTML.</p>

<p>On the opposite side: writing the compiler in a specialized compiler-writing language probably makes it easier to understand, but at the same time it requires you to learn a new language.</p>

<p>Note that the three classes are not disjoint: a compiler can fall into more than one class. For example, a compiler for a specialized compiler-writing language, written in itself falls both into category 1 (written in itself) and 3 (written in a language good at writing compilers).</p>

<p>In some cases, you are actually able to hit the sweet spot. For example, F# is a native language with native speed on the CLI, and it is very good at writing compilers. So, writing the F# compiler in F# gives you #1 (writing in itself), #2 (writing in a native, fast language) and #3 (writing in a language that is good for writing compilers). The same applies to Scala.</p>

<p>There are some other JVMs with tracing JITs, though: <a href=""http://HotPath.GoogleCode.Com/"" rel=""nofollow"">HotPath</a> and <a href=""http://Labs.Oracle.Com/projects/maxine/"" rel=""nofollow"">Maxine</a>, for example.</p>

"<p>Quite-probably a silly question, as I don't know much about Java/Jython/JRuby/bytecode, but..</p>

<p>I stumbled across <a href=""http://github.com/devyn/unholy"" rel=""nofollow"">_why's unholy</a> again today.. It allows you to output Python bytecode from Ruby code.. Basically allowing them to produce the same bytecode..</p>

<p>Jython outputs Java bytecode, as does JRuby.. Since these both compile to the same bytecode, does this mean you could potentially use any Python library from Ruby, and Ruby libraries from Python?</p>
","2988","","<p>No, that won't work. At least not the way you think it would.</p>

<p>Interoperability between Jython and JRuby works the same way as between CPython and YARV: they both run on the same platform, so they can communicate with each other using that platform.</p>

<p>In the case of CPython and YARV, that platform is C/POSIX, so they can communicate with each other using C structs, <code>int</code>s, <code>char*</code>s and C function calls. In the case of Jython and JRuby, that platform is the JVM, so they can communicate with each other using JVM objects, JVM classes, JVM interfaces, JVM types and JVM methods.</p>

<p>In both cases, those platform primitives look <em>nothing</em> like Python or Ruby objects.</p>

<p>To JRuby, Jython is just yet another Java program. To Jython, JRuby is just another Java program.</p>

<p>For example: in Ruby, you can add, remove and redefine methods dynamically at any moment. On the JVM, the smallest unit of code that can be dynamically added and removed is a class. So, a Ruby method is actually not represented as a Java method. It is represented as a Java <em>class</em>. And logically, a Ruby object with a couple of methods is represented as a Java object with no methods, just a <code>Dictionary&lt;String, RubyMethod&gt;</code> field. IOW: it's totally unusable from Java, and, since from JRuby's point of view Jython is just Java, it's also unusable from Jython.</p>

<p>Now, there <em>are</em> ways to make this a little bit better. You could use actual Java types to communicate between the two&nbsp;&ndash; both implementations have great interoperability with Java. So, instead of passing a Ruby hash to Python or a Python dictionary to Ruby, you would use a Java <code>Map</code> from both Ruby and Python. But note that this requires that <em>both</em> your Ruby and Python code are specifically written to work on the JVM. IOW: you cannot just use any Python or Ruby library you find on the web, which is what you are asking about.</p>

<p>Another possibility is the one mentioned by @duncan in his answer: embed Jython or JRuby as a scripting engine into your Ruby or Python application. But again, this doesn't really answer your question about using arbitrary Python libraries from Ruby or vice versa.</p>

<p>So, what is the problem here?</p>

<p>The problem is that in order for the two runtimes to communicate, they need to speak the same ""language"". And in this particular case, the only language that the two runtimes have in common, is Java, or rather a severely crippled subset of Java.</p>

<p>So, we need to find a common language. One way to define such a language would be for both runtimes to understand each other's Meta-Object Protocol (MOP).</p>

<p>A MOP is basically an object model for the language's object model. Um, that's confusing because we use the word ""object model"" to mean two different things. Let me rephrase that:</p>

<p>A MOP is basically a domain model for the language's object system. Just like a domain model for a banking system contains objects that represent real-world customers, accounts, balances, ledgers and so on, and methods that represent real-world actions like money transfers, withdrawals and so on, a MOP contains objects that represent language classes, methods, variables, objects and methods that represent language actions like looking up a variable, calling a method, inheriting from a class, constructing an instance of a class.</p>

<p>Normally, every runtime keeps its MOP private, and every runtime has its own MOP.</p>

<p>If JRuby and Jython exposed their MOPs to each other and understood each other's MOPs (or, even better yet: they exposed their MOPs to the JVM and both used <em>the same</em> MOP), then you could pass one of those crazy JRuby method bags to Jython, and it would know how to find the methods that belong to that object and how to call them, because it can just ask JRuby's MOP how to do it.</p>

<p>There is actually a project to create just such a MOP for the JVM: the <a href=""http://DynaLang.SourceForge.Net/"">dynalang MOP</a> is a project for a shared, standardized MOP for dynamic languages running on the JVM. It was created by Attila Szegedi, the maintainer of the Mozilla Rhino ECMAScript engine. At the moment, none of the big language implementations uses it, but there is collaboration going on between at least Rhino, JRuby, Jython and Groovy to make sure that dynalang is generic enough that it can support all of the different language's object models.</p>

<p>If you want a sneak peek at what a world with such a shared MOP would look like, you can take a look at Microsoft's Dynamic Language Runtime (DLR). The DLR contains just such a MOP and all runtimes which support the DLR (which, in addition to the usual suspects such as <a href=""http://IronRuby.Net/"">IronRuby</a>, <a href=""http://IronPython.Net/"">IronPython</a>, <a href=""http://IronJS.Com/"">IronJS</a> and <a href=""http://IronScheme.CodePlex.Com/"">IronScheme</a> now also includes C# 4 and Visual Basic.NET 10) can almost seamlessly interoperate with each other.</p>

<p>Another similar platform is the <a href=""http://ParrotCode.Org/"">Parrot Virtual Machine</a>, which was specifically designed to allow multiple dynamic languages to interoperate on the same runtime platform. There are implementations of Python (<a href=""http://Pynie.GoogleCode.Com/"">Pynie</a>) and Ruby (<a href=""https://GitHub.Com/Cardinal/"">Cardinal</a>) available, but especially Cardinal is still very far from being even a remotely complete Ruby implementation.</p>

"<p>I'm searching for a definitive document on Ruby syntax. I know about the definitive documents for the core API and standard library, but what about the syntax itself? For instance, such a document should cover: reserved words, string literals syntax, naming rules for variables/classes/modules, all the conditional statements and their permutations, and so forth.</p>

<p>I know there are many books and tutorials, yes, but every one of them is essentially a tutorial, each one having a range of different depth and focus. They will all, by necessity of brevity and narrative flow, omit certain details of the language that the author deems insignificant.</p>

<p>For instance, did you know that you can use a case statement without an initial case value, and it will then execute the first true when clause? Any given Ruby book or tutorial may or may not cover that particular lesser-known functionality of the case syntax. It's not discussed in the section in ""Programming Ruby"" about case statements. But that is just one small example.</p>

<p>So far the best documentation I've found is the rubyspec project, which appears to be an attempt to write a complete test suite for the language. That's not bad, but it's a bit hard to use from a practical standpoint as a developer working on my own projects.</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://Ruby-Std.NetLab.Jp/"">ISO Draft Specification</a> contains a 39 page appendix with a summary of the grammar. Note, however, that ISO Ruby is a minimal subset of the intersection of Ruby 1.8 and 1.9. IOW: it doesn't describe anything that is only in 1.8 or only in 1.9 (so, the syntax additions in 1.9 like stabby proc and symbol hashes aren't described), nor does it describe <em>everything</em> in that intersection. ISO Ruby is a bit like ISO HTML in that regard.</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://RubySpec.Org/"">RubySpec</a> project contains executable specifications for the Ruby language. It doesn't contain an explicit specification of the grammar, though. The only specification of the grammar is <em>implicit</em> in the examples themselves. Also, because RubySpec is an example-based spec, it can only show you specific examples of valid Ruby code, but it cannot tell you <em>all</em> possible valid Ruby programs like a grammar spec could. And, because RubySpec is itself executable Ruby code, it can only show you valid examples, not invalid ones.</p>

<p>The last thing that could be considered definitive is the book <a href=""http://OReilly.Com/catalog/9780596516178/""><em>The Ruby Programming Language</em></a> by David Flanagan and Yukihiro ""matz"" Matsumoto.</p>

"<p>I've never been able to figure this out.  If your language doesn't type-check, what benefits do interfaces provide you?</p>

<p>And, in fact, it doesn't even check them at runtime, it checks them at <em>load time</em>, which happens <em>before</em> runtime. And isn't ""type checking doesn't happen at runtime but before that"" pretty much the very definition of static type checking?</p>

  <p>What exactly is Arel in Rails 3.0?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's an object model for an algebra of relational query operators.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I understand that it is a replacement for ActiveRecord</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, it isn't. It's a replacement for hand-crafting SQL queries in strings. It is a common query layer that <em>underlies</em> ActiveRecord, but it can also be used as an underpinning for DataMapper, for example.</p>

<p>If it is a replacement for anything, it's a replacement for Ambition. Or, you can think of it as a Ruby version of the LINQ standard query operators or Python's SQLAlchemy. (In fact, the author explicitly cites both LINQ and SQLAlchemy as inspirations.)</p>

<p>Or, you can see it as a replacement for <code>named_scope</code>s. In fact, ARel is pretty much the realization of the idea that ""every query is a <code>named_scope</code>"". And, whaddayaknow: both were written by the same guy.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>and that it uses objects instead of queries.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, it uses objects <em>as</em> queries.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>why is this better?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ruby is an object-oriented language, not a string-oriented language. For that reason <em>alone</em>, it makes sense to represent queries as objects instead of strings. Building a proper object model for queries instead of using strings for everything gives you pretty much the same benefits that building a proper object model for an accounting system instead of using strings for everything gives you.</p>

<p>Another big advantage is that ARel implements an actual <em>algebra</em> of query operators. In other words, ARel knows about the mathematical rules for constructing and composing queries. If you concatenate two strings, each of which contains a valid SQL query, the result is probably not going to be a valid SQL query. Or, even worse, it <em>is</em> a valid SQL query, but one that doesn't make sense, or that does something totally different from what you think it does. This can <em>never</em> happen with ARel. (This is what the article I link to below means with ""closed under composition"".)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>will objects/queries be ""easier"" to create?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. For example, as I mentioned above, it is much easier to construct more complex queries from simpler parts.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>will it lead to more efficient SQL queries?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. The fact that ARel has a proper object model for the queries means that it can perform optimizations on those queries long before it ever generates an actual SQL query.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>will it be compatible with all major DBs? - I assume it will.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. In fact, I always talked about SQL above, but actually a relational query algebra can generate queries for pretty much everything. Again, see LINQ or Ambition as examples: both can query SQL, LDAP, ActiveResource, CouchDB, Amazon, Google, &hellip; all with the same syntax.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best discussion as to what ARel is and why Nick Kallen wrote is the aptly named article <a href=""http://MagicScalingSprinkles.WordPress.Com/2010/01/28/why-i-wrote-arel/""><em>Why Arel?</em> by Nick Kallen</a> himself.

If there is enough interest in the project, then one of the people who forked the repository will emerge as the new community leader.

"<p>Where can I find an explanation and implementation of the diff algorithm?</p>

<p>First of all I have to recognize that I'm not sure if this is the correct name of the algorithm. For example, how does Stack Overflow mark the differences between two edits of the same question?</p>

<p>PS: I know the C and PHP programming languages.</p>
","2988","","<p>There is really no such thing as ""the diff algorithm"". There are many different diff algorithms, and in fact the particular diff algorithms used are in some cases considered a business advantage of the particular diff tool.</p>

<p>In general, many diff algorithms are based on the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem.</p>

<p>The original Unix <code>diff</code> program from the 1970s was written by Doug McIllroy and uses what is known as the Hunt-McIllroy algorithm. Almost 40 years later, extensions and derivatives of that algorithm are still very common.</p>

<p>A couple of years ago, Bram Cohen (creator of the most successful filesharing program and the least successful version control system) created the <a href=""http://BramCohen.LiveJournal.Com/73318.html"">Patience Diff algorithm</a> that is designed to give more human-readable results than LCS. It was originally implemented in the Bazaar VCS and also added to Git as an option.</p>

<p>However, unless you are interested in research on diff algorithms, your best bet would probably be to just use some existing diff library like <a href=""http://XMailServer.Org/xdiff.html"">Davide Libenzi's LibXDiff</a>, which is for example what Git uses. I wouldn't be too surprised if there was already a PHP extension wrapping it. An nice alternative is <a href=""http://Google-Diff-Match-Patch.GoogleCode.Com/"">Google's Diff-Match-Patch library</a>, which is used in Bespin or WhiteRoom, for example and which is available for many languages. It uses the Meyers Diff Algorithm plus some pre- and post-processing for additional speedups.</p>

<p>A completely different approach, if you are more interested in merging than diffing, is called Operational Transformations. The idea of OT is that instead of figuring out the differences between two documents, you try to ""reverse engineer"" the <em>operations</em> that led to those differences. This allows for much better merging, because you can then ""replay"" those operations. These are most useful for real-time collaborative editors such as EtherPad, Google Wave or SubEthaEdit.</p>

<p><code>const</code> was also a part of ECMAScript 4.</p>

<p>ECMAScript 4 was never released and never will be, and ECMAScript Harmony will only be released in a couple of years. Therefore, you cannot reliably use it.</p>

"<p>I'm kind of new to Ruby and some of the closure logic has me a confused. Consider this code:</p>

for i in (1..5)
  array &lt;&lt; lambda {i}
end
array.map{|f| f.call} # =&gt; [5, 5, 5, 5, 5]
</code></pre>

<p>This makes sense to me because i is bound outside the loop, so the same variable is captured by each trip through the loop. It also makes sense to me that using an each block can fix this:</p>

<pre><code>array = []
(1..5).each{|i|  array &lt;&lt; lambda {i}}
array.map{|f| f.call} # =&gt; [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
</code></pre>

<p>...because i is now being declared separately for each time through. But now I get lost: why can't I also fix it by introducing an intermediate variable?</p>

<pre><code>array = []
for i in 1..5
  j = i
  array &lt;&lt; lambda {j}
end
array.map{|f| f.call} # =&gt; [5, 5, 5, 5, 5]
</code></pre>

<p>Because j is new each time through the loop, I'd think a different variable would be captured on each pass. For example, this is definitely how C# works, and how -- I think-- Lisp behaves with a let. But in Ruby not so much. What's really happening?</p>

<p>Edit: See comments in the answers; the problem seems to be that j is still in scope outside the loop. How does scope in loops really work?</p>

<p>Edit: I guess I still don't understand; if loops don't create new scopes, why this:</p>

<pre><code>for i in 1..5
  puts j if i &gt; 1 #undefined local variable or method `j' for main:Object (NameError)
  j = i
end

","2988","","<p>Okay, this is getting ridiculous. Every time I try to answer a question about how <code>for</code> loops work in Ruby, I get it wrong.</p>

<p>The reason for this is, of course, that I don't use <code>for</code> loops in Ruby, neither does anybody else, so it really doesn't matter to me :-)</p>

<p>Anyway, to settle the matter once and for all, I went straight to <a href=""http://Ruby-Std.NetLab.Jp/"" rel=""nofollow"">the ultimate source</a>, the December 1, 2009 preliminary Draft of the IPA Ruby Language Specification (destined to become the ISO Ruby Language Specification):</p>

<blockquote>
  <h1>§11.4.1.2.3 The <code>for</code> expression</h1>
  
  <h2>Syntax</h2>
  
  <ul>
  <li><em>for-expression</em> <strong>&rarr;</strong> <kbd>for</kbd> <em>for-variable</em> <kbd>in</kbd> <em>expression</em>  <em>do-clause</em> <kbd>end</kbd></li>
  <li><em>for-variable</em> <strong>&rarr;</strong> <em>left-hand-side</em> <strong>|</strong> <em>multiple-left-hand-side</em></li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>The <em>expression</em> of a <em>for-expression</em> shall not be a <em>jump-expression</em>.</p>
  
  <h2>Semantics</h2>
  
  <p>A <em>for-expression</em> is evaluated as follows:</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>Evaluate the <em>expression</em>. Let <code>O</code> be the resulting value.</li>
  <li><p>Let <code>E</code> be the <em>primary-method-invocation</em> of the form <em>primary-expression</em> <strong>[no line-terminator here]</strong><kbd>.each do |</kbd> <em>block-formal-argument-list</em> <kbd>|</kbd> <em>block-body</em> <kbd>end</kbd>, where the value of the <em>primary-expression</em> is <code>O</code>,the <em>block-formal-argument-list</em> is the <em>for-variable</em>, the <em>block-body</em> is the <em>compound-statement</em> of the <em>do-clause</em>.</p>
  
  <p>Evaluate <code>E</code>, but skip Step c of §11.2.2.</p></li>
  <li><p>The value of the <em>for-expression</em> is the resulting value of the invocation.</p></li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay, so basically this means that</p>

<pre><code>for for_variable in expression
  do_clause
end
</code></pre>

<p>gets translated to</p>

<pre><code>O = expression
O.each do |for_variable|
  do_clause
end
</code></pre>

<p>Or, in your case:</p>

<pre><code>for i in 1..5
  puts j if i &gt; 1 #undefined local variable or method `j' (NameError)
  j = i
end
</code></pre>

<p>gets translated to</p>

<pre><code>(1..5).each do |i|
  puts j if i &gt; 1 #no excpetion here, works just fine ??!!??
  j = i
end
</code></pre>

<p>Aha! But we forgot something! There's this ominous ""skip Step c of §11.2.2."" thing! So, what does it say?</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Push an empty set of local variable bindings onto ⟦local-variable-bindings⟧.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that Step b</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Set the execution context to <code>E</code><sub><code>b</code></sub>.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>is <em>not</em> skipped.</p>

<p>So, as far as I can see, a <code>for</code> loop gets its own execution context, which starts out as a copy of the current execution context, but it <em>does not</em> get its own set of local variable bindings. IOW: it gets its own dynamic execution context, but not its own lexical scope.</p>

<p>I must admit, I'm still not sure I fully understand it, but it doesn't get any more precise than this.</p>

"<p>I found that a lot of Java programs in Windows use .bat batch file as program launcher. It looks weird if compared with other programs which use .exe executable file.</p>

<p>Why can't those Java programs use .exe file? Is that a limitation of Java program?</p>

"<p>I'm trying to create a Messages object that inherits Array. The messages will gather a group of Message objects. I'm trying to create an xml output with ROXML that looks like this:</p>

  xml_accessor :code
  xml_accessor :body

messages = Messages.new
messages.add message

puts messages.to_xml

<p>This outputs:</p>

<pre><code>1

<p>Thanks for any help.</p>
","2988","","<p>I don't think what you want is possible. You are somehow trying to get access to the internal state of the <code>Array</code> class, which is not only impossible because on most implementations those internals are hidden away in the C/C++/Java/.NET/Objective-C/ABAP runtime but also quite simply a bad idea and bad object-oriented design.</p>

<p>The thing is, <code>Messages</code> is really not an <code>Array</code>, therefore it shouldn't inherit from <code>Array</code>. Tell me: are you really 100% sure that your <code>Messages</code> class is able to faithfully fulfill the contracts of <em>all</em> 81 methods on <code>Array</code>? And what do <code>assoc</code>, <code>rassoc</code>, <code>rindex</code> and <code>transpose</code> even <em>mean</em>, when applied to <code>Messages</code>?</p>

<p>You'd be much better off using delegation instead of inheritance here. This gives you a nice named entity that you can pass to <code>xml_accessor</code>:</p>

<pre><code>require 'forwardable'
require 'roxml'

class Messages
  extend Forwardable
  include ROXML

  class &lt;&lt; self; alias_method :[], :new end

  xml_reader :messages, :as =&gt; [Message]

  def initialize(*messages) @messages = messages end

  def_delegators :messages, :length, :&lt;&lt;
end
</code></pre>

<p>Note: I also changed a couple of other things here. For example, I personally believe that an object should be valid and usable after it is constructed. In your version of the code, a <code>Message</code> is basically invalid after it is constructed and only becomes valid after you call the <code>type=</code>, <code>code=</code> and <code>body=</code> setters:</p>

<pre><code>class Message
  include ROXML

  class &lt;&lt; self; alias_method :[], :new end

  xml_reader :type, :body
  xml_reader :code, :as =&gt; Integer

  def initialize(type=nil, code=nil, body=nil)
    @type, @code, @body = case opts = type
    when Hash
      opts[:type], opts[:code], opts[:body]
    else
      type, code, body
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Here's a slightly expanded usage example:</p>

<pre><code>msgs = Messages[Message['error', 1234, 'This is a test message.'], Message[]]

msgs &lt;&lt; Message[
  type: 'warning', 
  code: 4815162342, 
  body: 'This is another test message.'
]

puts msgs.to_xml
# =&gt; &lt;messages&gt;
# =&gt;   &lt;message&gt;
# =&gt;     &lt;type&gt;error&lt;/type&gt;
# =&gt;     &lt;body&gt;This is a test message.&lt;/body&gt;
# =&gt;     &lt;code&gt;1234&lt;/code&gt;
# =&gt;   &lt;/message&gt;
# =&gt;   &lt;message/&gt;
# =&gt;   &lt;message&gt;
# =&gt;     &lt;type&gt;warning&lt;/type&gt;
# =&gt;     &lt;body&gt;This is another test message.&lt;/body&gt;
# =&gt;     &lt;code&gt;4815162342&lt;/code&gt;

"<p>Well, first I should probably ask if this is browser dependent.</p>

<p>I've read that if an invalid token is found, but the section of code is valid until that invalid token, a semicolon is inserted before the token if it is preceded by a line break.<br>
However, the common example cited for bugs caused by semicolon insertion is:</p>

<pre><code>return
  _a+b;
</code></pre>

<p>which doesn't seem to follow this rule, since _a would be a valid token. On the other hand, breaking up call chains works as expected:</p>

<pre><code>$('#myButton')
  .click(function(){alert(""Hello!"")});
</code></pre>

<p>Does anyone have a more in-depth description of the rules?</p>
","2988","","<p>Straight from the <a href=""http://WWW.ECMA-International.Org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">ECMA-262, Fifth Edition ECMAScript Specification</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h1>7.9.1 Rules of Automatic Semicolon Insertion</h1>
  
  <p>There are three basic rules of semicolon insertion:</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>When, as the program is parsed from left to right, a token (called the <em>offending token</em>) is encountered that is not allowed by any production of the grammar,  then a semicolon is automatically inserted before the offending token if one or more of the following conditions is true:
  <ul>
  <li>The offending token is separated from the previous token by at least one <code>LineTerminator</code>.</li>
  <li>The offending token is <kbd>}</kbd>.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>When, as the program is parsed from left to right,  the end of the input stream of tokens is encountered and the parser is unable to parse the input token stream as a single complete ECMAScript <code>Program</code>, then a semicolon is automatically inserted at the end of the input stream.</li>
  <li>When, as the program is parsed from left to right, a token is encountered that is allowed by some production of the grammar, but the production is a <em>restricted production</em> and the token would be the first token for a terminal or nonterminal immediately following the annotation ""<sub>[no <code>LineTerminator</code> here]</sub>"" within the restricted production (and therefore such a token is called a restricted token), and the restricted token is separated from the previous token by at least one <strong>LineTerminator</strong>, then a semicolon is automatically inserted before the restricted token.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>However, there is an additional overriding condition on  the preceding rules: a semicolon is never inserted automatically if the semicolon would then be parsed as an empty statement or if that semicolon would become one of the two semicolons in the header of a <kbd>for</kbd> statement (see 12.6.3).</p>

"<p>I've noticed at least the following oddities around rubygems on Debian (5.0 lenny in my case):</p>

<ul>
<li>Packages go into a different installation location: /var/lib/gems vs /usr/lib/ruby/gems</li>
<li>The debian package is rubygems 1.3.6, and updating rubygems to the latest version (1.3.7) doesn't work:</li>
</ul>

<pre>
  $ sudo gem update --system
  ERROR:  While executing gem ... (RuntimeError)
    gem update --system is disabled on Debian. RubyGems can be updated using the official Debian repositories by aptitude or apt-get.
</pre>

<ul>
<li>Not all gems appear to work like they do on other systems. For instance, when installing Phusion Passenger, it did not detect the ""rack"" gem even though it was definitely installed.</li>
<li>Manually installing rubygems using the source tarball and reinstalling all my gems (to /usr/lib/ruby/gems) made my problems go away.</li>
</ul>

<p>What's the deal? Why is debian's package different?</p>
","2988","","<p>Note that what I wrote below has significantly changed recently. The Debian Ruby Team has more or less completely revamped their entire approach, including but not limited to their packaging of RubyGems. I'm not sure about Debian 6, but in the version <em>after</em> that, installing Ruby and the RubyGems package from Debian should be safe, maybe even recommended. And obviously, that is going to trickle down into Ubuntu as well.</p>

<hr>

<p>[EDIT: The following is outdated as of Debian 7 at the latest.]</p>

<p>Mixing to two different package managers is generally a <em>very bad</em> idea. The Debian-Ruby team tries their best to patch RubyGems in such a way that it becomes a slightly less bad idea.</p>

<p>Also, Debian has a set of rules that are intended to keep the system consistent. RubyGems <em>also</em> has its own set of rules. Those two sets of rules are unfortunately not compatible. So, the Debian-Ruby developers patch RubyGems to respect <em>Debian's</em> rules instead of RubyGems's. Moving gems from <code>/usr/lib/ruby</code> to <code>/var/lib</code> is one of those things.</p>

<p>Another problem is that Debian stable is, well, stable. This means that the Debian team <em>guarantees</em> that the behavior of the <em>entire</em> system, all 20000 packages, will <em>never</em> change during a release. But the RubyGems developers don't make their bugfixes available separately, the only way to get a bugfix is to upgrade to a new version, with (potentially) different behavior. Therefore, the Debian-Ruby developers cannot just take the RubyGems sources unmodified, they have to reverse engineer the bugfixes from 1.3.7 and apply them to <em>their</em> version of 1.3.6, to ensure backwards compatibility.</p>

<p>In general, you should avoid mixing package managers. Either use RubyGems for everything (in which case it is best to install RubyGems from source instead of using the Debian package) or use APT for everything, in which case you might be interested in <a href=""http://DebGem.Com/"">DebGem</a>, a service by the Phusion guys (makers of Ruby Enterprise Edition and Phusion Passenger) which provides Debian and Ubuntu packages for pretty much all Gems.</p>

"<p>Lets say I have the following array:</p>

<pre><code>my_array = [1, 5, 8, 11, -6]
</code></pre>

<p>I need to iterate over this array and add the values prior to the current value together.  An example will probably be easier to understand. I need to return an array that should look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>final_array = [1, 6, 14, 25, 19]
</code></pre>

<p>I have tried doing something like this:</p>

<pre><code>my_array.collect {|value| value + previous_values }
</code></pre>

<p>But obviously that doesn't work because I can't figure out how to get the previous values in the array.  </p>

<p>I am a programming noob so this might be easier than I am making it.  I am pretty sure I need to use either collect or inject, but I can't seem to figure out how to do this.  </p>

<p>Any help would be appreciated. </p>
","2988","","<p>My very first instinct was: ""That's obviously a scan (aka prefix-sum), so that should be easy"":</p>

<pre><code>[1, 5, 8, 11, -6].scan(:+)
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously, I've been reading way too much Haskell and Scala lately, because <em>there is no <code>Enumerable#scan</code></em> in Ruby &hellip; yet:</p>

<pre><code>module Enumerable
  def scan(initial=first, &amp;block)
    [initial].tap {|res| 
      reduce {|acc, el| 
        block.(acc, el).tap {|el|
          res &lt;&lt; el
        }
      }
    }
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>If you want <code>Enumerable#scan</code> to behave like <code>Enumerable#reduce</code>, i.e. take an optional initial argument and an optional symbol, we need to enhance our version slightly with some argument massaging code stolen from Rubinius's <code>Enumerable#reduce</code>:</p>

<pre><code>module Enumerable
  def scan(initial=nil, sym=nil, &amp;block)
    args = if initial then [initial] else [] end
    unless block_given?
      args, sym, initial = [], initial, first unless sym
      block = -&gt;(acc, el) { acc.send(sym, el) }
    end
    [initial || first].tap {|res| 
      reduce(*args) {|acc, el| 
        block.(acc, el).tap {|e|
          res &lt;&lt; e
        }
      }
    }
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>With this enhanced version, the example above now works:</p>

<pre><code>p [1, 5, 8, 11, -6].scan(:+)
# =&gt; [1, 6, 14, 25, 19]
</code></pre>

<p>If you have this kind of problem again, in another language, remember the terms <em>scan</em> and <em>prefix-sum</em>, such functions are usually pretty common. I don't quite understand why Ruby doesn't have them already.</p>

"<p>Are SAFE levels supported in JRuby? If not, is there other ways of safely running user supplied code in server?</p>
","2988","","<p>AFAIK, they aren't supported.</p>

<p>The main problem is that they are <em>very badly</em> documented, so how are the JRuby developers supposed to provide a compatible implementation if nobody knows what a compatible implementation <em>is</em>?</p>

<p>Another reason not to waste time implementing <code>$SAFE</code> levels in JRuby, is that the JVM's security mechanisms provide better protection anyway. Which is also the answer to your second question: from the point of view of the JVM, your Ruby script is just another Java program and it can be sandboxed and controlled just like any other Java program.</p>

<p>As for TFS: is there even an open specification for it? If not, then implementing another client would basically amount to massive amounts of reverse engineering.

","2988","","<p>Simple: it does it the same way <em>you</em> do, ever since first grade. Except it doesn't compute in base 10, it computes in base 4 billion (and change).</p>

<p>Think about it: with <em>our</em> number system, we can only represent numbers from <code>0</code> to <code>9</code>. So, how can we compute <code>6+7</code> without overflowing? Easy: we <em>do</em> actually overflow! We cannot represent the result of <code>6+7</code> as a number between <code>0</code> and <code>9</code>, but we <em>can</em> overflow to the next place and represent it as <em>two</em> numbers between <code>0</code> and <code>9</code>: 3&times;10<sup>0</sup> + 1&times;10<sup>1</sup>. If you want to add two numbers, you add them digit-wise from the right and overflow (""carry"") to the left. If you want to multiply two numbers, you have to multiply every digit of one number individually with the other number, then add up the intermediate results.</p>

<p>BigNum arithmetic (this is what this kind of arithmetic where the numbers are bigger than the native machine numbers is usually called) works basically the same way. Except that the base is not 10, and its not 2, either&nbsp;&ndash; it's the size of a native machine integer. So, on a 32 bit machine, it would be base 2<sup>32</sup> or 4&thinsp;294&thinsp;967&thinsp;296.</p>

<p>Specifically, in Ruby <code>Integer</code> is actually an abstract class that is never instianted. Instead, it has two subclasses, <code>Fixnum</code> and <code>Bignum</code>, and numbers automagically migrate between them, depending on their size. In MRI and YARV, Fixnum can hold a 31 or 63 bit signed integer (one bit is used for tagging) depending on the native word size of the machine. In JRuby, a Fixnum can hold a full 64 bit signed integer, even on an 32 bit machine.</p>

<p>The simplest operation is adding two numbers. And if you look at the implementation of <code>+</code> or rather <code>bigadd_core</code> in YARV's <a href=""https://GitHub.Com/Ruby/Ruby/blob/trunk/bignum.c#L1816-1848"">bignum.c</a>, it's not <em>too</em> bad to follow. I can't read C either, but you can cleary see how it loops over the individual digits.</p>

"<p>I was looking at the <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/interact/scripts.html"">W3C specs for the script tag</a>, and I noticed you can specify VBScript and TCL as a language type. This is extremely new to me; I've only ever seen Javascript used with the script tag.</p>

<p>Why aren't other languages more commonly used, and is there a complete list of languages you can use within this tag?</p>
","2988","","<p>You can put anything you want in there. That's the <em>whole point</em> of MIME types.</p>

<p>The question is of course whether or not your user's browser can actually interpret it. But that's not really specific to the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> element. My browser, for example, only understands CSS for stylesheets, others also understand XSLT. My browser only understands HTML, XHTML, HTML5, MathML and SVG for documents, others also understand PDF or don't understand MathML. My browser understands alpha-transparent PNGs, others don't. Before the GIF patent ran out, there were some browsers that didn't understand GIFs, while others paid the licensing fees (or used the patent illegally or were developed in jurisdictions where software patents are illegal) and did understand GIFs. Some browsers understand H.264 videos, others Theora.</p>

<p>In general, the only language that is guaranteed to be understood by all browsers, is ECMAScript 3rd Edition. Most browsers also understand some subset of JavaScript.</p>

<p>Many versions of Internet Explorer understand VBScript.</p>

<p>The CoffeeScript compiler can be compiled to ECMAScript and embedded into a website, so that you can use CoffeeScript in your page via the <code>text/coffeescript</code> MIME type.</p>

<p>There's a project called HotRuby, which is a YARV bytecode interpreter written in ECMAScript. It allows you to use <code>text/ruby</code>.</p>

<p>Microsoft has a project called Gestalt, which uses IronRuby and IronPython running on top of the DLR inside Silverlight to provide support for <code>text/python</code> and <code>text/ruby</code> (and presumably <em>any</em> language that can run on top of the DLR, e.g. Scheme, Smalltalk, PHP, Tcl.)</p>

<p>Mozilla had a project a while back called IronMonkey, I believe, which embedded multiple popular execution engines, such as MRI Ruby, CPython, Perl and others into Firefox, allowing the use of all those languages for browser scripting.</p>

<p>I remember reading somewhere that someone built a plugin for tcc (tiny C compiler) support, which would allow you to use <code>text/c</code>.</p>

<p>Just a couple of days ago, Miguel de Icaza (the creater of Mono) suggested that the ISO CLI should be added to the browser as a scripting platform, allowing you to use CIL bytecode for scripting via an <code>application/cil</code> MIME type.</p>

"<p>I am preparing for my interview tomorrow -- I need the answer to this question:</p>

<p>How can you print 1 to 10 &amp; 10 to 1 by using recursion with single variable</p>
","2988","","<p>Here's one in Ruby:</p>

<pre><code>puts (r = -&gt;n=1 { if n&lt;=10 then [n] + r.(n+1) + [n] else [] end }).()
</code></pre>

<p>Note: before you conclude that Ruby is an unreadable mess even worse than Perl, let me assure you: this is <em>not</em> idiomatic Ruby. Idiomatic Ruby would be more like</p>

<pre><code>def recursive_count_up_and_down(n=1)
  return [] unless n&lt;=10
  [n] +
  recursive_count_up_and_down(n + 1) +
  [n]
end

puts recursive_count_up_and_down
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, Ruby is an imperative language, so doing it <em>really</em> idiomatically would not use recursion:</p>

<pre><code>1.upto(10) do |i| puts i end
10.downto(1) do |i| puts i end
</code></pre>

<p>Here's another neat one that unfortunately doesn't use recursion, either:</p>

<pre><code>puts Array.new(20) {|i| if i &lt; 10 then i+1 else 20-i end }
</code></pre>

<p>BTW: all the solutions so far, including mine, are actually cheating, because technically they use <em>two</em> variables, because</p>

<pre><code>function foo {}
</code></pre>

<p>is equivalent to</p>

<pre><code>var foo = λ{}
</code></pre>

<p>So, in my example above, there are <em>two</em> variables: <code>recursive_count_up_and_down</code> and <code>n</code>. We could eliminate both of those by writing in a tacit point-free style (for example in the SK-calculus), but I'll leave that as an exercise to the reader. (Meaning I can't figure it out :-) )</p>

"<p>first time at stack overflow.</p>

<p>I'm looking into using some of the metaprogramming features provided by Ruby or Python, but first I need to know the extent to which they will allow me to extend the language.  The main thing I need to be able to do is to rewrite the concept of <em>Class</em>.  This doesn't mean that I want to rewrite a <em>specific</em> class during run time, but rather I want to make my own conceptualization of what a <em>Class</em> is.  To be a smidge more specific here, I want to make something that is <em>like</em> what people normally call a Class, but I want to follow an ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_world_assumption"" rel=""nofollow"">open world</a>"" assumption.  In the ""closed world"" of normal Classes, if I declare Poodle to be a subclass of Dog to be a subclass of Animal, then I know that Poodle is not going to also be a type of FurCoat.  However, in an open world Class, then the Poodle object I've defined may or may not be and object of type FurCoat and we won't know for sure until I explain that I can wear the poodle.  (Poor poodle.)  This all has to do with a study I'm doing concerning OWL ontologies.</p>

<p>Just so you know, I've tried to find information online, but due to the overloading of terms here I haven't found anything helpful.</p>

<p>Super thanks,
John</p>

<p>UPDATE: I just thought of a good use case for my open-world concept of Class. Perhaps this will provide a better understanding of what I really wish to do.  I want to be able to ""describe"" a Class rather than define it.  For instance, I want to be able to say that a Dog is anything that a) has four legs b) barks. Then I want to be able to create an object of unspecified Class, and describe that this object has four legs.  At this point the object is still of unspecified type.  Then I want to say that the object barks.  At this point, the object will be known to be (possibly among other things) a Dog.</p>
","2988","","<p>No, you cannot do that in <a href=""http://Ruby-Lang.Org/"" rel=""nofollow"">Ruby</a>. In Ruby, the object model is baked into the <a href=""http://Ruby-Std.NetLab.Jp/"" rel=""nofollow"">language specification</a> and is not accessible (and certainly not <em>modifiable</em>) from within the program. Even in <a href=""http://Rubini.us/"" rel=""nofollow"">Rubinius</a>, which is a Ruby implementation written mostly in Ruby, and with amazing metaprogramming capabilities that extend far beyond what the Ruby specification offers, some of <a href=""https://GitHub.Com/EvanPhx/Rubinius/blob/master/vm/dispatch.cpp"" rel=""nofollow"">the fundamental primitives are hardwired in C++</a>.</p>

<p>I am not that intimately familiar with <a href=""http://Python.Org/"" rel=""nofollow"">Python</a>, but I'm pretty sure it's the same way, even in <a href=""http://PyPy.Org/"" rel=""nofollow"">PyPy</a>.</p>

<p>You <em>might</em> be able to do that in <a href=""http://Smalltalk.Org/"" rel=""nofollow"">Smalltalk</a>, by modifying (or subclassing) <a href=""http://Magaloma.SeasideHosting.ST/Kernel#Behavior"" rel=""nofollow"">the <code>Behavior</code> class</a>, which is the superclass of <code>Class</code> and defines the behavior of both classes and metaclasses.</p>

<p>You can <em>certainly</em> do that in <a href=""http://Wikipedia.Org/wiki/Common_Lisp_Object_System"" rel=""nofollow"">CLOS</a>, or more precisely using <a href=""http://Wikipedia.Org/wiki/The_Art_of_the_Metaobject_Protocol"" rel=""nofollow"">CLOS's MOP</a> (<a href=""http://Wikipedia.Org/wiki/Metaobject_protocol"" rel=""nofollow"">Meta-Object Protocol</a>). After all, that's what a MOP is for: defining the object model.</p>

<p>The closest OO concept to what you are describing seems to be that of <a href=""https://C2.Com/cgi/wiki?PredicateClasses"" rel=""nofollow"">Predicate Classes</a>. A predicate class is a class whose instances are not defined statically, but by a set of predicates: all objects that satisfy the set of predicates are instances of the class, as soon as and for as long as the predicate holds. In a language with mutable state, this obviously means that objects can ""move"" in and out of predicate classes as their state changes. It also means that at any given time an object can be an instance of many or no predicate classes.</p>

<p>The only mainstream language (for a rather broad definition of ""mainstream"") I know of that has predicate classes is <a href=""http://FactorCode.Org/"" rel=""nofollow"">Factor</a>.</p>

<p>However, please note that even here, the predicates are defined and an object either fulfils them or it doesn't. There is no concept of discovering whether or not an object fulfils a predicate at runtime.</p>

","2988","","<p>One instance where I remember needing it, was in an Apache configuration. In Apache, there is a way to redirect to a different URI if the current request matches some PCRE regexp, but there is (or at least was, back when I needed it) no way to redirect if the current request <em>does not</em> match a regexp.</p>

<p>Thankfully, I was able to Google (actually, I'm not sure that Google existed already &hellip;) for a regexp-negation regexp. But it sure took me some time, and if StackOverflow had existed back then, it would have been <em>much</em> easier.</p>

"<p>This is a reopened question.</p>

<p>I look for a language and supporting platform for it, where the language could have pass-by-reference or pass-by-name semantics by default. I know the history a little, that there were Algol, Fortran and there still is C++ which could make it possible; but, basically, what I look for is something more modern and where the mentioned value pass methodology is <em>preferred</em> and <em>by default</em> (implicitly assumed).</p>

<p>I ask this question, because, to my mind, some of the advantages of pass-by-ref/name seem kind of obvious. For example when it is used in a standalone agent, where copyiong of values is not necessary (to some extent) and performance wouldn't be downgraded much in that case. So, I could employ it in e.g. rich client app or some game-style or standalone service-kind application.</p>

<p>The main advantage to me is the clear separation between identity of a symbol, and its current value. I mean when there is no reduntant copying, you know that you're working with the exact symbol/path you have queried/received. And intristing boxing of values will not interfere with the actual logic of program.</p>

<p>I know that there is C# <code>ref</code> keyword, but it's something not so intristic, though acceptable. Equally, I realize that pass-by-reference semantics could be simulated in virtually any language (Java as an instant example) and so on.. not sure about pass by name :)</p>

<p>What would you recommend - create a something like DSL for such needs wherever it be appropriate; or use some languages that I already know? Maybe, there is something that I'm missing?</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Currently, I think that Haskell would be appropriate. But I didn't investigate much, so I think I'll update this text later.</p>
","2988","","<p>Haskell has call-by-need as its default (and indeed only) evaluation strategy.</p>

<p>Now, you asked for two things: call-by-name and modern. Well, Haskell is a pure language and in a pure language call-by-name and call-by-need are semantically the same thing, or more precisely they always have the same result, the only difference being that call-by-need is usually faster and at worst only a constant factor slower than call-by-name. And Haskell surely is a modern language: it is merely 23 years old and in many of its features it is actually 10 years ahead of many languages that were created just recently.</p>

<p>The other thing you asked about is call-by-reference. Again, in a pure language, call-by-value and call-by-reference are the same thing, except that the latter is faster. (Which is why, even though most functional languages are usually described as being call-by-value, they actually implement call-by-reference.)</p>

<p>Now, call-by-name (and by extension call-by-need) are <em>not</em> the same thing as call-by-value (and by extension call-by-reference), because call-by-name may return a result in cases where call-by-value doesn't terminate.</p>

<p>However, in all cases where call-by-value or call-by-reference terminates, in a pure language, call-by-value, call-by-reference, call-by-name and call-by-need are the same thing. And in cases where they are <em>not</em> the same thing, call-by-name and call-by-need are in some sense ""better"", because they give you an answer in cases where call-by-value and call-by-reference would basically have run into an infinite loop.</p>

"<p>I am looking for a way to convert a base-10 number into a base-N number where N can be large. Specifically i am looking at converting to base-85 and back again. Does anyone know a simple algorithm to perform the conversion? Ideally it would provide something like:</p>

<pre><code>to_radix(83992, 85) -&gt; [11, 53, 12]
</code></pre>

<p>Any ideas are appreciated!</p>

<p>Roja</p>
","2988","","<p>That was kind of an interesting question, so I went a little overboard:</p>

<pre><code>class Integer
  def to_base(base=10)
    return [0] if zero?
    raise ArgumentError, 'base must be greater than zero' unless base &gt; 0
    num = abs
    return [1] * num if base == 1
    [].tap do |digits|
      while num &gt; 0
        digits.unshift num % base
        num /= base
      end
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>This works for arbitrary bases. It only works for integers, although there is no reason why it couldn't be extended to work with any arbitrary number. Also, it ignores the sign of the number. Again, there is no reason why it <em>must</em> do that, but mainly I didn't want to have to come up with a convention for returning the sign in the return value.</p>

<pre><code>class Integer
  old_to_s = instance_method(:to_s)
  define_method :to_s do |base=10, mapping=nil, sep=''|
    return old_to_s.bind(self).(base) unless mapping || base &gt; 36
    mapping ||= '0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    return to_base(base).map {|digit| mapping[digit].to_s }.join(sep)
  end
end

[Fixnum, Bignum].each do |klass|
  old_to_s = klass.instance_method(:to_s)
  klass.send :define_method, :to_s do |base=10, mapping=nil, sep=''|
    return old_to_s.bind(self).(base) unless mapping || base &gt; 36
    return super(base, mapping, sep) if mapping
    return super(base)
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>I also extended the <code>to_s</code> method so that it works with bases greater than 36. If you want to use a base greater than 36, you have to pass in a mapping object which maps the ""digits"" to strings. (Well, actually, all that is required is that you provide an object that responds to <code>[]</code> and returns something which responds to <code>to_s</code>. So, a string is perfect, but e.g. an array of integers also works.)</p>

<p>It also accepts an optional separator, which is used to separate the digits.</p>

<p>For example, this allows you to format an IPv4 address by treating it as a base-256 number and using the identity for the mapping and <code>'.'</code> as the separator:</p>

<pre><code>2_078_934_278.to_s(256, Array.new(256) {|i| i }, '.') # =&gt; '123.234.5.6'

<p>As I'm used to using PHP and just doing <code>$array['myownassoc'] += bignumber;</code>
But I guess this isn't the right approach when using Ruby?</p>

<p>So any help in how I need to go would be nice.</p>
","2988","","<p>The problem is this:</p>

<pre><code>summa[face.material.display_name] += face.area
</code></pre>

<p>This is (roughly) equivalent to</p>

<pre><code>summa[face.material.display_name] = summa[face.material.display_name] + face.area
</code></pre>

<p>However, you start out with <code>summa</code> as an empty hash:</p>

<pre><code>summa = Hash.new
</code></pre>

<p>Which means that whenever you encounter a specific material for the first time (and obviously, this is going to be already the case in the very first iteration of the loop), <code>summa[face.material.display_name]</code> simply doesn't exist. So, you are trying to add a number to something that doesn't exist, which obviously cannot work.</p>

<p>The quick fix would be to just initialize the hash with a default value, so that it returns something useful instead of <code>nil</code> for a non-existing key:</p>

<pre><code>summa = Hash.new(0)
</code></pre>

<p>There are, however, a lot of other improvements that could be made to the code. Here's how I would do it:</p>

<pre><code>require 'sketchup'

Sketchup.active_model.entities.grep(Sketchup::Face).select(&amp;:material).
reduce(Hash.new(0)) {|h, face|
  h.tap {|h| h[face.material.display_name] += face.area }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I find that <em>much</em> easier to read, instead of ""loop over this, but skip one iteration if that thing happens, and also don't do this if that happens"".</p>

<p>This is actually a common pattern, that pretty much every Rubyist has already written a dozen times, so I actually had a code snippet lying around that I only needed to slightly adapt. However, I am going to show you how I <em>could</em> have refactored your original code step-by-step if I hadn't already had the solution.</p>

<p>First, let's start with coding style. I know it's boring, but it <em>is</em> important. <em>What</em> the actual coding style is, is not important, the important thing is that the code is <em>consistent</em>, which means that one piece of code should look the same as any other piece of code. In this particular instance, you are asking the Ruby community to provide you with unpaid support, so it is polite to at least format the code in a style that members of that community are used to. This means standard Ruby coding style: 2 spaces for indentation, snake_case for method and variable names, CamelCase for constants which refer to modules or classes, ALL_CAPS for constants, and so on. Don't use parentheses unless they clear up the precedence.</p>

<p>In your code, for example, you use sometimes 3 spaces, sometimes 4 spaces, sometimes 5 spaces and sometimes 6 spaces for indentation, and all of that in just 9 non-empty lines of code! Your coding style is not only inconsistent with the rest of the community, it isn't even consistent with its own next line!</p>

<p>Let's fix that first:</p>

<pre><code>require 'sketchup'
entities = Sketchup.active_model.entities
summa = {}

for face in entities
  next unless face.kind_of? Sketchup::Face
  if face.material
    summa[face.material.display_name] += face.area
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Ah, much better.</p>

<p>As I already mentioned, the first thing we need to do, is fix the obvious problem: replace <code>summa = {}</code> (which BTW would be the idiomatic way to write it) with <code>summa = Hash.new(0)</code>. Now, the code at least <em>works</em>.</p>

<p>As a next step, I would switch the assignment of the two local variables: first you assign <code>entities</code>, then you assign <code>summa</code>, then you do something with <code>entities</code> and you have to look three lines up to figure out what <code>entities</code> was. If you switch the two, the usage and the assignment of <code>entities</code> are right next to each other.</p>

<p>As a result, we see that <code>entities</code> is assigned, then immediately used and then never used again. I don't think this improves readability much, so we can get rid of it altogether:</p>

<pre><code>for face in Sketchup.active_model.entities
</code></pre>

<p>Next comes the <code>for</code> loop. Those are <em>highly</em> un-idiomatic in Ruby; Rubyists strongly prefer internal iterators. So, let's switch to one:</p>

<pre><code>Sketchup.active_model.entities.each {|face|
  next unless face.kind_of? Sketchup::Face
  if face.material
    summa[face.material.display_name] += face.area
  end
}
</code></pre>

<p>One advantage this has, is that now <code>face</code> is local to the body of the loop, whereas before, it was leaking out into the surrounding scope. (In Ruby, only module bodies, class bodies, method bodies, block bodies and script bodies have their own scope; <code>for</code> and <code>while</code> loop bodies as well as <code>if</code>/<code>unless</code>/<code>case</code> expressions don't.)</p>

<p>Let's get on to the body of the loop.</p>

<p>The first line is a guard clause. That's good, I like guard clauses :-)</p>

<p>The second line is, well, if <code>face.material</code> is true-ish, it does something otherwise it does nothing, which means the loop is over. So, it's <em>another</em> guard clause! However, it is written in a <em>totally</em> different style than the first guard clause, directly one line above it! Again, consistency is important:</p>

<pre><code>Sketchup.active_model.entities.each {|face|
  next unless face.kind_of? Sketchup::Face
  next unless face.material
  summa[face.material.display_name] += face.area
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now we have two guard clauses right next to each other. Let's simplify the logic:</p>

<pre><code>Sketchup.active_model.entities.each {|face|
  next unless face.kind_of? Sketchup::Face &amp;&amp; face.material
  summa[face.material.display_name] += face.area
}
</code></pre>

<p>But now there is only one single guard clause guarding only one single expression. So, we can just make the whole expression itself conditional:</p>

<pre><code>Sketchup.active_model.entities.each {|face|
  summa[face.material.display_name] += face.area if
    face.kind_of? Sketchup::Face &amp;&amp; face.material
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, that's still kind of ugly: we are looping over some collection, and then inside the loop we skip over all the items we don't want to loop over. So, if we don't want to loop over them, we do we loop over them in the first place? We don't we just select the ""interesting"" items first and then loop over just them?</p>

<pre><code>Sketchup.active_model.entities.select {|e|
  e.kind_of? Sketchup::Face &amp;&amp; e.material
}.each {|face|
  summa[face.material.display_name] += face.area
}
</code></pre>

<p>We can do some simplification on this. If we realize that <code>o.kind_of? C</code> is the same as <code>C === o</code>, then we can use the <code>grep</code> filter which uses <code>===</code> to pattern match, instead of <code>select</code>:</p>

<pre><code>Sketchup.active_model.entities.grep(Sketchup::Face).select {|e| e.material
}.each { … }
</code></pre>

<p>Our <code>select</code> filter can further be simplified by using <code>Symbol#to_proc</code>:</p>

<pre><code>Sketchup.active_model.entities.grep(Sketchup::Face).select(&amp;:material).each { … }
</code></pre>

<p>Now let's get back to the loop. Anybody who has some experience in a higher-order language such as Ruby, JavaScript, Python, C++ STL, C#, Visual Basic.NET, Smalltalk, Lisp, Scheme, Clojure, Haskell, Erlang, F#, Scala, &hellip; basically any modern language at all, will immediately recognize this pattern as a catamorphism, <code>reduce</code>, <code>fold</code>, <code>inject:into:</code>, <code>inject</code> or whatever your language of choice happens to call it.</p>

<p>What a <code>reduce</code> does, is basically it ""reduces"" several things into just one thing. The most obvious example is the sum of a list of numbers: it reduces several numbers into just one number:</p>

<pre><code>[4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42].reduce(0) {|accumulator, number| accumulator += number }
</code></pre>

<p>[Note: in idiomatic Ruby, this would be written just as <code>[4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42].reduce(:+)</code>.]</p>

<p>One way to spot a <code>reduce</code> lurking behind a loop is to look for the following pattern:</p>

<pre><code>accumulator = something # create an accumulator before the loop

collection.each {|element|
  # do something with the accumulator
}

# now, accumulator contains the result of what we were looking for
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, the <code>accumulator</code> is the <code>summa</code> hash.</p>

<pre><code>Sketchup.active_model.entities.grep(Sketchup::Face).select(&amp;:material).
reduce(Hash.new(0)) {|h, face|
  h[face.material.display_name] += face.area
  h
}
</code></pre>

<p>Last but not least, I don't like this explicit returning of <code>h</code> at the end of block. We could obviously write it on the same line:</p>

<pre><code>h[face.material.display_name] += face.area; h
</code></pre>

<p>But I prefer the use of <code>Object#tap</code> (aka the K-combinator) instead:</p>

<pre><code>Sketchup.active_model.entities.grep(Sketchup::Face).select(&amp;:material).
reduce(Hash.new(0)) {|h, face|
  h.tap {|h| h[face.material.display_name] += face.area }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And, that's it!</p>

"<p>Is there a way for programmatically accessing a method comments? or an attribute comments?</p>

<p>I would like to use it as a description for the method in a documentation which I don't want to be static or generated with rdoc or equivalent.</p>

<p>Here is an example of a Ruby class:</p>

<pre><code>Class MyClass
  ##
  # This method tries over and over until it is tired
  def go_go_go(thing_to_try, tries = 10) # :args: thing_to_try
    puts thing_to_try
    go_go_go thing_to_try, tries - 1
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Basically, I'd like to be able to do the following:</p>

<pre><code>get_comment MyClass.gogogo # =&gt; This method tries over and over until it is tired
</code></pre>
","2988","","<p>No, you cannot do this.</p>

<p><em>The whole point</em> of comments is that they are <em>not</em> part of the program! If you want a string that is part of your program, just use a string instead.</p>

<p>In most Ruby implementations, comments already get thrown away in the lexer, which means they don't even reach the <em>parser</em>, let alone the <em>interpreter</em> or compiler. At the time the code gets run, the comments are long gone &hellip; In fact, in implementations like Rubinius or YARV which use a compiler, there is simply no way to store the comments in the compiled executable, so even if they weren't thrown away by the lexer or the parser, there would <em>still</em> be no way to communicate them to the runtime.</p>

<p>So, pretty much your only chance is to parse the Ruby sourcefile to extract the comments. However, like I mentioned above, you cannot just take <em>any</em> parser, because most of the exisiting parsers throw comments away. (Which, again, is the <em>whole point</em> of comments, so there's nothing wrong with the parser throwing them away.) There are, however, Ruby parsers which preserve comments, most notably the ones used in tools such as RDoc or YARD.</p>

<p>YARD is especially interesting, because it also contains a query engine, which lets you search for and filter out documentation based on some powerful predicates like class name, method name, YARD tags, API version, type signature and so on.</p>

<p>However, if you <em>do</em> end up using RDoc or YARD for parsing, then why not use them in the first place?</p>

<p>Or, like I suggested above, if you want strings, just use strings:</p>

<pre><code>class Module
  private

  old_method_added = instance_method :method_added
  define_method :method_added do |meth|
    (@__doc__ ||= {})[meth] = @__last_doc__ if @__last_doc__
    @__last_doc__ = nil
    old_method_added.bind(self).(meth)
  end

  def doc(meth=nil, str)
    return @__doc__[meth] = str if meth
    @__last_doc__ = str
  end

  def defdoc(meth, doc, &amp;block)
    define_method(:meth, &amp;block)
    @__doc__[meth] = doc
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>This gives us a method <code>Module#doc</code> which we can use to document either an already existing method by calling it with the name of the method and a docstring, or you can use it to document the very next method you define. It does this by storing the docstring in a temporary instance variable and then defining a <code>method_added</code> hook that looks at that instance variable and stores its content in the documentation hash.</p>

<p>There is also the <code>Module#defdoc</code> method which defines and documents the method in one go.</p>

<pre><code>module Kernel
  private

  def get_doc(klass, meth)
    klass.instance_variable_get(:@__doc__)[meth]
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>This is your <code>Kernel#get_doc</code> method which gets the documentation back out (or <code>nil</code> if the method is undocumented).</p>

<pre><code>class MyClass
  doc 'This method tries over and over until it is tired'
  def go_go_go(thing_to_try, tries = 10)
    puts thing_to_try
    go_go_go thing_to_try, tries - 1
  end

  def some_other_meth; end # Oops, I forgot to document it!

  # No problem:
  doc :some_other_meth, 'Does some other things'

  defdoc(:yet_another_method, 'This method also does something') do |a, b, c|
    p a, b, c
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Here you see the three different ways of documenting a method.</p>

<p>Oh, and it works:</p>

<pre><code>require 'test/unit'
class TestDocstrings &lt; Test::Unit::TestCase
  def test_that_myclass_gogogo_has_a_docstring
    doc = 'This method tries over and over until it is tired'
    assert_equal doc, get_doc(MyClass, :go_go_go)
  end
  def test_that_myclass_some_other_meth_has_a_docstring
    doc = 'Does some other things'
    assert_equal doc, get_doc(MyClass, :some_other_meth)
  end
  def test_that_myclass_yet_another_method_has_a_docstring
    doc = 'This method also does something'
    assert_equal doc, get_doc(MyClass, :yet_another_method)
  end
  def test_that_undocumented_methods_return_nil
    assert_nil get_doc(MyClass, :does_not_exist)
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Note: this is pretty hacky. For example, there is no locking, so if two threads define methods for the same class at the same time, the documentation might get screwed up. (I.e.: the docstring might be attributed to the wrong method or get lost.)</p>

<p>I believe that <code>rake</code> does essentially the same thing with its <code>desc</code> method, and that codebase is <em>much</em> better tested than this, so if you intend to use it in production, I'd steal Jim's code instead of mine.</p>

"<p>I'm designing a custom VM and am curious about how many registers I should use. Initially, I had 255, but I'm a little concerned about backing 255 pointers (a whole KB) on to the stack or heap every time I call a function, when most of them won't even be used. How many registers should I use?</p>
","2988","","<p>Whatever number of registers you choose, you are probably going to have way too many for most subroutines and way too few for a few subroutines. (This is just a guess. However, considering how many things in programming follow a Power Law Distribution&nbsp;&ndash; incoming references to objects, modules, classes, outgoing references from objects, modules, classes, cyclomatic complexity of subroutines, NPath complexity of subroutines, SLOC length of subroutines, lifetime of objects, size of objects&nbsp;&ndash; it is only reasonable to assume that the same is true for the number of registers for a subroutine, especially if you consider that there is probably a correlation between complexity/length and number of registers.)</p>

<p>The Parrot VM has found quite a simple way out of this conundrum: they have an <em>infinite</em> number of registers. Obviously, those registers aren't stored in an infinite array, rather they lazily materialize just enough registers for any single subroutine. That way, they never run out of registers, and they never waste any space.</p>

"<p>I just started out using IronRuby (but the behaviour seems consistent when I tested it in plain Ruby) for a DSL in my .NET application - and as part of this I'm defining methods to be called from the DSL via define_method.</p>

<p>However, I've run into an issue regarding optional parens when calling methods starting with an uppercase letter.</p>

<p>Given the following program:</p>

<pre><code>class DemoClass
    define_method :test do puts ""output from test"" end
    define_method :Test do puts ""output from Test"" end

    def run
        puts ""Calling 'test'""
        test()
        puts ""Calling 'test'""
        test
        puts ""Calling 'Test()'""
        Test()
        puts ""Calling 'Test'""
        Test
    end
end

demo = DemoClass.new
demo.run
</code></pre>

<p>Running this code in a console (using plain ruby) yields the following output:</p>

<pre><code>ruby .\test.rb
Calling 'test'
output from test
Calling 'test'
output from test
Calling 'Test()'
output from Test
Calling 'Test'
./test.rb:13:in `run': uninitialized constant DemoClass::Test (NameError)
    from ./test.rb:19:in `&lt;main&gt;'
</code></pre>

<p>I realize that the Ruby convention is that constants start with an uppercase letter and that the general naming convention for methods in Ruby is lowercase. But the parens are really killing my DSL syntax at the moment.</p>

<p>Is there any way around this issue? </p>
","2988","","<p>This is just part of Ruby's ambiguity resolution.</p>

<p>In Ruby, methods and variables live in different namespaces, therefore there can be methods and variables (or constants) with the same name. This means that, when <em>using</em> them, there needs to be some way to distinguish them. In general, that's not a problem: messages have receivers, variables don't. Messages have arguments, variables don't. Variables are assigned to, messages aren't.</p>

<p>The only problem is when you have no receiver, no argument and no assignment. Then, Ruby cannot tell the difference between a receiverless message send without arguments and a variable. So, it has to make up some arbitrary rules, and those rules are basically:</p>

<ul>
<li>for an ambiguous token starting with a lowercase letter, prefer to interpret it as a message send, <em>unless</em> you positively know it is a variable (i.e. the <em>parser</em> (not(!) the interpreter) has seen an assignment before)</li>
<li>for an ambiguous token starting with an uppercase letter, prefer to interpret it as a constant</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that for a message send with arguments (even if the argument list is empty), there is no ambiguity, which is why your third example works.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>test()</code>: obviously a message send, no ambiguity here</li>
<li><code>test</code>: might be a message send or a variable; resolution rules say it is a message send</li>
<li><code>Test()</code>: obviously a message send, no ambiguity here</li>
<li><code>self.Test</code>: <em>also</em> obviously a message send, no ambiguity here</li>
<li><code>Test</code>: might be a message send or a constant; resolution rules say it is a constant</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that those rules are a little bit subtle, for example here:</p>

<pre><code>if false
  foo = 'This will never get executed'
end

foo # still this will get interpreted as a variable
</code></pre>

<p>The rules say that whether an ambiguous token gets interpreted as a variable or a message send is determined by the <em>parser</em> and not the interpreter. So, because the parser has seen <code>foo = whatever</code>, it tags <code>foo</code> as a variable, even though the code will never get executed and <code>foo</code> will evaluate to <code>nil</code> as all uninitialized variables in Ruby do.</p>

<p>TL;DR summary: you're SOL.</p>

<p>What you <em>could</em> do is override <code>const_missing</code> to translate into a message send. Something like this:</p>

<pre><code>class DemoClass
  def test; puts ""output from test"" end
  def Test; puts ""output from Test"" end

  def run
    puts ""Calling 'test'""
    test()
    puts ""Calling 'test'""
    test
    puts ""Calling 'Test()'""
    Test()
    puts ""Calling 'Test'""
    Test
  end

  def self.const_missing(const)
    send const.downcase
  end
end

demo = DemoClass.new
demo.run
</code></pre>

<p>Except this obviously won't work, since <code>const_missing</code> is defined on <code>DemoClass</code> and thus, when <code>const_missing</code> is run, <code>self</code> is <code>DemoClass</code> which means that it tries to call <code>DemoClass.test</code> when it should be calling <code>DemoClass#test</code> via <code>demo.test</code>.</p>

<p>I don't know how to easily solve this.</p>

"<p>Besides just using <code>yield</code> for iterators in Ruby, I also use it to pass control briefly back to the caller before resuming control in the called method.  What I want to do in C# is similar.  In a test class, I want to get a connection instance, create another variable instance that uses that connection, then pass the variable to the calling method so it can be fiddled with.  I then want control to return to the called method so that the connection can be disposed.  I guess I'm wanting a block/closure like in Ruby.  Here's the general idea:</p>

<pre><code>private static MyThing getThing()

{

    // for disposal
}

...

<p>This doesn't work in C#; ReSharper tells me that the body of <code>getThing</code> cannot be an iterator block because <code>MyThing</code> is not an iterator interface type.  That's definitely true, but I don't want to iterate through some list.  I'm guessing I shouldn't use <code>yield</code> if I'm not working with iterators.  Any idea how I can achieve this block/closure thing in C# so I don't have to wrap my code in <code>MyTest1</code>, <code>MyTest2</code>, ... with the code in <code>getThing()</code>'s body?</p>
","2988","","<p>You say you want to use C#'s <code>yield</code> keyword the same way you would use Ruby's <code>yield</code> keyword. You seem to be a little confused about what the two actually do: the two have absolutely <em>nothing</em> to do with each other, what you are asking for, is simply not possible.</p>

<p>The C# <code>yield</code> keyword is <em>not</em> the C# equivalent of the Ruby <code>yield</code> keyword. In fact, there <em>is no</em> equivalent to the Ruby <code>yield</code> keyword in C#. And the Ruby equivalent to C#'s <code>yield</code> keyword is <em>not</em> the <code>yield</code> <em>keyword</em>, it's the <code>Enumerator::Yielder#yield</code> <em>method</em> (also aliased as <code>Enumerator::Yielder#&lt;&lt;</code>).</p>

<p>IOW, it's for returning the next element of an iterator. Here's an abridged example from the official MSDN documentation:</p>

<pre><code>public static IEnumerable Power(int number, int exponent) {
    var counter = 0;
    var result = 1;
    while (counter++ &lt; exponent) {
        result = result * number;

</code></pre>

<p>Use it like so:</p>

<pre><code>foreach (int i in Power(2, 8)) { Console.Write(""{0} "", i); }

<p>The Ruby equivalent would be something like:</p>

<pre><code>def power(number, exponent)
  Enumerator.new do |yielder|
    result = 1
    1.upto(exponent-1) { yielder.yield result *= number } end end

puts power(2, 8).to_a
</code></pre>

<p>In C#, <code>yield</code> is used to yield a <em>value</em> to the <em>caller</em> and in Ruby, <code>yield</code> is used to yield <em>control</em> to a <em>block argument</em></p>

<p>In fact, in Ruby, <code>yield</code> is just a shortcut for <code>Proc#call</code>.</p>

<p>Imagine, if <code>yield</code> didn't exist. How would you write an <code>if</code> method in Ruby? It would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>class TrueClass
  def if(code)
    code.call
  end
end

class FalseClass
  def if(_); end
end

true.if(lambda { puts ""It's true!"" })
</code></pre>

<p>This is kind of cumbersome. In Ruby 1.9, we get proc literals and a shortcut syntax for <code>Proc#call</code>, which make it a little bit nicer:</p>

<pre><code>class TrueClass
  def if(code)
    code.()
  end
end

true.if(-&gt;{ puts ""It's true!' })
</code></pre>

<p>However, Yukihiro Matsumoto noticed, that the <em>vast</em> majority of higher-order procedures only take <em>one</em> procedure argument. (Especially since Ruby has several control-flow constructs built into the language, which would otherwise require multiple procedure arguments, like <code>if-then-else</code> which would require two and <code>case-when</code> which would require n arguments.) So, he created a specialized way to pass <em>exactly one</em> procedural argument: the block. (In fact, we already saw an example of this at the very beginning, because <code>Kernel#lambda</code> is actually just a normal method which takes a block and returns a <code>Proc</code>.)</p>

<pre><code>class TrueClass
  def if(&amp;code)
    code.()
  end
end

true.if { puts ""It's true!"" }
</code></pre>

<p>Now, since we can only ever pass exactly one block into a method, we really don't need to explicitly name the variable, since there can never be an ambiguity anyway:</p>

<pre><code>def if
  ???.() # But what do we put here? We don't have a name to call #call on!
end
</code></pre>

<p>However, since we now no longer have a name that we can send messages to, we need some other way. And again, we get one of those 80/20 solutions that are so typical for Ruby: there are <em>tons</em> of things that one might want to do with a block: transform it, store it in an attribute, pass it to another method, inspect it, print it &hellip; However, by <em>far</em> the most common thing to do is to call it. So, matz added another specialized shortcut syntax for exactly this common case: <code>yield</code> means ""<code>call</code> the block that was passed to the method"". Therefore, we don't need a name:</p>

<pre><code>def if; yield end
</code></pre>

<p>So, what <em>is</em> the C# equivalent to Ruby's <code>yield</code> keyword? Well, let's go back to the first Ruby example, where we explicitly passed the procedure as an argument:</p>

<pre><code>def foo(bar)
  bar.('StackOverflow')
end

foo -&gt;name { puts ""Higher-order Hello World from #{name}!"" }
</code></pre>

<p>The C# equivalent is <em>exactly</em> the same:</p>

<pre><code>void Foo(Action&lt;string&gt; bar)
{
    bar(""StackOverflow"");
}

Foo(name =&gt; { Console.WriteLine(""Higher-order Hello World from {0]!"", name); })
</code></pre>

"<p>i wonder if there is a php equivalent to jython so you can use java classes with php?</p>

<p>thanks</p>
","2988","","<p>I'm not quite sure what you are asking, since you are talking about two completely different things: a PHP equivalent to Jython, and accessing Java classes from PHP. So, I'm going to answer both.</p>

<p>Jython is a Python implementation for the JVM. So, the PHP equivalent would be a PHP implementation for the JVM. There are actually two that I know of: IBM's P8, which is part of <a href=""http://ProjectZero.Org/"" rel=""nofollow"">Project Zero</a> and <a href=""http://Quercus.Caucho.Com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Quercus</a>.</p>

<p>However, you don't need to run your PHP <em>on</em> Java if you want to run it <em>with</em> Java. A PHP-to-Java <em>bridge</em> would be enough, you don't need a PHP-on-Java <em>implementation</em>. I know that at some point in the past at least one such bridge must have existed, because someone once told me that they used one, but that is about all I know.</p>

<p>So, the code gets simplified to:</p>

","2988","","<p>Can you be a little bit more specific? Ruby on Rails runs on .NET, why do you want a Ruby-on-Rails-<em>like</em> framework but not Ruby on Rails?</p>

<p>EDIT: I don't quite understand the downvote. I believe that Ruby on Rails meets every single one of the OP's criteria perfectly:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is there a Ruby on Rails framework like equivalent</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Check: Ruby on Rails is <em>definitely</em> Ruby-on-Rails-like. In fact, of all the answers given so far, I would claim that Ruby on Rails is the <em>most</em> Ruby-on-Rails-like framework, much more so than the currently highest voted answer.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>for .NET development?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Check: Ruby is a .NET language, Ruby on Rails runs on .NET, there is a Rack adatper for Internet Information Server, there is an ActiveRecord Adapter for SQL Server, Ruby on Rails is for all intents and purposes a 100% native .NET citizen.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Answers like ASP.NET MVC or Entity Framework really aren't acceptable as they address just one aspect of the problem domain.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the question doesn't specify what ""the problem domain"" <em>is</em>, but it seems that the OP thinks that Ruby on Rails <em>does</em> address all aspects of the problem domain, so: Check.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Check: Ruby on Rails <em>does</em> give you the same features out of the box that Ruby on Rails does.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As such it should include at minimum:</p>
  
  <p>MVC for presentation</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Check: Ruby on Rails does provide MVC for presentation. It has ActiveRecord for the model layer, ActionView for the view layer and ActionController for the controller layer, although every single one of those can be swapped out for a different implementation if you don't like them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ORM</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Check: Ruby on Rails does come with an ORM called ActiceRecord, but if you don't like it, then you can swap it out for DataMapper, Sequel or really any ORM you want. Also, Ruby on Rails doesn't <em>require</em> a relational database <em>at all</em>, it works just as well with hierarchical databases, document databases, key-value databases and graph databases.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ability to provide simple configuration for whatever environment (dev, QA, Production, etc...)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Check: Ruby on Rails comes with a couple of environments built in (development, test and production), but you can add your own and you can provide configuration for any one of them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Migration like functionality</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Check: ActiveRecord comes with a database migration framework.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ability to generate code in all layers (similar to scaffolding like behavior, etc...)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Check: Ruby on Rails comes with the Rails Generator framework, which allows customizable generation of pretty much anything, and it comes with a whole bunch of predefined generators for models, controllers, views, migrations, tests, &hellip;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Project template so as to create similar functionality as the ""rails my_app"" command.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Check: Ruby on Rails comes with Rails Templates which allow you to create customizable project templates which can generate an entire skeleton project with a single command. It also comes with a predefined template which generates a project with ActiveRecord as the model, ActionController as the controller, ActionView as the view, ERb as the templating library, Prototype as the AJAX library and <code>test/unit</code> as the test framework.</p>

<p>Ruby on Rails meets every single one of the criteria in the question, and IMHO it meets them better than any other framework that has been suggested so far, including the currently highest voted answer.</p>

"<p>i am getting response from server in utf-8 but not able to read that.
how to convert utf-8 to ASCII in c++?</p>
","2988","","<p>If the string contains characters which do not exist in ASCII, then there is nothing you <strong>can</strong> do, because, well, those characters do not exist in ASCII.</p>

<p>If the string contains <em>only</em> characters which <em>do</em> exist in ASCII, then there is nothing you <strong>need</strong> to do, because the string is <em>already</em> in the ASCII encoding: UTF-8 was specifically designed to be backwards-compatible with ASCII in such a way that any character which is in ASCII has the exact same encoding in UTF-8 as it has in ASCII, and that any character which is <em>not</em> in ASCII can <em>never</em> have an encoding which is valid ASCII, i.e. will <em>always</em> have an encoding which is illegal in ASCII (specifically, any non-ASCII character will be encoded as a sequence of 2&ndash;4 octets all of which have their most significant bit set, i.e. have an integer value > 127).</p>

<p>Instead of simply trying to <em>convert</em> the string, you could try to <em>transliterate</em> the string. Most languages on this planet have some form of ASCII transliteration scheme that at least keeps the text somewhat comprehensible. For example, my first name is ""Jörg"" and its ASCII transliteration would be ""Joerg"". The name of the creator of the Ruby Programming Language is ""まつもとゆきひろ"" and its ASCII transliteration would be ""Matsumoto Yukihiro"". However, please note that you <em>will</em> lose information. For example, the German sz-ligature gets transliterated to ""ss"", so the word ""Maße"" (measurements) gets transliterated to ""Masse"". However, ""Masse"" (mass, in the physicist's sense, not the Christian's) is <em>also</em> a word. As another example, Turkish has 4 ""i""s (small and capital, with and without dot) and ASCII only has 2 (small with dot and capital without dot), therefore you will either lose information about the dot or whether or not it was a capital letter.</p>

<p>So, the <em>only</em> way which will not lose information (in other words: corrupt data), is to somehow <em>encode</em> the non-ASCII characters into sequences of ASCII characters. There are many popular encoding schemes: SGML entity references, MIME, Unicode escape sequences, &#932;<sub>&Epsilon;</sub>&Chi; or La&#932;<sub>&Epsilon;</sub>&Chi;. So, you would encode the data as it enters your system and decode it when it leaves the system.</p>

<p>Of course, the <em>easiest</em> way would be to simply fix your system.</p>

Variables are assigned to, messages aren't.</p>

<p>The only problem is when you have no receiver, no argument and no assignment. Then, Ruby cannot tell the difference between a receiverless message send without arguments and a variable. So, it has to make up some arbitrary rules, and those rules are basically:</p>

<ul>
<li>for an ambiguous token starting with a lowercase letter, prefer to interpret it as a message send, <em>unless</em> you positively know it is a variable (i.e. the <em>parser</em> (not(!) the interpreter) has seen an assignment before)</li>

"<p>I've been given to understand that Python is an interpreted language... however, when I look at my Python source code I see .pyc files, which Windows identifies as ""Compiled Python Files"". Where do these come in?</p>
","2988","","<p>There is no such thing as an interpreted language. Whether an interpreter or a compiler is used is purely a trait of the <em>implementation</em> and has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with the language.</p>

<p><em>Every</em> language can be implemented by either an interpreter or a compiler. The vast majority of languages have at least one implementation of each type. (For example, there are interpreters for C and C++ and there are compilers for JavaScript, PHP, Perl, Python and Ruby.) Besides, the majority of modern language implementations actually combine both an interpreter and a compiler (or even multiple compilers).</p>

<p>A language is just a set of abstract mathematical rules. An interpreter is one of several concrete implementation strategies for a language. Those two live on completely different abstraction levels. If English were a typed language, the term ""interpreted language"" would be a type error. The statement ""Python is an interpreted language"" is not just false (because being false would imply that the statement even makes sense, even if it is wrong), it just plain doesn't make <em>sense</em>, because a language can <em>never</em> be interpreted.</p>

<p>In particular, if you look at the currently existing Python implementations, these are the implementation strategies they are using:</p>

<ul>
<li>IronPython: compiles to DLR trees which the DLR then compiles to CIL bytecode. What happens to the CIL bytecode depends upon which CLI VES you are running on, but Microsoft .NET, GNU Portable.NET and Novell Mono will eventually compile it to native machine code.</li>
<li>Jython: interprets Python sourcecode until it identifies the hot code paths, which it then compiles to JVML bytecode. What happens to the JVML bytecode depends upon which JVM you are running on. Maxine will directly compile it to un-optimized native code until it identifies the hot code paths, which it then recompiles to optimized native code. HotSpot will first interpret the JVML bytecode and then eventually compile the hot code paths to optimized machine code.</li>
<li>PyPy: compiles to PyPy bytecode, which then gets interpreted by the PyPy VM until it identifies the hot code paths which it then compiles into native code, JVML bytecode or CIL bytecode depending on which platform you are running on.</li>
<li>CPython: compiles to CPython bytecode which it then interprets.</li>
<li>Stackless Python: compiles to CPython bytecode which it then interprets.</li>
<li>Unladen Swallow: compiles to CPython bytecode which it then interprets until it identifies the hot code paths which it then compiles to LLVM IR which the LLVM compiler then compiles to native machine code.</li>
</ul>

<p>You might notice that every single one of the implementations in that list (plus some others I didn't mention, like tinypy, Shedskin or Psyco) has a compiler. In fact, as far as I know, there is currently no Python implementation which is purely interpreted, there is no such implementation planned and there never has been such an implementation.</p>

<p>Not only does the term ""interpreted language"" not make sense, even if you interpret it as meaning ""language with interpreted implementation"", it is clearly not true. Whoever told you that, obviously doesn't know what he is talking about.</p>

<p>In particular, the <code>.pyc</code> files you are seeing are cached bytecode files produced by CPython, Stackless Python or Unladen Swallow.</p>

<p>I`m looking for a calculator software (not a hardware one), to help with base conversions, but it must also support scientific calc. Can anyone help on this?</p>

<p>Since this subject is intended to help programmers, I did not ask this in SuperUser.com.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

"<p>I have a method that returns an array of arrays.
For convenience I use collect on a collection to gather them together.</p>

<pre><code>arr = collection.collect {|item| item.get_array_of_arrays}
</code></pre>

<p>Now I would like to have a single array that contains all the arrays.
Of course I can loop over the array and use the + operator to do that.</p>

<pre><code>newarr = []    
arr.each {|item| newarr += item}
</code></pre>

<p>But this is kind of ugly, is there a better way?</p>
","2988","","<p>There is a method for flattening an array in Ruby: <code>Array#flatten</code>:</p>

<pre><code>newarr = arr.flatten(1)
</code></pre>

<p>From your description it actually looks like you don't care about <code>arr</code> anymore, so there is no need to keep the old value of <code>arr</code> around, we can just modify it:</p>

<pre><code>arr.flatten!(1)
</code></pre>

<p>(There is a rule in Ruby that says that if you have two methods that do basically the same thing, but one does it in a somewhat surprising way, you name that method the same as the other method but with an exlamation point at the end. In this case, both methods flatten an array, but the version with the exclamation point does it by destroying the original array.)</p>

<p>However, while in this particular case there actually is a method which does exactly what you want, there is a more general principle at work in your code: you have a sequence of things and you iterate over it and try to ""reduce"" it down into a single thing. In this case, it is hard to see, because you start out with an array and you end up with an array. But by changing just a couple of small details in your code, it all of the sudden becomes blindingly obvious:</p>

<pre><code>sum = 0
arr.each {|item| sum += item } # assume arr is an array of numbers
</code></pre>

<p>This is exactly the same pattern.</p>

<p>What you are trying to do is known as a <em>catamorphism</em> in category theory, a <em>fold</em> in mathematics, a <em>reduce</em> in functional programming, <code>inject:into:</code> in Smalltalk and is implemented by <code>Enumerable#inject</code> and its alias <code>Enumerable#reduce</code> (or in this case actually <code>Array#inject</code> and <code>Array#reduce</code>) in Ruby.</p>

<p>It is very easy to spot: whenever you initialize an accumulator variable outside of a loop and then assign to it or modify the object it references during every iteration of the loop, then you have a case for <code>reduce</code>.</p>

<p>In this particular case, your accumulator is <code>newarr</code> and the operation is adding an array to it.</p>

<p>So, your loop could be more idiomatically rewritten like this:</p>

<pre><code>newarr = arr.reduce(:+)
</code></pre>

<p>An experienced Rubyist would of course see this right away. However, even a newbie would eventually get there, by following some simple refactoring steps, probably similar to this:</p>

<p>First, you realize that it actually <em>is</em> a fold:</p>

<pre><code>newarr = arr.reduce([]) {|acc, el| acc += el }
</code></pre>

<p>Next, you realize that assigning to <code>acc</code> is completely unnecessary, because <code>reduce</code> overwrites the contents of <code>acc</code> <em>anyway</em> with the result value of each iteration:</p>

<pre><code>newarr = arr.reduce([]) {|acc, el| acc + el }
</code></pre>

<p>Thirdly, there is no need to inject an empty array as the starting value for the first iteration, since all the elements of <code>arr</code> are already arrays anyway:</p>

<pre><code>newarr = arr.reduce {|acc, el| acc + el }
</code></pre>

<p>This can, of course, be further simplified by using <code>Symbol#to_proc</code>:</p>

<pre><code>newarr = arr.reduce(&amp;:+)
</code></pre>

<p>And actually, we don't need <code>Symbol#to_proc</code> here, because <code>reduce</code> and <code>inject</code> already accept a symbol parameter for the operation:</p>

<pre><code>newarr = arr.reduce(:+)
</code></pre>

<p>This really <em>is</em> a general pattern. If you remember the <code>sum</code> example above, it would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>sum = arr.reduce(:+)
</code></pre>

<p>There is no change in the code, except for the variable name.</p>

<p>I threw some type conversion code in there, just for fun. If you don't want that, the loop body becomes even simpler:</p>

<pre><code>  k, *v = l.split
  hsh.tap {|hsh| hsh[k] = v }
</code></pre>

<p>You can also use <code>readlines</code> instead of <code>foreach</code>. Note that <code>IO#readlines</code> reads the entire file into an array <em>first</em>. So, you need enough memory to hold both the entire array and the entire hash. (Of course, the array will be eligible for garbage collection as soon as the loop finishes.)</p>

"<p>So... I'm new to scheme r6rs, and am learning macros. Can somebody explain to me what is meant by 'hygiene'?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
","2988","","<p>If you imagine that a macro is simply expanded into the place where it is used, then you can also imagine that if you use a variable <code>a</code> in your macro, there might already <em>be</em> a variable <code>a</code> defined at the place where that macro is used.</p>

<p>This is <em>not</em> the <code>a</code> that you want!</p>

<p>A macro system in which something like this cannot happen, is called <em>hygienic</em>.</p>

<p>There are several ways to deal with this problem. One way is simply to use very long, very cryptic, very unpredictable variable names in your macros.</p>

<p>A slightly more refined version of this is the <code>gensym</code> approach used by some other macro systems: instead of <em>you</em>, the programmer coming up with a very long, very cryptic, very unpredictable variable name, you can call the <code>gensym</code> function which generates a very long, very cryptic, very unpredictable and unique variable name <em>for you</em>.</p>

<p>And like I said, in a hygienic macro system, such collisions cannot happen in the first place. <em>How</em> to make a macro system hygienic is an interesting question in itself, and the Scheme community has spent several decades on this question, and they keep coming up with better and better ways to do it.</p>

<p>Catch that? The constant was appended to at the same time the local variable was.</p>

<p>Known behavior? Expected?</p>
","2988","","<blockquote>
  <p>Catch that? The constant was appended to at the same time the local variable was.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, it wasn't appended to, and neither was the local variable.</p>

<p>The <em>single</em> object that <em>both</em> the constant and the local variable are referring to was appended to, but neither the constant nor the local variable was changed. You cannot modify or change a variable or constant in Ruby (at least not in the way that your question implies), the only thing you <em>can</em> change is objects.</p>

<p>The only two things you <em>can</em> do with variables or constants is dereferencing them and assigning to them.</p>

<p>The constant is a red herring here, it is completely irrelevant to the example given. The only thing that is relevant is that there is only <em>one</em> single object in the entire example. That single object is accessible under two different names. If the object changes, then the object changes. Period. It does not mysteriously split itself in two. Which name you use to look at the changed object doesn't matter. There is only one object anyway.</p>

<p>This works exactly the same as in any other programming language: if you have multiple references to a mutable object in, say, Python, Java, C#, C++, C, Lisp, Smalltalk, JavaScript, PHP, Perl or whatever, then any change to that object will be visible no matter what reference is used, even if some of those references are <code>final</code> or <code>const</code> or whatever that particular language calls it.</p>

<p>This is simply how shared mutable state works and is just one of the many reasons why shared mutable state is bad.</p>

<p>In Ruby, you can generally call the <code>freeze</code> method on any object to make it immutable. However, again, you are modifying the <em>object</em> here, so anybody else who has a reference to that object will all the sudden find that the object has become immutable. Therefore, just to be safe, you need to copy the object first, by calling <code>dup</code>. But of course, that's not enough either, if you think of an array, for example: if you <code>dup</code> the array, you get a different <em>array</em>, but the objects <em>inside</em> the array are the still the same ones in the original array. And if you <code>freeze</code> the array, then you can no longer modify the <em>array</em>, but the objects <em>in</em> the array may very well still be mutable:</p>

<pre><code>ORIG = ['Hello']
CLONE = ORIG.dup.freeze
CLONE[0] &lt;&lt; ', World!'
CLONE # =&gt; ['Hello, World!']
</code></pre>

<p>That's shared mutable state for you. The only way to escape this madness is either to give up shared state (e.g. Actor Programming: if nobody else can see it, then it doesn't matter how often or when it changes) or mutable state (i.e. Functional Programming: if it never changes, then it doesn't matter how many others see it).</p>

<p>The fact that one of the two variables in the original example is actually a constant is completely irrelevant to the problem. There two main differences between a variable and a constant in Ruby: they have different lookup rules, and constants generate a warning if they are assigned to more than once. But in this example, the lookup rules are irrelevant and the constant is assigned to only once, so there really is no difference between a variable and a constant in this case.</p>

              text+=""\""#{arrayKey}\"":\""#{arrayValue}\"","" 
        end
       }
  end

</code></pre>
","2988","","<p>It looks like all your code is ultimately doing is this:</p>

<pre><code>require 'json'

def mine_location
  client = Yelp::Client.new
  request = Yelp::Review::Request::GeoPoint.new(latitude: 13.3125,
    longitude: -6.2468, yws_id: 'nicetry')
  response = client.search(request)

  return response['businesses'].to_json
end
</code></pre>

<p>Which works just fine for me.</p>

<p>If, for whatever reason you really <em>must</em> write your own implementation of a JSON emitter, here's a couple of tips for you.</p>

<p>The number 1 thing you completely ignore in your code is that Ruby is an object-oriented language, more specifically a class-based object-oriented language. This means that problems are solved by constructing a network of objects that communicate with each other via message passing and respond to those messages by executing methods defined in classes to which those objects belong.</p>

<p>This gives us a lot of power: dynamic dispatch, polymorphism, encapsulation and a ton of others. Leveraging those, your JSON emitter would look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>class Object
  def to_json; to_s                                                         end
end

class NilClass
  def to_json; 'null'                                                       end
end

class String
  def to_json; %Q'""#{to_s}""'                                                end
end

class Array
  def to_json; ""[#{map(&amp;:to_json).join(', ')}]""                             end
end

class Hash
  def to_json; ""{#{map {|k, v| ""#{k.to_json}: #{v.to_json}"" }.join(', ')}}"" end
end
</code></pre>

<p><code>mine_location</code> looks just like above, except obviously without the <code>require 'json'</code> part.</p>

<p>If you want your JSON nicely formatted, you could try something like this:</p>

<pre><code>class Object
  def to_json(*) to_s    end
end

class String
  def to_json(*) inspect end
end

class Array
  def to_json(indent=0)
    ""[\n#{'  ' * indent+=1}#{
      map {|el| el.to_json(indent) }.join("", \n#{'  ' * indent}"")
    }\n#{'  ' * indent-=1}]""
  end
end

class Hash
  def to_json(indent=0)
    ""{\n#{'  ' * indent+=1}#{
      map {|k, v|
        ""#{k.to_json(indent)}: #{v.to_json(indent)}""
      }.join("", \n#{'  ' * indent}"")
    }\n#{'  ' * indent-=1}}""
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>There's actually nothing Ruby-specific in this code. This is pretty much <em>exactly</em> what the solution would look like in any other class-based object-oriented language like Java, for example. It's just object-oriented design 101.</p>

<p>The only thing which is language-specific is how to ""modify"" classes and add methods to them. In Ruby or Python, you literally just modify the class. In C# and Visual Basic.NET, you would probably use extension methods, in Scala you would use implicit conversions and in Java maybe the Decorator Design Pattern.</p>

<p>Another <em>huge</em> problem with your code is that you are trying to solve a problem which is <em>obviously</em> recursive without actually ever recursing. This just <em>can't</em> work. The code you wrote is basically Fortran-57 code: procedural with no objects and no recursion. Even just moving <em>one</em> step up from Fortran to, say, Pascal, gives you a nice recursive procedural solution:</p>

<pre><code>def jsonify(o)
  case o
  when Hash
    ""{#{o.map {|k, v| ""#{jsonify(k)}: #{jsonify(v)}"" }.join(', ')}}""
  when Array
    ""[#{o.map(&amp;method(:jsonify)).join(', ')}]""
  when String
    o.inspect
  when nil
    'null'
  else
    o.to_s
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, you can play the same game with indentations here:</p>

<pre><code>def jsonify(o, indent=0)
  case o
  when Hash
    ""{\n#{'  ' * indent+=1}#{
      o.map {|k, v|
        ""#{jsonify(k, indent)}: #{jsonify(v, indent)}""
      }.join("", \n#{'  ' * indent}"") }\n#{'  ' * indent-=1}}""
  when Array
    ""[\n#{'  ' * indent+=1}#{
      o.map {|el| jsonify(el, indent) }.join("", \n#{'  ' * indent}"") }\n#{'  ' * indent-=1}]""
  when String
    o.inspect
  when nil
    'null'
  else
    o.to_s
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Here's the indented output of <code>puts mine_location</code>, produced using either the second (indented) version of <code>to_json</code> or the second version of <code>jsonify</code>, it doesn't really matter, they both have the same output:</p>

"<p>For example this what I am trying to do,</p>

<pre><code>def method_a(condition, params={}, &amp;block)
   if condition
      method_b(params, &amp;block)
   else
      yield
   end
end
</code></pre>

<p>and I am trying to call the method like this,</p>

<pre><code>method_a(#{@date &gt; Date.today}, {:param1 =&gt; 'value1', :param2 =&gt; 'value2'}) do

end
</code></pre>

<p>The result is the condition is always evaluated to true. How do I make it work?</p>
","2988","","<p>Actually, if you didn't have that comment there in the middle of the line, it would pretty much just work:</p>

<pre><code>method_a(@date &gt; Date.today, {:param1 =&gt; 'value1', :param2 =&gt; 'value2'}) do; end
</code></pre>

<p>By the way: if the very last argument to a method is a hash, you can leave off the curly braces, which makes it read almost like Python-style keyword arguments:</p>

<pre><code>method_a(@date &gt; Date.today, :param1 =&gt; 'value1', :param2 =&gt; 'value2') do; end
</code></pre>

<p>If you use Ruby 1.9, and you have a hash where the keys are symbols, you can use the new alternative hash syntax:</p>

<pre><code>method_a(@date &gt; Date.today, {param1: 'value1', param2: 'value2'}) do; end
</code></pre>

<p>Combining the two <em>really</em> looks like keyword arguments:</p>

<pre><code>method_a(@date &gt; Date.today, param1: 'value1', param2: 'value2') do; end
</code></pre>

<p>In your <code>method_a</code>, you could greatly improve the readability by using a guard clause instead of the big honking <code>if</code> expression:</p>

<pre><code>def method_a(condition, params={}, &amp;block)
  return method_b(params, &amp;block) if condition
  yield
end
</code></pre>

<p>Or the other way around, whichever you think reads better:</p>

<pre><code>def method_a(condition, params={}, &amp;block)
  return yield unless condition
  method_b(params, &amp;block)
end
</code></pre>

<p>However, this is a giant code smell. A method should <em>always</em> do one thing, and one thing only. <em>Every</em> method which takes a boolean argument violates this rule, because it pretty much by definition does <em>two</em> things: one thing if the condition is true and a different thing if the condition is false.</p>

<p>In your original code, this is blatantly obvious, because you have the giant <code>if</code> expression surrounding the entire method and the code in the two branches is <em>completely</em> different. It is even more obvious than that, because the <code>else</code> branch not only has completely different code than the <code>then</code> branch, it also completely ignores the arguments that are passed into the method! So, not only does the method behave differently depending on the condition, it even has a different <em>signature</em>!</p>

<p>What you really want to do, is split the method into two methods. The user of <code>method_a</code> needs to know <em>anyway</em> what the different behavior between the two cases is, and he has to supply the conditional himself. Instead, he could just call the right method in the first place. So, I would split <code>method_a</code> into two:</p>

<pre><code>def method_one(params={}, &amp;block)
  method_b(params, &amp;block)
end

def method_two
  yield
end
</code></pre>

<p>And the client can decide which one to call:</p>

<pre><code>if @date &gt; Date.today then
  method_two(param1: 'value1', param2: 'value2')
else
  method_one do
    # something
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>But, if you look closely at <code>method_one</code>, you will see that all it does is just forwarding its arguments unmodified to <code>method_b</code>. So, we can just get rid of <code>method_one</code> altogether, and have the client call <code>method_b</code> directly.</p>

<p>The same goes for <code>method_two</code>: all it does is call the block. The client could have just as well run the code in the first place.</p>

<p>So, now our library code looks like this:</p>

<pre><code># there is no spoon
</code></pre>

<p>That's right! There is no library code left! (Except for <code>method_b</code> which is not part of your question.)</p>

<p>And the client code looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>if @date &gt; Date.today then
  method_b(param1: 'value1', param2: 'value2')
else
  # something
end
</code></pre>

<p>A very good example of a method that violates this rule, is <code>Module#instance_methods</code> in the Ruby core library. It tells you all the instance methods defined in a particular module and class and it takes a boolean argument which decides whether or not this list will include the methods inherited from superclasses. <em>Noone</em> can <em>ever</em> remember whether to pass <code>false</code> or <code>true</code>. <em>Noone</em>. Jim Weirich uses this example in his talks about good design and he usually asks the audience which is the inherited case and which is the immediate case. Usually, a high percentage get it wrong. Sometimes, the percentage is <em>worse than just flipping a coin</em>!</p>

<p>If you look at <a href=""http://Ruby-Doc.Org/ruby-1.9/classes/Module.html#M000919"" rel=""nofollow"">the documentation</a>, it is utterly confusing. I can <em>never</em> remember which way around the conditional goes, I <em>always</em> have to look it up in the documentation. Which isn't really that helpful, because the <em>official documentation</em>, which is part of the <em>actual</em> sourcecode of YARV and MRI, <em>has it the wrong way round, too</em>!</p>

"<p>Consider the following extension (the pattern popularized by several Rails plugins over the years):</p>

<p>If you wished to expose this to every class, you can do the following:</p>

<p>This is <em>not</em> a pattern, and it was not ""popularized"". It is an <em>anti-pattern</em> that was <em>cargo-culted</em> by 1337 PHP h4X0rZ who don't know Ruby. Thankfully, many (all?) instances of this anti-pattern have been eliminated from Rails 3, thanks to the hard word of Yehuda Katz, Carl Lerche and the others. Yehuda even uses pretty much the exact same code you posted as an anti-example both in his recent talks about cleaning up the Rails codebase, and he wrote <a href=""http://YehudaKatz.Com/2009/11/12/better-ruby-idioms/"">an entire blog post</a> just about this one anti-pattern.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you wished to expose this to every class, you can do the following:</p>

<pre><code>Object.send :include, Extension
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>If you want to add it to <code>Object</code> <em>anyway</em>, then why not just do that:</p>

<pre><code>class Object
  def instance_method
    puts ""Called instance_method within #{inspect}""
  end
end
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>But how do you add macro-like methods to all Ruby modules?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Simple: by adding them to <code>Module</code>:</p>

<pre><code>class Module
  def macro_method
    puts ""Called macro_method within #{inspect}""
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>It all just works:</p>

<pre><code>class FooClass
  macro_method
end
#=&gt; Called macro_method within FooClass

FooClass.new.instance_method
#=&gt; Called instance_method within #&lt;FooClass:0x192abe0&gt;

module FooModule
  macro_method
end
#=&gt; Called macro_method within FooModule
</code></pre>

<p>It's just 10 lines of code vs. your 16, and exactly 0 of those 10 lines are metaprogramming or hooks or anything even remotely complicated.</p>

<p>The only difference between your code and mine is that in your code, the mixins show up in the inheritance hierarchy, so it is a tad easier to debug, because you actually <em>see</em> that something was added to <code>Object</code>. But that is easily fixed:</p>

<pre><code>module ObjectExtensions
  def instance_method
    puts ""Called instance_method within #{inspect}""
  end
end

class Object
  include ObjectExtensions
end

module ModuleExtensions
  def macro_method
    puts ""Called macro_method within #{inspect}""
  end
end

class Module
  include ModuleExtensions
end
</code></pre>

<p>Now I'm tied with your code at 16 lines but I would argue that mine is simpler than yours, especially considering that yours doesn't work and neither you nor I nor almost 190000 StackOverflow users can figure out why.</p>

"<p>So I know you can say Kernel.const_get(""ClassName"") and you'll get back the class to which the string corresponds in name. But what about for variables? Is there a way to do:</p>

<pre><code>test = ""heyas""

</code></pre>

<p>Thanks so much</p>

<p>The fact is that I need it in more complex code, real example:</p>

<pre><code>class User
  class Validations
    class &lt;&lt; self
      def username_len
        return u.len &gt; 3 and u.len &lt; 22
      end
      # ...
    end
  end
  def validate(u,e,p)
    [:u, :e, :p].each do |v|
      Validations.send(:define_singleton_method, v, lambda { eval(v.to_s) }) # see this line
    end
    #other code to run validations
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>So you see, there's no better way, is there?</p>
","2988","","<p>No, there is only <code>class_variable_get</code>, <code>instance_variable_get</code> and <code>const_get</code>. There is no <code>local_variable_get</code>. But it wouldn't make sense anyway: local variables are local to the current method body, module body, class body or script body, that's why they are <em>called</em> ""local"" variables, after all! You simply <em>cannot</em> access them from another method.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is there a way to do:</p>

<pre><code>test = ""heyas""
some_method_here(""test"") #=&gt; ""heyas""
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>No, there is no way to do this. And there <em>cannot possibly be</em> a way to do it. <code>test</code> is a <em>local</em> variable, which means it <em>only</em> exists in the current script body. It <em>does not</em> exist inside the body of <code>some_method_here</code>. That's the <em>whole point</em> of local variables: you cannot ever, under any circumstances, access them from somewhere else.</p>

<p>Regarding your comment on another answer:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>def my_func(str)
  var_a = 'hey'
  var_b = 'ah'
  return some_method_here(str)
end
#=&gt; should return the corresponding variable's value, e.g. my_func('var_a')
#=&gt; 'hey'
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, this <em>cannot possibly</em> work, since the <em>whole point</em> of local variables is that they <em>cannot</em> be accessed from anywhere else.</p>

<p>But there is a pretty simple variation which does exactly what you want:</p>

<pre><code>def my_func(str)
  {
    'var_a' =&gt; 'hey',
    'var_b' =&gt; 'ah'
  }[str]
end
#=&gt; should return the corresponding variable's value, e.g. my_func('var_a')
#=&gt; 'hey'
</code></pre>

<p>This can of course be further simplified to:</p>

<pre><code>my_func = {'var_a' =&gt; 'hey', 'var_b' =&gt; 'ah'}
#=&gt; should return the corresponding variable's value, e.g. my_func['var_a']
#=&gt; 'hey'
</code></pre>

<p>Given that you can only pass in a limited number of different options, it's probably better to use symbols instead:</p>

<pre><code>my_func = {var_a: 'hey', var_b: 'ah'}
#=&gt; should return the corresponding variable's value, e.g. my_func[:var_a]
#=&gt; 'hey'
</code></pre>

<p>What you are asking is basically: pass in a key, get a value out. That's <em>exactly</em> what a <code>Hash</code> is.</p>

<p>EDIT: After the revised question, this is the best that I could come up with:</p>

<pre><code>def validate(u, e, p)
  local_variables.zip(local_variables.map {|var|
    eval(var.to_s)
  }).each {|var, val|
    Validations.send(:define_singleton_method, var) { val }
  }
end
</code></pre>

<p>However, I think there is something seriously wrong with the design. You overwrite <em>singleton methods</em> of <code>User::Validations</code> based on different <em>instances</em> of <code>User</code>. By the very definition of <em>singleton</em> method, there can only ever be one copy of those in the system. But you have many different instances of <code>User</code>, and every time you call <code>User#validate</code> it will <em>overwrite</em> the <em>only</em> copies of <code>User::Validations.u</code>, <code>User::Validations.e</code> and <code>User::Validations.p</code> at which point they will start to behave completely differently for the <em>entire</em> system.</p>

<p>In other words, you are changing the behavior of the <em>entire system</em> based on a <em>single instance</em>. And there can be <em>many instances</em> and every time, the behavior of the system changes.</p>

<p>That just <em>can't</em> be right.</p>

<pre><code>u1 = User.new
u1.validate('u1', :e1, 1)

p User::Validations.u, User::Validations.e, User::Validations.p
# =&gt; 'u1'
# =&gt; :e1
# =&gt; 1

u2 = User.new
u2.validate('U2', :E2, 2.0)
# =&gt;  warning: method redefined; discarding old u
# =&gt;  warning: method redefined; discarding old e
# =&gt;  warning: method redefined; discarding old p
#              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#                    Oops!

p User::Validations.u, User::Validations.e, User::Validations.p
# =&gt; 'U2'
# =&gt; :E2
# =&gt; 2.0
#    ^^^
# Completely different results for the exact same arguments

"<p>Let there be <code>class Example</code> defined as: </p>

<pre><code>class Example
  def initialize(test='hey')
    self.class.send(:define_method, :say_hello, lambda { test })

</code></pre>

<p>On calling <code>Example.new; Example.new</code> I get a <code>warning: method redefined; discarding old say_hello</code>. This, I conclude, must be because it defines a method in the actual class (which makes sense, from the syntax). And that, of course, would prove disastrous should there be multiple instances of <code>Example</code> with different values in their methods.</p>

<p>Is there a way to create methods just for the instance of a class from inside that instance?</p>

<p>Thanks so much.</p>
","2988","","<p>First off, a small style tip:</p>

<pre><code>self.class.send(:define_method, :say_hello, lambda { test })
</code></pre>

<p>You can make this look a little bit nicer by using the new proc literal in Ruby 1.9:</p>

<pre><code>self.class.send(:define_method, :say_hello, -&gt; { test })
</code></pre>

<p>But you don't need that. Ruby has something called <em>blocks</em>, which are basically a piece of code that you can pass as an argument to a method. In fact, you already used blocks, since <code>lambda</code> is just a method which takes a block as an argument and returns a <code>Proc</code>. However, <code>define_method</code> <em>already</em> takes a block anyway, there is no need to pass a block to <code>lambda</code> which converts it to a <code>Proc</code> which it passes to <code>define_method</code> which then converts it back into a block:</p>

<pre><code>self.class.send(:define_method, :say_hello) { test }
</code></pre>

<p>As you already noticed, you are defining the method on the wrong class. You are defining it on the <code>Example</code> class, since inside an instance method like <code>initialize</code>, <code>self</code> is the current object (i.e. <code>ex1</code> or <code>ex2</code> in @mikej's example), which means that <code>self.class</code> is <code>ex1</code>'s class, which is <code>Example</code>. So, you are overwriting the same method over and over again.</p>

<p>This leads to the following unwanted behavior:</p>

<pre><code>ex1 = Example.new('ex1')
ex2 = Example.new('ex2') # warning: method redefined; discarding old say_hello
ex1.say_hello            # =&gt; ex2 # Huh?!?
</code></pre>

<p>Instead, if you want a singleton method, you need to define it on the singleton class:</p>

<pre><code>(class &lt;&lt; self; self end).send(:define_method, :say_hello) { test }
</code></pre>

<p>This works as intended:</p>

<pre><code>ex1 = Example.new('ex1')
ex2 = Example.new('ex2')
ex1.say_hello            # =&gt; ex1
ex2.say_hello            # =&gt; ex2
</code></pre>

<p>In Ruby 1.9, there's a method that does that:</p>

<pre><code>define_singleton_method(:say_hello) { test }
</code></pre>

<p>Now, this works the way you want it to, but there's a higher-level problem here: this is not Ruby code. It is Ruby <em>syntax</em>, but it's not Ruby code, it's Scheme.</p>

<p>Now, Scheme is a <em>brilliant</em> language and writing Scheme code in Ruby syntax is certainly not a bad thing to do. It beats the hell out of writing Java or PHP code in Ruby syntax, or, as was the case in a StackOverflow question yesterday, Fortran-57 code in Ruby syntax. But it's not as good as writing <em>Ruby</em> code in Ruby syntax.</p>

<p>Scheme is a functional language. Functional languages use functions (more precisely, function closures) for encapsulation and state. But Ruby is not a functional language, it is an object-oriented language and OO languages use <em>objects</em> for encapsulation and state.</p>

<p>So, function closures become objects and captured variables become instance variables.</p>

<p>We can also come at this from a completely different angle: what you are doing is that you are defining a <em>singleton</em> method, which is a method whose purpose it is to define behavior which is specific to <em>one</em> object. But you are defining that singleton method for <em>every</em> instance of the class, and you are defining the <em>same</em> singleton method for every instance of the class. We already have a mechanism for defining behavior for every instance of a class: instance methods.</p>

<p>Both of these arguments come from completely opposite directions, but they arrive at the same destination:</p>

<pre><code>class Example
  def initialize(test='hey')
    @test = test
  end

  def say_hello
    @test
  end
end

end

logger.debug ""target url is now #{target_url}""
</code></pre>

<p>This returns target_url without http://</p>
","2988","","<p>No, this is not a bug in Ruby, this is just how shared mutable state works, not just in Ruby but in <em>any</em> programming language.</p>

<p>Think about it this way: my mom calls me ""son"", my friends call me ""Jörg"". If I cut my hair, then it doesn't matter which name you use to refer to me: I am the same person, regardless of whether you call me ""son"" or ""Jörg"" or ""Mr. Mittag"" or ""hey, douchebag"", therefore my hair will always be short. It doesn't magically grow back if you call me by a different name.</p>

<p>The same thing happens in your code: you refer to the string by two different names, but it doesn't matter which name you use; if the string changes, then it changes.</p>

<p>The solution is, of course, to not share mutable state and to not mutate shared state, like in @hurikhan77's answer.</p>

","2988","","<blockquote>
  <p>In Ruby, why does defining a class evaluate to <code>nil</code>?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It doesn't.</p>

<p>First off, in Ruby you don't define a class, you execute a class body. Secondly, executing a class body does <em>not</em> evaluate to <code>nil</code> as you claim, it evaluates to the value of the last expression inside the class body. This is perfectly consistent with executing a module body and executing a method body.</p>

<p>See, for example:</p>

<pre><code>class Foo
  'Hello'
end
# =&gt; 'Hello'
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>Same goes for defining a method: why does it evaluate to <code>nil</code>?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually, it doesn't either. Defining a method evaluates to an implementation-defined value. The reason why it evaluates to an implementation-defined value is that so far the Ruby community hasn't reached a consensus on what it should return.</p>

<p>Some argue that it should evaluate to the <code>CompiledMethod</code> object corresponding to that method. That's what Rubinius does. However, there is a problem with this: not all Ruby implementations compile their methods. And not all of them that <em>do</em> compile them, compile them at definition time. JRuby, for example, only compiles them when they are executed, more precisely <em>after</em> they have been executed 20 times. Sometimes it doesn't compile them <em>at all</em>, for example in environments where compilation is forbidden such as Google App Engine. Also, not all Ruby implementations do have a Ruby representation for their compiled methods. And even if they did, their compiled methods are vastly different: Rubinius's compiled methods are Rubinius bytecode, YARV's compiled methods are YARV bytecode, JRuby's compiled methods are JVM bytecode, IronRuby's compiled methods are DLR trees. And of course the most widely used implementation, MRI, doesn't even <em>have</em> a compiler.</p>

<p>Others say, it should evaluate to the <code>UnboundMethod</code> object corresponding to that method. Here, the problem is that there is no single <code>UnboundMethod</code> object corresponding to a method. There's infinitely many of them. Ruby methods <em>aren't</em> objects. They can be <em>converted</em> to objects, but they aren't objects themselves. And when they are converted to objects, they generate a new object every time. So, the <code>UnboundMethod</code> object that would be returned is really not directly related to the method that was defined. Also, what would you want to do with an unbound method? The only case where <em>I</em> use an unbound method is to wrap an already existing method that I cannot modify; but if I have access to the definition anyway, then I don't need to wrap it.</p>

<p>A third group says that defining a method should evaluate to its name. This seems to be a somewhat arbitrary choice. In fact, I have not seen any compelling reason for why this should be the case. Literally the only argument is that this would allow you to make Ruby look more like Java:</p>

<pre><code># here's how you make a single method private today
def foo(bar) end
private :foo

# instead you could do this:
private def foo(bar) end
</code></pre>

<p>So, basically, the reason why method definitions return an implementation-defined value (which on most implementations is just <code>nil</code>) is that nobody has come up with a better suggestion.</p>

<p>Interestingly, <code>Module#define_method</code> <em>does</em> return something useful. If you use a method to define a method, it returns the old method. If you use a proc to define a method it returns a variation of that proc. If you use a block to define a method, it returns a proc corresponding to that block. In other words, it returns an executable object that corresponds to the method body:</p>

<pre><code>class Foo
  $bar  = -&gt;{}
  $baz  = define_method :baz, $bar

  $qux  = instance_method :baz
  $quux = define_method :quux, $qux

  define_method :corge do;end
end
# =&gt; #&lt;Proc:0x1cda900@(irb):8 (lambda)&gt;

$bar.eql?   $baz  # =&gt; true
$bar.equal? $baz  # =&gt; false
$qux.equal? $quux # =&gt; true
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wouldn't it be useful if defining a class would evaluate as the class?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why? The way it is now, class bodies can return anything you want, <em>including</em> the class. With your suggestion, it could return <em>only</em> the class, so it would be strictly less powerful.</p>

<p>Also, the only case were I ever needed a class body to return the class itself, was for getting a reference to the singleton class of an object, like this:</p>

<pre><code>foo = Object.new
foo_singleton_class = class &lt;&lt; foo; self end
</code></pre>

<p>Or the more well-known pattern:</p>

<pre><code>class Object; def singleton_class; class &lt;&lt; self; self end end end
</code></pre>

<p>But now that <code>Object#singleton_class</code> is part of the core library, that is no longer necessary.</p>

","2988","","<p>It's pretty much impossible to figure out what your code does, because it doesn't actually work. Apparently, it parses some data, but you don't tell us how it parses that data, what that data is and you don't provide any example data. Also, it seems that it depends on some libraries, but you don't tell us what those libraries are. The local variable <code>docs</code> which seems to be pretty much the most important thing in your code, is not defined. And instead of showing us what the output is that you want, you only show us what the output is that you <em>don't</em> want.</p>

<p>Anyway, as far as I have been able to figure out, this seems to be what you want:</p>

<pre><code>require 'open-uri'
require 'nokogiri'

doc = Nokogiri.XML(open('http://googleblog.blogspot.com/atom.xml'))

puts doc.css('entry').reduce(Hash.new {|hsh, key| hsh[key] = [] }) {|cats, entry|
  cats.tap {|cats|
    entry.css('category').each {|cat|
      cats[cat['term']] &lt;&lt; entry.css('title').text
    }
  }
}.reduce('') {|s, (cat, titles)|
  s.tap {|s|
    s &lt;&lt; ""  For Category :    #{cat}\n""
    s &lt;&lt; titles.reduce('') {|s, title|
      s.tap {|s|

      }
    }
    s &lt;&lt; ""---------------------------------------------------\n""
  }

"<p>Two uses of version control seem to dictate different checkin styles.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>distribution centric</strong>: changesets will generally reflect a complete feature.  In general these checkins will be larger.  This style is more user/maintainer friendly.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>rollback centric</strong>: changesets will be individual small steps so the history can function like an incredibly powerful undo.  In general these checkins will be smaller.  This style is more developer friendly.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I like to use my version control as really powerful undo while while I banging away at some stubborn code/bug.  In this way I'm not afraid to make drastic changes just to try out a possible solution.  However, this seems to give me a fragmented file history with lots of ""well that didn't work"" checkins.</p>

<p>If instead I try to have my changeset reflect complete features I loose the use of my version control software for experimentation.  However, it is much easier for user/maintainers to figure out how the code is evolving.  Which has great advantages for code reviews, managing multiple branches, etc.</p>

<p>So what's a developer to do? Checkin small steps or complete features?</p>
","2988","","<p>The beauty of DVCS systems is that you can have <em>both</em>, because in a DVCS unlike a CVCS, <em>publishing</em> is orthogonal to <em>committing</em>. In a CVCS, every commit is automatically published, but it in a DVCS, commits are only published when they are <em>pushed</em>.</p>

<p>So, <em>commit</em> small steps, but only <em>publish</em> working features.</p>

<p>If you are worried about polluting your history, then you can rewrite it. You might have heard that rewriting history is evil, but that is not true: only rewriting <em>published</em> history is evil, but again, since publishing and committing are different, you can rewrite your unpublished history before publishing it.</p>

<p>This is how Linux development works, for example. Linus Torvalds is very concerned with keeping the history clean. In one of the very early e-mails about Git, he said that the published history should look not like you <em>actually</em> developed it, but how you <em>would have</em> developed it, if you were omniscient, could see into the future and never made any mistakes.</p>

<p>Now, Linux is a little bit special: it has commits going in at a rate of 1 commit every 11 minutes for 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year, including nights, weekends, holidays and natural disasters. And that rate is still increasing. Just imagine how much more commits there would be if every single typo and brainfart would result in a commit, too.</p>

<p>But the developers themselves in their private repositories commit however often they want.</p>

"<p>Which of these two forms of Array Initialization is better in Ruby?</p>

<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>

<pre><code>DAYS_IN_A_WEEK = (0..6).to_a
HOURS_IN_A_DAY = (0..23).to_a

@data = Array.new(DAYS_IN_A_WEEK.size).map!{ Array.new(HOURS_IN_A_DAY.size) }

DAYS_IN_A_WEEK.each do |day|
  HOURS_IN_A_DAY.each do |hour|
    @data[day][hour] = 'something'
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>

<pre><code>DAYS_IN_A_WEEK = (0..6).to_a
HOURS_IN_A_DAY = (0..23).to_a

  HOURS_IN_A_DAY.each do |hour|

    @data[day][hour] = 'something'

<p>The difference between the first method and the second method is that the second one does not allocate memory initially. I feel the second one is a bit inferior when it comes to performance due to the numerous amount of Array copies that has to happen.</p>

<p>However, it is not straight forward in Ruby to find what is happening. So, if someone can explain me which is better, it would be really great!</p>

","2988","","<p>What's wrong with just</p>

<pre><code>@data = Array.new(7) { Array.new(24) { 'something' }}
</code></pre>

<p>Or, if you are content having the <em>same</em> object everywhere:</p>

<pre><code>@data = Array.new(7) { Array.new(24, 'something') }
</code></pre>

<p>It's much faster, not that it would matter. It is also <em>much more</em> readable, which is the most important thing. After all, the purpose of code is communicating intent to the other stakeholders, <em>not</em> communicating with the computer.<pre>             user   system     total       real
method1  8.969000 0.000000  8.969000 ( 9.059570)

method3  6.468000 0.000000  6.468000 ( 6.616211)
method4  0.969000 0.015000  0.984000 ( 1.021484)</pre>That last line also shows another interesting thing: the runtime is dominated by the time needed to create the 7*24*100000 = 16.8 million <code>'something'</code> strings.</p>

<p>And of course there is another important obversation: your <code>method1</code> and <code>method2</code> that you are comparing against each other do two completely different things! It doesn't even make sense to compare them against each other. <code>method1</code> creates an <code>Array</code>, <code>method2</code> creates a <code>Hash</code>.</p>

<p>Your <code>method1</code> is equivalent to my first example above:</p>

<pre><code>@data = Array.new(7) { Array.new(24) { 'something' }}
</code></pre>

<p>While <code>method2</code> is (<em>very</em> roughly) equivalent to:</p>

<pre><code>@data = Hash.new {|h, k| h[k] = Hash.new {|h, k| h[k] = 'something' }}
</code></pre>

<p>Well, except that <em>your</em> <code>method2</code> initializes the entire <code>Hash</code> eagerly, while my method only executes the initialization code lazily in case an uninitialized key is read.</p>

<p>In other words, after running the above initialization code, the <code>Hash</code> is still empty:</p>

<pre><code>@data # =&gt; {}
</code></pre>

<p>But whenever you try to access a key, it will magically appear:</p>

<pre><code>@data[5][17] # =&gt; 'something'
</code></pre>

<p>And it will stay there:</p>

<pre><code>@data # =&gt; {5 =&gt; {17 =&gt; 'something'}}
</code></pre>

<p>Since this code doesn't actually initialize the <code>Hash</code>, it is obviously way faster:<pre>             user   system     total       real

# read inputs as ints
h = ARGF.drop(1).reduce(Hash.new(0)) {|h, n| h.tap {|h| h[n.to_i] += 1 }}
</code></pre>

<p>Not much to say here. Instead of simply looping over <code>ARGF</code> and setting the hash keys, we use <code>reduce</code> to let it do the work for us. And we use a hash with a default value of <code>0</code> instead of manually checking the keys for existence.</p>

<p>We use <code>Enumerable#drop</code> to simply drop the first line.</p>

<p><code>ARGF</code> is a really cool feature stolen (like most of the scripting features) from Perl: if you simply call the script as <code>script.rb</code> without arguments, then <code>ARGF</code> is the standard input. If, however, you call your script like <code>script.rb a.txt b.txt</code>, then Ruby will interpret all the arguments as filenames, open all the files for reading and <code>ARGF</code> will be the concatenation of their contents. This allows you to very quickly write scripts that can take their input either via standard input or a file.</p>

<pre><code># find smallest mode
modes = h.group_by(&amp;:last).sort.last.last.map(&amp;:first).sort
puts ""Mode is: #{modes.first}""
</code></pre>

<p>Ruby doesn't have an explicit key-value-pair type, instead most looping operations on hashes use two-element arrays. This allows us to refer to the key and the value with <code>Array#first</code> and <code>Array#last</code>.</p>

<p>In this particular case, we are using <code>Enumerable#group_by</code> to group the hash into different buckets, and the grouping criterion we use is the <code>last</code> method, i.e. the value which in our hash is the frequency. In other words, we group by frequency.</p>

<p>If we now sort the resulting hash, the very last element is the one with the highest frequency (i.e. the mode). We take the last element (the value of the key-value-pair) of that, and then the last element of that, which is an array of key-value-pairs (<code>number =&gt; frequency</code>) of which we extract the keys (the numbers) and sort them.</p>

<p>[Note: simply print out the results at every intermediate stage and it's much easier to understand. Just replace the <code>modes = ...</code> line above with something like this:</p>

<pre><code>p modes = h.tap(&amp;method(:p)).
  group_by(&amp;:last).tap(&amp;method(:p)).
  sort.tap(&amp;method(:p)).
  last.tap(&amp;method(:p)).
  last.tap(&amp;method(:p)).
  map(&amp;:first).tap(&amp;method(:p)).
  sort
</code></pre>

<p>]</p>

<p><code>modes</code> is now a sorted array with all the numbers which have that particular frequency. If we take the first element, we have the smallest mode.</p>

<pre><code># mode unique?
puts ""Mode is #{unless modes.size == 1 then '*not* ' end}unique.""
</code></pre>

<p>And if the size of the array is not <code>1</code>, then the mode was not unique.</p>

<pre><code># print number of singleton odds, 
#       odd elems repeated odd number times in desc order
#       even singletons in desc order
odds, evens = h.select {|_,f|f==1}.map(&amp;:first).sort.reverse.partition(&amp;:odd?)
</code></pre>

<p>It looks like there is a lot going on here, but it's actually straightforward. You start reading after the equals sign and simply read left to right.</p>

<ol>
<li>we select all items in the hash whose value (i.e. frequency) is <code>1</code>. IOW, we select all the singletons.</li>
<li>we map all the resulting key-value-pairs just to their first element, i.e. the number&nbsp;&ndash; IOW we throw away the frequency.</li>
<li>we sort the list</li>
<li>and then reverse it (for larger lists we should sort in reverse to begin with, since this is quite a waste of CPU cycles and memory)</li>
<li>lastly, we partition the array into two arrays, one containing all the odd numbers and the other all the even numbers</li>
<li><p>now we finally look to the left side of the equals sign: <code>Enumerable#partition</code> returns a two-element array containing the two arrays with the partitioned elements and we use Ruby's destructuring assignment to assign the two arrays to two variables</p>

<p>puts ""Number of elements with an odd value that appear only once: #{odds.size}""</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Now that we have a list of odd singletons, their number is simply the size of the list.</p>

<pre><code>puts ""Elements repeated an odd number of times: #{
  h.select {|_, f| f.odd?}.map(&amp;:first).sort.reverse.join(', ')
}""
</code></pre>

<p>This is very similar to the above: select all numbers with an odd frequency, map out the keys (i.e. numbers), sort, reverse and then convert them to a string by joining them together with a comma and space in between.</p>

<pre><code>puts ""Elements with an even value that appear exactly once: #{evens.join(', ')}""
</code></pre>

<p>Again, now that we have a list of even singletons, printing them is just a matter of joining the list elements with commas.</p>

<pre><code># print fib numbers in the hash
</code></pre>

<p>I didn't feel like refactoring this algorithm to be more efficient and specifically to memoize. I just made some small adjustments.</p>

<pre><code>class Integer
</code></pre>

<p>There was nothing in the algorithm that depended on the number being a certain size, so I pulled the method up into the <code>Integer</code> class.</p>

<pre><code>  def fib?
</code></pre>

<p>And I dropped the <code>is_</code> prefix. The fact that this is a boolean method is already explicit in the question mark.</p>

<pre><code>    l, h = 0, 1
    while h &lt;= self
      return true if h == self
      l, h = h, l+h
    end
  end
end
puts ""Fibonacci numbers: #{h.keys.sort.select(&amp;:fib?).join(', ')}""
</code></pre>

<p>This probably doesn't need much explanation: take the keys, sort them, select all Fibonacci numbers and join them together with commas.</p>

<p>Here is an idea for how to refactor this algorithm. There is <a href=""http://Neeraj.Name/2008/05/10/how-hash-works-with-block-in-ruby.html"" rel=""nofollow"">a very interesting implementation of Fibonacci</a> using a <code>Hash</code> with default values for memoizing:</p>

  fibs.default_proc = -&gt;(fibs, n) { fibs[n] = fibs[n-1] + fibs[n-2] }
end
</code></pre>

<p>It would look a little like this:</p>

<pre><code>class Integer
  @@fibs = {0 =&gt; 0, 1 =&gt; 1}.tap do |fibs|

<p>For example, <code>print {:a =&gt; :b, :c =&gt; :d}.flatten('=','&amp;')</code> should print <code>a=b&amp;c=d</code></p>

<p>I wrote some code to do this, but I was wondering if there was a neater way:</p>

<pre><code>class Hash
  def flatten(keyvaldelimiter, entrydelimiter)
    string = """"
    self.each do
      |key, value|
      key = ""#{entrydelimiter}#{key}"" if string != """" #nasty hack
      string += ""#{key}#{keyvaldelimiter}#{value}""  
    end
    return string
  end
end

print {:a =&gt; :b, :c =&gt; :d}.flatten('=','&amp;') #=&gt; 'c=d&amp;a=b'

","2988","","<p>Slight variation of @elektronaut's version:</p>

<p>You can actually put just an <code>|e|</code> there instead of <code>|k, v|</code> in which case <code>e</code> is an array of two elements and you can call <code>e.join('=')</code>. Altogether you have something like</p>

<pre><code>class Hash
  def join(keyvaldelim=$,, entrydelim=$,) # $, is the global default delimiter
    map {|e| e.join(keyvaldelim) }.join(entrydelim)
  end
end

{a: 100, b: 200}.join('=', '&amp;') # I love showing off the new Ruby 1.9 Hash syntax

","2988","","<p>IBM cannot even <em>start</em> development until the Java Community Process has published the Java 7 specification.

<p>How should i understand the construction, like</p>

<pre><code>from ""Some text for this field""
</code></pre>

<p>Is it an assignment the value to a variable, called ""from"" ?</p>
","2988","","<p>It's not an assignment. In Ruby, assignments are done using the assignment operator <code>=</code> like this:</p>

<pre><code>var = val
</code></pre>

<p>You are probably thinking of some Lisp dialects where assignment looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>(def var val)
</code></pre>

<p>It's just a simple receiverless message send.</p>

<p>In Ruby, the general syntax for a message send is</p>

<pre><code>receiver.selector(argument1, argument2)
</code></pre>

<p>However, if the <code>receiver</code> is <code>self</code>, you can leave off the <code>receiver</code>, so</p>

<pre><code>selector(argument1, argument2)
</code></pre>

<p>is the same as</p>

<pre><code>self.selector(argument1, argument2)
</code></pre>

<p>[Note: this is not quite true. In Ruby, private methods can only be invoked via a receiverless message send, so if in this example <code>self</code> responds to the <code>selector</code> message by invoking a private method, only the first variant will work, the second will raise a <code>NoMethodError</code> exception.]</p>

<p>Also, in cases where there are no ambiguities, you can leave off the parentheses around the arguments like this:</p>

<pre><code>receiver.selector argument1, argument2
</code></pre>

<p>If you put the two things together, you can now see that</p>

<pre><code>selector argument1, argument2
</code></pre>

<p>is equivalent to</p>

<pre><code>self.selector(argument1, argument2)
</code></pre>

<p>and thus</p>

<pre><code>from ""Some text for this field""
</code></pre>

<p>is equivalent to</p>

<pre><code>self.from(""Some text for this field"")
</code></pre>

<p>There is a third shortcut in Ruby's message sending syntax: if the very last argument to a message send is a <code>Hash</code> literal, then you can leave out the curly braces. So, the last line in the above example could also be written as</p>

<pre><code>  body          :user =&gt; user, :url =&gt; ""http://example.com/login""
</code></pre>

<p>Also, in Ruby 1.9, a <code>Hash</code> literal where all keys are <code>Symbol</code>s can be written using an alternative <code>Hash</code> literal syntax:</p>

<pre><code> { key1: val1, key2: val2 }
</code></pre>

<p>is the same as the old syntax</p>

<pre><code>{ :key1 =&gt; val1, :key2 =&gt; val2 }
</code></pre>

<p>which means that, at least in Ruby 1.9, that last line could also be written as </p>

<pre><code>  body          user: user, url: ""http://example.com/login""

<p><strong>Thanks!</strong></p>
","2988","","<p>I sometimes, although <em>very</em> rarely do self-modifying code in Ruby.</p>

<p>Sometimes you have a method where you don't really know whether the data you are using (e.g. some lazy cache) is properly initialized or not. So, you have to check at the beginning of your method whether the data is properly initialized and then maybe initialize it. But you really only have to do that initialization once, but you check for it every single time.</p>

<p>So, sometimes I write a method which does the initialization and then replaces itself with a version that doesn't include the initialization code.</p>

<pre><code>class Cache
  def [](key)
    @backing_store ||= self.expensive_initialization

    def [](key)
      @backing_store[key]
    end

    @backing_store[key]
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>But honestly, I don't think that's worth it. In fact, I'm embarrassed to admit that I have never actually benchmarked to see whether that <em>one</em> conditional actually makes any difference. (On a modern Ruby implementation with an aggressively optimizing profile-feedback-driven JIT compiler probably not.)</p>

<p>Note that, depending on how you <em>define</em> ""self-modifying code"", this may or may not be what you want. You <em>are</em> replacing some part of the <em>currently</em> executing program, so &hellip;</p>

<p>EDIT: Now that I think about it, that optimization doesn't make much sense. The expensive initialization is only executed once anyway. The only thing that modification avoids, is the conditional. It would be better to take an example where the check <em>itself</em> is expensive, but I can't think of one.</p>

<p>However, I thought of a cool example of self-modifying code: the <a href=""http://Labs.Oracle.Com/projects/maxine/"" rel=""nofollow"">Maxine JVM</a>. Maxine is a Research VM (it's technically not actually <em>allowed</em> to be called a ""JVM"" because its developers don't run the compatibility testsuites) written completely in Java. Now, there are plenty of JVMs written in itself, but Maxine is the only one I know of that also <em>runs</em> in itself. This is extremely powerful. For example, the JIT compiler can JIT compile itself to adapt it to the type of code that it is JIT compiling.</p>

<p>A very similar thing happens in the <a href=""http://KleinVM.SourceForge.Net/"" rel=""nofollow"">Klein VM</a> which is a VM for the Self Programming Language.</p>

<p>In both cases, the VM can optimize and recompile <em>itself</em> at runtime.</p>

"<p>I'm new to programming, so what is the difference between a Framework, a Toolkit and a Library?</p>
","2988","","<p>The most important difference, and in fact the <em>defining</em> difference between a library and a framework is <a href=""http://MartinFowler.Com/bliki/InversionOfControl.html"">Inversion of Control</a>.</p>

<p>What does this mean? Well, it means that when you call a library, <em>you</em> are in control. But with a framework, the control is inverted: the <em>framework</em> calls you. (This is called the Hollywood Principle: Don't call Us, We'll call You.) This is pretty much the definition of a framework. If it doesn't have Inversion of Control, it's not a framework. (I'm looking at you, .NET!)</p>

<p>Basically, all the control flow is already in the framework, and there's just a bunch of predefined white spots that you can fill out with your code.</p>

<p>A library on the other hand is a collection of functionality that <em>you</em> can call.</p>

<p>I don't know if the term toolkit is really well defined. Just the word ""kit"" seems to suggest some kind of modularity, i.e. a set of independent libraries that you can pick and choose from. What, then, makes a toolkit different from just a bunch of independent libraries? Integration: if you just have a bunch of independent libraries, there is no guarantee that they will work well together, whereas the libraries in a toolkit have been designed to work well together &ndash; you just don't have to use <em>all</em> of them.</p>

<p>But that's really just my interpretation of the term. Unlike library and framework, which <em>are</em> well-defined, I don't think that there <em>is</em> a widely accepted definition of <em>toolkit</em>.</p>

","2988","","<p>The closest would probably be <a href=""http://DBus.FreeDesktop.Org/"">D-Bus</a>. D-Bus is a lightweight IPC protocol and Object Request Broker (ORB) very similar to COM and heavily inspired by both COM and D-Bus's predecessors <a href=""http://Developer.KDE.Org/documentation/other/dcop.html"">DCOP</a> (KDE) and <a href=""http://Library.GNOME.Org/devel/platform-overview/stable/bonobo-corba"">CORBA</a> (GNOME) as well as <a href=""http://IETF.Org/rfc/rfc3549"">Netlink</a> (Linux Kernel).</p>

<p>Before D-Bus, both major Unix desktop environments had their own component models and desktop busses. GNOME had Bonobo which was based on CORBA and KDE had KParts which was based on DCOP. And the Linux Kernel has Netlink which is a communication protocol between kernel and userspace which is used for example by the <code>iproute2</code> tool whenever you configure a networking interface.</p>

<p>The kernel developers constantly got requests to release Netlink as a separate part for communication between userspace programs, however they feared that this would lead to feature bloat and maintenance problems. In the end, under the umbrella of the Free Desktop organization whose goal it is to create cros-desktop standards, both the KDE and GNOME developers got together to develop an IPC messaging system based on the best parts of DCOP and Netlink, and the result was D-Bus.</p>

<p>In current versions of both GNOME and KDE, D-Bus has completely replaced CORBA and DCOP, thus making it possible to run GNOME applications in KDE and vice-versa with much higher fidelity. D-Bus has also been picked up by many other desktop environments and applications, not only on Linux but other Unix systems, as well as OSX and even Windows.</p>

<p>An alternative that should at least be mentioned is Mozilla's <a href=""https://Developer.Mozilla.Org/en/XPCOM/"">XPCOM</a>, which is a cross-platform object model heavily inspired by CORBA and COM. (In fact, XPCOM is an acronym for Cross-Platform Component Object Model.) It uses an IDL very similar to CORBA called XPIDL. However, as far as I know, nobody actually uses XPCOM, it is recognized both by critics as well as developers of Firefox and other Mozilla applications as one major source of bloat, and the Mozila developers are in fact actively working on reducing the usage of XPCOM especially <em>inside</em> components like Gecko.</p>

<p>However, as @Daniel Pryden points out, there's a lot of stuff <em>already</em> in Unix that should be preferred over D-Bus in cases where tight integration with a desktop is not needed. I am talking about stuff like pipes, named pipes and sockets.</p>

"<p>At about the 19:00 mark in <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iKYRKtAsA#t=19m0s"">his RailsConf presentation</a>, David Heinemeier Hansson talks about the downsides of <code>instance_eval</code>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For a long time I ranted and raved
  against <code>instance_eval</code>, which is the
  concept of not using a yielded
  parameter (like <code>do |people|</code>) and
  just straight <code>do something</code> and then
  evaluate what's in that block within
  the scope of where you came from (I
  don't even know if that's a coherent
  explanation)</p>
  
  <p>For a long time I didn't like that
  because it felt more complex in some
  sense. If you wanted to put your own
  code in there were you going to
  trigger something that was already
  there? Were you going to override
  something? When you're yielding a
  specific variable you can chain
  everything off that and you can know
  [you're] not messing with anybody
  else's stuff</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This sounded interesting, but a) I don't know how how <code>instance_eval</code> works in the first place and b) I don't understand why it can be bad / increase complexity.</p>

<p>Can someone explain?</p>
","2988","","<p>The thing that <code>instance_eval</code> does is that it runs the block in the context of a different instance. In other words, it changes the meaning of <code>self</code> which means it changes the meaning of instance methods and instance variables.</p>

<p>This creates a cognitive disconnect: the context in which the block runs is not the context in which it appears on the screen.</p>

<p>Let me demonstrate that with a slight variation of @Matt Briggs's example. Let's say we're not building a form, we're building an e-mail:</p>

<pre><code>mail do |f|
  f.subject @subject
  f.name    name
end
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, <code>@subject</code> is an instance variable of <em>your</em> object and <code>name</code> is a method of <em>your</em> class. You can use nice object-oriented decomposition and store your subject in a variable.</p>

<pre><code>mail do 
  subject @subject
  name    name # Huh?!?
end
</code></pre>

<p>In <em>this</em> case, <code>@subject</code> is an instance variable of the <em>mail builder</em> object! It might not even <em>exist</em>! (Or even worse, it <em>might</em> exist and contain some completely stupid value.) There is <em>no way</em> for you to get access to <em>your</em> object's instance variables. And how do you even <em>call</em> the <code>name</code> method of your object? Everytime you try to call it, you get the <em>mail builder's</em> method.</p>

<p>Basically, <code>instance_eval</code> makes it hard to use your own code inside the DSL code. So, it should really only be used in cases where there is very little chance that this might be needed.</p>

"<p>I have been reading documentation describing class inheritance, abstract base classes and even python interfaces. But nothing seams to be exactly what I want. Namely, a simple way of building virtual classes. When the virtual class gets called, I would like it to instantiate some more specific class based on what the parameters it is given and hand that back the calling function. For now I have a summary way of rerouting calls to the virtual class down to the underlying class.</p>

<p>The idea is the following:</p>

<pre><code>class Shape:
    def __init__(self, description):
        if   description == ""It's flat"":  self.underlying_class = Line(description)
        elif description == ""It's spiky"": self.underlying_class = Triangle(description)
        elif description == ""It's big"":   self.underlying_class = Rectangle(description)
    def number_of_edges(self, parameters):
        return self.underlying_class(parameters)

class Line:
    def __init__(self, description):
        self.desc = description
    def number_of_edges(self, parameters):
        return 1

class Triangle:
    def __init__(self, description):
        self.desc = description
    def number_of_edges(self, parameters):
        return 3

class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, description):
        self.desc = description
    def number_of_edges(self, parameters):
        return 4

shape_dont_know_what_it_is = Shape(""It's big"")
shape_dont_know_what_it_is.number_of_edges(parameters)
</code></pre>

<p>My rerouting is far from optimal, as only calls to the number_of_edges() function get passed on. Adding something like this to Shape doesn't seam to do the trick either:</p>

    return underlying_class.__getattr__(*args)

"<p>I've played around with IronRuby lately, but I would like to install the reference implementation also. Needless to say, I'm a noob when it comes to Ruby, so I have a very stupid question.</p>

<p>On the <a href=""http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=167&amp;release_id=43805"" rel=""nofollow"">RubyForge download page</a>, there are three different <strong>final</strong> versions of the Ruby installer (for Windows):</p>

<p>I'm confused...</p>
","2988","","<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>There aren't three different final releases, there is only one: ""final"" in this case means the version of the <em>installer</em>, not the <em>interpreter</em>. There is only one installer for all three versions of both interpreters.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I can understand that there is one 1.8 release, and one 1.9 release, but why can I choose between 1.8.6 and 1.8.7?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In Ruby, a change in minor number indicates significant backwards-incompatibility and/or major new language features. The 1.8&rarr;1.9 transition has both incompatibilities and new features. While Ruby 1.9 is the current version, there is still a lot of code out there, that hasn't been updated to Ruby 1.9 yet. Also, a lot of operating systems don't yet ship Ruby 1.9 as default, and some don't ship Ruby 1.9 at all.</p>

<p>That's why there is both 1.9 and 1.8.</p>

<p>Why two versions of 1.8? Well, 1.8.7 is this strange netherversion. 1.8.7 got a massive backport of features from 1.9 in order to ease the transition. However, for a long time, 1.8.7 didn't get a lot of acceptance and 1.8.6 is still the recommended version by the Rails team. (This will change with Rails 3 which requires 1.8.7 or the not yet released 1.9.2.)</p>

<p>Ruby 1.8.6 is still the default (and in fact only) version on a lot of the more slowly moving Linux distributions which offer 3-year or 5-years support contracts. Ruby 1.8.6 was also the latest version of the OneClick Installer which was the predecessor of the RubyInstaller. If the RubyInstaller is to be a replacement for the OneClick Installer, it has to offer the same version. And last but not least, there is simply a <em>ton</em> of code out there that was tested and validated on 1.8.6.</p>

<p>Also, Ruby 1.8.6 was the version implemented by JRuby 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 and 1.4. Only the recently released JRuby 1.5 upgraded to 1.8.7. JRuby 1.6 will implement both 1.8.7 and 1.9.2. Also, IronRuby 1.0 implements Ruby 1.8.6.</p>

<p>In other words: the RubyInstaller for MRI 1.8.6 is still there for the same reason that Microsoft still supports Windows XP, after having tried to kill it off twice: there's people using it who would get really upset if they didn't.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What I really would like to know is what version is the ""best one"" ? If the answer is ""1.9.1"", why would one choose 1.8.6 or 1.8.7 ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Personally, I think the ""best one"" is Ruby 1.9.<strong>2</strong>, which hasn't been released yet.</p>

<p>Here's my personal breakdown:</p>

<ul>
<li>if you are just starting with Ruby and play around with it, 1.9.2 is the best version: Ruby 1.9 is the latest version of the language and 1.9.2 is considered to be the feature-complete version of the 1.9 branch; it fixes some oversights and annoyances in 1.9.1 and adds some nice features. Also, most Ruby implementations do not implement 1.9.1, IronRuby will go straight from 1.8.6 to 1.9.2, JRuby will implement both 1.8.7 and 1.9.2 and Rubinius will also go to 1.9.2.</li>
<li>if you actually want to deploy and/or distribute Ruby applications, 1.9.1 and 1.8.7 are the best versions, simply because 1.9.2 hasn't been officially released yet: use 1.9.1 if you can get away with it (i.e. if the third-party libraries you depend on support it), otherwise 1.8.7.</li>
<li>if you have a large legacy codebase, use 1.8.6. (Actually, if you have large legacy codebase, update it to 1.9.2 &hellip;)</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that you have to be very careful to distinguish between the version of the <em>language</em>, the <em>implementation</em>, the version of the implementation and the version of the <em>installer</em>.</p>

<p>For example, the first in your list is version 1.8.6 of the <em>language</em>, the MRI interpreter, version 1.8.6-p398 of MRI and version ""Final"" of the installer. The third in you list is version 1.9.1 of the language, the <em>YARV</em> compiler/VM (i.e. a <em>different</em> implementation from the other two), version 1.9.1-p378 of YARV and also version ""Final"" of the installer.</p>

<p>Version 1.0 of IronRuby implements version 1.8.6 of Ruby, Version 1.5 of JRuby implements both version 1.8.7 and (a subset of) 1.9.2 of Ruby, selectable by a commandline switch.</p>

","2988","","<p>Here's a quick tip that is not directly related to your question: in Ruby, there is no such thing as an <code>if</code> statement. In fact, in Ruby, there are no statements <em>at all</em>. <em>Everything</em> is an expression. An <code>if</code> expression returns the value of the last expression that was evaluated in the branch that was taken.</p>

<p>So, there is no need to write</p>

<pre><code>if condition
  foo(something)
else
  foo(something_else)

<p>This would better be written as</p>

<pre><code>foo(

</code></pre>

<p>Note: Ruby also has a ternary operator (<code>condition ? then_branch : else_branch</code>) but that is completely unnecessary and should be avoided. The only reason why the ternary operator is needed in languages like C is because in C <code>if</code> is a statement and thus cannot return a value. You need the ternary operator, because it is an expression and is the only way to return a value from a conditional. But in Ruby, <code>if</code> is already an expression, so there is really no need for a ternary operator.</p>

There are some implementations (e.g. CPython, MRI, YARV) which cannot actually run threads in parallel, but that's a limitation of those specific implementations, not the language. This is similar to Java, where there are also some implementations which cannot run threads in parallel, but that doesn't mean that Java is single-threaded.</p>

<p>Note that in both cases there are lots of implementations which <em>can</em> run threads in parallel: PyPy, IronPython, Jython, IronRuby and JRuby are only few of the examples.</p>

<p>The main difference between Clojure on the one side and Python, Ruby, Java, C#, C++, C, PHP and pretty much every other mainstream and not-so-mainstream language on the other side is that Clojure has a <em>sane</em> concurrency model. All the other languages use threads, which we have known to be a bad concurrency model for at least 40 years. Clojure OTOH has a sane update model which allows it to not only present one but actually multiple sane concurrency models to the programmer: atomic updates, software transactional memory, asynchronous agents, concurrency-aware thread-local global variables, futures, promises, dataflow concurrency and in the future possibly even more.</p>

Follows the result of both functions.</p>

<p>As with all my code snippets on StackOverflow, I always assume the latest version of Ruby. Here's one that also works with Ruby 1.8:</p>

<pre><code>require 'iconv'
require 'digest/sha2'

</code></pre>

<p>Note that in this case, you have to <em>know</em> and tell Ruby about the encoding the string is in explicitly. In Ruby 1.9, Ruby always knows what encoding a string is in, and will convert it accordingly, when required. I chose UTF-8 as default encoding because it is backwards-compatible with ASCII, is the standard encoding on the internet and also otherwise widely used. However, for example both .NET and Java use UTF-16LE, not UTF-8. If your string is not UTF-8 or ASCII-encoded, you will have to pass in the encoding name into the <code>sha512</code> method.</p>

<hr>

<p>Off-Topic: 9 lines of code reduced to 1. I love Ruby!</p>

<p>Well, actually that is a little bit unfair. You could have written it something like this:</p>

<pre><code>var messageBytes = new UnicodeEncoding().GetBytes(str);
var hashValue = new System.Security.Cryptography.SHA512Managed().
    ComputeHash(messageBytes);
return hashValue.Aggregate&lt;byte, string&gt;("""",
    (s, b) =&gt; s += string.Format(""{0:x2}"", b)
);
</code></pre>

<p>Which is really only 3 lines (broken into 5 for StackOverflow's layout) and most importantly gets rid of that ugly 1950s-style explicit <code>for</code> loop for a nice 1960s-style fold (aka. <code>reduce</code> aka. <code>inject</code> aka. <code>Aggregate</code> aka. <code>inject:into:</code> &hellip; it's all the same).</p>

"<p>I think there is a shorter way of writing this <code>foreach</code> loop that creates a deep copy of a <code>SortedDictionary&lt;string, object&gt;</code>.  Note that <code>object</code> is just a place holder, I'm really using some other reference type there.  Thanks!</p>

<p>Here is the code:</p>

<pre><code>foreach (KeyValuePair&lt;string, object&gt; entry in sortedDictionary)
{
    this.mSortedDictionary.Add(entry.Key, new object());
}
</code></pre>
","2988","","<p>One of the rules of thumb of programming: in every other loop, there is a catamorphism (also called <code>fold</code>, <code>reduce</code>, <code>inject:into:</code> or <code>inject</code>) waiting to get out. This is also the case here. Thankfully, one of the LINQ operators provides a catamorphism for us, which Microsoft calls <code>Aggregate</code>:</p>

<pre><code>sortedDictionary.Aggregate(mSortedDictionary, (d, e) =&gt; {
    d.Add(e.Key, Transform(e.Value)); return d; });
</code></pre>

<p>Note: this could be further simplified by using the K combinator and a destructuring bind. Unfortunately, I couldn't find the K combinator in the BCL, although I'm pretty sure it <em>has</em> to be there somewhere. (If anybody knows, please tell me.)</p>

<p>For the purpose of this example, I'm going to provide my own K combinator and I'm going to call it <code>Tap</code> for no other reason than that's what it's called in Ruby:</p>

<pre><code>public static T Tap&lt;T&gt;(this T o, Action&lt;T&gt; f) { f(o); return o; }
</code></pre>

<p>That's literally all there is to it. (Well, at least if you ignore thread-safety and exceptions &hellip;)</p>

<p>Using the K combinator, we arrive at this:</p>

<pre><code>sortedDictionary.Aggregate(mSortedDictionary, (d, e) =&gt; d.Tap(dd =&gt;
    dd.Add(e.Key, Transform(e.Value))));
</code></pre>

<p>Which is much easier on the eye.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we cannot add destructuring bind ourselves, but if C# <em>did</em> support destructuring bind, it would look more like this:</p>

<pre><code>sortedDictionary.Aggregate(mSortedDictionary, (d, {k, v}) =&gt; d.Tap(dd =&gt;
    dd.Add(k, Transform(v))));
</code></pre>

<p>[Note: in this example, I use object initializer syntax for destructuring bind.]</p>

<p>For example, in Ruby, which <em>does</em> have both destructuring bind and the K combinator, it would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>sorted_dictionary.reduce(m_sorted_dictionary) {|d, (k, v)|
  d.tap {|d| d[k] = transform(v) }
}

<p>I'd probably go for the latter: hosting the DLR is absolutely easy and it gives you access to not only one but several good scripting languages (at the moment Ruby, Python, ECMAScript and Scheme) and in fact the user can use <em>any</em> DLR language they have installed on their machine.</p>

","2988","","<h2><a href=""http://Ioke.Org/"" rel=""nofollow"">Ioke</a></h2>

<p>Ioke allows overriding of literals, but not the definition of new ones. The way this works is that literals simply get translated into message sends and then you can override the corresponding methods just like any other.</p>

<p>For example, this the ""literal syntax"" for a <code>Dict</code> with two entries, one mapping a <code>Symbol</code> to a <code>Text</code>, the other mapping a <code>Symbol</code> to a <code>Number</code>:</p>

<pre><code>{ :name =&gt; ""Jörg"", :age =&gt; 31 }
</code></pre>

<p>This actually gets translated into a message send, for a message named <code>{}</code> (BTW: lists work the same way, their corresponding message is <code>[]</code>). It is exactly equivalent (and can be written like this if you want) to:</p>

<pre><code>{}(:name =&gt; ""Jörg"", :age =&gt; 31)
</code></pre>

<p>Now, <code>=&gt;</code> is actually just an operator which is defined for almost all objects and which simply returns a <code>Pair</code> with the key (the first element) being the receiver and the value being the argument. Now, operators are <em>also</em> just message sends, so this is equivalent to:</p>

<pre><code>{}(:name =&gt;(""Jörg""), :age =&gt;(31))
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>:</code> sigil which denotes a literal symbol gets translated into a message send, too:</p>

<pre><code>{}(:(""name"") =&gt;(""Jörg""), :(""age"") =&gt;(31))
</code></pre>

<p>The text literal gets translated into sending the <code>internal:createText</code> message:</p>

<pre><code>{}(:(""name"") =&gt;(internal:createText(""Jörg"")), :(""age"") =&gt;(31))
</code></pre>

<p>[Note: obviously, the way it is written here will lead to an infinite recursion. The truth is that the argument to <code>internal:createText</code> is obviously not an Ioke <code>Text</code> but rather a platform string. I.e. for <code>ikj</code>, the JVM implementation of Ioke, it is actually a <code>java.lang.String</code> and for <code>ikc</code>, the CIL implementation, it is a <code>System.String</code>. I've expressed this here using triple quotes.]</p>

<pre><code>{}(:(""name"") =&gt;(internal:createText(""""""Jörg"""""")), :(""age"") =&gt;(31))
</code></pre>

<p>This just leaves us with the number, which, you guessed it, is also a message send:</p>

<pre><code>{}(:(""name"") =&gt;(internal:createText(""""""Jörg"""""")),
   :(""age"") =&gt;(internal:createNumber(""""""31"""""")))
</code></pre>

<p>Since everything is a message send, this allows you to customize the behavior of literals at will, just by implementing the corresponding methods. Here's a short transcript from <code>iik</code>, the interactive Ioke REPL:</p>

<pre><code>iik&gt; ""Hello""
+&gt; ""Hello""

iik&gt; internal:createText = method(raw, super(raw) upper)

iik&gt; ""Hello""
+&gt; ""HELLO""

<h2><a href=""http://ConvergePL.Org/"" rel=""nofollow"">Converge</a></h2>

<p>Converge allows for powerful compile time metaprogramming, including a feature called <em>DSL Blocks</em>. A DSL block is a block of code which does not use the Converge syntax. A DSL block looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>$&lt;&lt;xml&gt;&gt;:
    &lt;xml&gt;
      &lt;literal&gt;here&lt;/literal&gt;
    &lt;/xml&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The way this works is that the string in between the <code>$&lt;&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;&gt;</code> is the name of a function which gets called <em>at compile time</em> and gets passed the entire DSL block as a string (as well as some source code metadata such as line number, file name etc.) and returns a fragment of the Converge Abstract Syntax Tree. So, in this particular case, there would be a function like this:</p>

<p>[Quick intro to Factor: <code>:</code> defines a new word, i.e. the first line defines a word named <code>feed&gt;xml</code> which takes one argument and produces one result. The first three lines of the word extract the title, the URI and the entries out of the feed object and place them on the stack. The <code>&lt;XML</code> is the parsing word which turns on XML mode and <code>XML&gt;</code> turns it off again. Inside the XML code, <code>&lt;-&gt;</code> takes a value from the stack and inserts it into the XML.]</p>

<p><a href=""http://Dorophone.BlogSpot.Com/2008/03/common-lisp-reader-macros-simple.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Common Lisp Reader Macros</a> allow you to hook into the reading stage, i.e. the stage that takes a string and produces nested lists and then hands them off to the compiler/evaluator. They require you to choose a unique one- or two-character prefix and they are global. The first one is not so much of a problem, since we can simply choose the <code>&lt;</code> character as our prefix to make it look natural.</p>

<h2><a href=""http://Perl6.Org/"" rel=""nofollow"">Perl 6</a></h2>

<p>Perl 6 should allow you to change the syntax while the program runs. Perl 6 has a dynamic mutable grammar which means that code gets parsed while it is executed and can change the grammar so that other code further down in the file gets parsed using the new grammar.</p>

I.e. languages whose specification and implementation is so lightweight that you can use them for just one line in the middle of your program and then switch to a different syntax again.</p>

<p>It is used in the <a href=""http://VPRI.Org/html/work/ifnct.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">Inventing Fundamental New Computing Technologies</a> at Alan Kay's <a href=""http://VPRI.Org/"" rel=""nofollow"">Viewpoint Research Institute</a>. One example usage is the implementation of an entire TCP/IP networking stack in just 200 lines of code by designing a language whose syntax is identical to the ASCII art diagrams used in IETF RfCs and another language for writing networking protocol state machines. Then, the implementation of the networking stack simply consists of copy&amp;pasting the ASCII diagrams from the RfCs and transiterating the English state machine descriptions from the RfCs into the state machine language.</p>

<p>(Oh, in case you are wondering: the 200 lines is not just for the ASCII diagrams and the state machines. It also includes the parsers and compilers for the two languages.)</p>

"<p>This question is about formatting ruby's strings.</p>

<p>In Python, built-in data structures have a built-in to-string method, and so when a variable is printed, the string is conveniently formatted to be reflective of the data structure used. For example:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;$ python
Python 2.6.4 (r264:75706, Dec  7 2009, 18:45:15)
[GCC 4.4.1] on linux2
Type ""help"", ""copyright"", ""credits"" or ""license"" for more information.
$&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [1,2,3,4]
$&gt;&gt;&gt; str(a)
'[1, 2, 3, 4]'
$&gt;&gt;&gt; print a
[1, 2, 3, 4]
$&gt;&gt;&gt; d = { ""a"":""a"", ""b"":""b"", 1:5 }
$&gt;&gt;&gt; str(d)
""{'a': 'a', 1: 5, 'b': 'b'}""
$&gt;&gt;&gt; print d
{'a': 'a', 1: 5, 'b': 'b'}
$&gt;&gt;&gt; x = [1, 23, 4]
$&gt;&gt;&gt; print x
[1, 23, 4]
</code></pre>

<p>notice that when i print a, the value is <code>[1, 2, 3, 4]</code></p>

<p>However, in ruby, when i try to do the same things, i get this result:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;$ irb
irb(main):001:0&gt; x = [1,23,4]
=&gt; [1, 23, 4]
irb(main):002:0&gt; x.to_s
=&gt; ""1234""
irb(main):003:0&gt; puts x
1
23
4 
=&gt; nil
irb(main):004:0&gt; print x
1234=&gt; nil
irb(main):005:0&gt; h = { ""a"" =&gt; ""a"", 1 =&gt; 5, 'b'=&gt;'b' } 
=&gt; {""a""=&gt;""a"", ""b""=&gt;""b"", 1=&gt;5}
irb(main):006:0&gt; print h 
aabb15=&gt; nil
irb(main):007:0&gt; h.to_s
=&gt; ""aabb15""
irb(main):008:0&gt; puts h
aabb15
=&gt; nil
irb(main):009:0&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, there is no formatting with the to_s method. Furthermore, there's a uniqueness problem if i call to_s on [1,2,3,4] and [1,23,4] and [1234] because the to_s clumps all elements together so they all end up being ""1234"". I know that i can try to emulate the python built-in to-string methods for every native data structure by overriding the to_s method ( ""["" + a.join("","") + ""]"" #just for arrays), but i was wondering if there is a better alternative since hacking it would seem to break the convention-over-configuration concept.</p>

<p>So is there a ruby equivalent of python's built-in to-string method?</p>
","2988","","<p>In Ruby, there are four methods that are typically available for getting a string representation of an object.</p>

<ol>
<li><code>#to_str</code>: this is part of Ruby's standard type conversion protocols (similar to <code>to_int</code>, <code>to_ary</code>, <code>to_float</code>, &hellip;). It is used if and <em>only</em> if the object really actually <em>is</em> a string but for whatever reason is not an instance of the <code>String</code> class. It is extremely unusual. In fact, in the entire core library, there is only the no-op implementation in the <code>String</code> class itself.</li>
<li><code>#to_s</code>: this is also part of Ruby's standard type conversion protocols (similar to <code>to_i</code>, <code>to_a</code>, <code>to_f</code>, &hellip;). It is used if the object has some sort of sensible string representation. It does not actually need to <em>be</em> a string. Almost all objects should respond to this.</li>
<li><code>Kernel#String(obj)</code>: this is also part of Ruby's standard type conversion protocols (similar to <code>Kernel#Integer(obj)</code>, <code>Kernel#Array(obj)</code>, <code>Kernel#Float(obj)</code>, &hellip;). It is the same as <code>obj.to_s</code>.</li>
<li><code>#inspect</code>: it is supposed to return a human-readable description of the object for debugging purposes. In other words: it is for inspecting an object (duh).</li>
</ol>

<p>There are three methods for printing objects:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>Kernel#print(obj, ...)</code>: prints all <code>obj</code>s separated by <code>$,</code> and terminated by <code>$\</code>. If an <code>obj</code> is not a <code>String</code>, <code>print</code> will call <code>obj.to_s</code> first.</li>
<li><code>Kernel#puts(obj, ...)</code>: is basically equivalent to <code>$stdout.puts(obj, ...)</code>. It also prints the <code>obj</code>s, but it typically separates them with newlines. However, it also has some special case behavior, in particular it treats arrays specially by printing each item on a new line.</li>
<li><code>Kernel#p(obj, ...)</code>: similar to <code>puts</code> but calls <code>#inspect</code> on all <code>obj</code>s.</li>
</ol>

<p>In addition to those, there is also the <code>pp</code> (pretty print) library in the standard library which adds a <code>Kernel#pp(obj, ...)</code> method.</p>

<p>Then, there's the <code>awesome_print</code> library and <code>hirb</code>.</p>

"<p>maybe this is just a little misunderstanding but how can a programming language be <strong>implemented</strong>?</p>

<p>I'm not talking about how to implement my own programming language but about the word ""implemented""?
I mean, you can implement a compiler or an interpreter, but a programming language?</p>

<p>What does it mean if I read ""C++ is implemented in C"" or ""Python was implemented in C""?</p>

<p>I think a language is more sth. like a protocol of how someone thinks about things should be implemented. For example, if he wants do display a messagebox he can say the command for this is ShowMessageBox(string) and implement a compiler who will translate this into something that works on a computer (aside from the selected programming paradigms he imagines).</p>

<p>I think this question leads to the question ""what is a programming language in reality""? A compiler, an interpreter or just a documented language standard about how things should be implemented in a language?</p>

<p><strong>[EDIT]</strong></p>

<p>Answer: Languages are never implemented, only compilers/interpreters etc. It's this simple.</p>
","2988","","<p>You are right, those statements don't make any sense. It's pretty obvious that whoever made those statements doesn't understand the difference between a programming language and a compiler (or interpreter).</p>

<p>This is a surprisingly common problem. For example, sometimes people talk about interpreted languages or compiled languages. That's the same thing: languages aren't interpreted or compiled, they just <em>are</em>. Interpretation and compilation are traits of the <em>implementation</em> not the language.</p>

<p>Another goodie: Python has a GIL. No, it doesn't: <em>one</em> implementation of Python has a GIL, all the other implementations don't, and the Python <em>Language</em> itself <em>certainly</em> doesn't. Or: Ruby has green threads. Again, not true: Ruby has threads. Period. Whether any particular language implementation chooses to implement them as green threads, native threads, platform threads or whatever, is  a trait of that particular implementation, not of Ruby. And of course my favorite: Ruby 1.9 is faster than Ruby 1.8. This doesn't even make sense: Ruby 1.9 and Ruby 1.8 are programming languages, i.e. a bunch of abstract mathematical rules. You cannot <em>run</em> a programming language, therefore a programming language can never be ""faster"" or ""slower"" than another one.</p>

<p>The most blatant confusion about the difference between programming languages and implementations is the Computer Language Benchmark Game, which claims to benchmark languages against each other but in fact benchmarks implementations.</p>

<p>All of these are just different expressions of the fact that apparently some people seem to be fundamentally incapable of grasping the concept of abstraction. Or at least the concept of having an abstract language and a concrete implementation of that language.</p>

<p>If we go back to the statement that ""Python is implemented in C"", it should now be obvious that that statement is not just wrong. If the statement were wrong that would imply that the statement even makes sense, i.e. that there is some possible world out there, in which it could at least theoretically be right. But that's not the case. The statement is neither wrong nor right, it simply doesn't make sense. If English were a typed language, it would be a type error.</p>

<p>Python is a programming language. Programming languages aren't implemented in anything. They are just implemented. Compilers and interpreters are implemented in languages. But even if you interpret the statement this way, it isn't true: Jython is implemented in Java, IronPython is implemented in C#, PyPy is implemented in RPython and Python, Pynie is implemented in PGE, NQP and PIR. (Oh, and all of those implementations have compilers, so there goes your ""Python is an interpreted language"".) Similar with Ruby: Rubinius is implemented in Ruby and C++, JRuby and XRuby are implemented in Java, IronRuby and Ruby.NET are implemented in C#, HotRuby is implemented in ECMAScript, Red Sun is implemented in ActionScript, RubyGoLightly is implemented in Go, Cardinal is implemented in PGE, NQP and PIR, SmallRuby is implemented in Smalltalk/X, MagLev is implemented in GemStone Smalltalk and Ruby, YARI is implemented in Io. And for C++: Clang (which is the C, C++ and Objective-C front-end for LLVM) is implemented in C++ (all three front-ends are implemented in C++).</p>

"<p>I've been reading various programming styles like XP (writing the test first), and came across a Java book that just has design patterns, what seems to be like pseudocodes.</p>

<p>What are these design patterns used for ? what does design apttern in the context of programming refer to and what are it's applications ? Is it like blue prints for building a domain specific application ?</p>
","2988","","<p>A Design Pattern is a general reusable solution to a commonly occuring design problem. Actually, we can generalize that: A Pattern is a general reusable solution to a commonly occuring problem. There are not only Design Patterns, there are also Coding Patterns (although we don't call them that, we call them Idioms), Architecture Patterns, User Experience Patterns, Process Patterns etc.</p>

<p>However, there is a small problem with that definition: in programming, we call a general reusable solution to commonly occuring problem a <em>Program</em>. So, in other words, if you have a recurring problem, you write a program, and only if you <em>can't</em> write a program, <em>then</em> you need a Pattern.</p>

<p>So, an alternative definition would be: A Pattern is a Program that you cannot write because your Programming Language is too weak to express it.</p>

<p>So, in general, you should try to use a better Programming Language before you try a Pattern. However, Programming Language Design is all about trade-offs: it's simply impossible to design a Programming Language which can express all problems equally well. So, having some Design Patterns in your code is perfectly fine, but you shouldn't have many of them and you definitely shouldn't have any Patterns in your core business logic. That's a sign that you chose the wrong programming language and no pattern can fix that.</p>

<p>Here's an example: in assembly programming, having a parametric piece of behavior shared between different parts of the program is a commonly occuring design problem. And there is a design pattern that solves that problem: it's called a Subroutine. But in a different language, and in fact in pretty much all modern languages, subroutines (sometimes called procedures, functions, methods, routines, subs) are built right into the language. They aren't a Pattern, they're just there and nobody even thinks about them anymore. So, if you have just one or two subroutines in your code, that's fine. But if you have many of them, assembly is probably not the right choice.</p>

<p>Some other examples: In a prototype-based OO language, the Prototype Pattern is built in. In a language with multiple dispatch, the Visitor Pattern is built in. In Ruby, there are no constructors, you always use Factory Methods without thinking about it. In delegation-based OO languages, the Decorator Pattern is built in. In languages with higher-order procedures, the Iterator Pattern is built in. In languages without mutable state, the Iterator Pattern is actually an <em>Antipattern</em>.</p>

","2988","","<p>The purpose of a class is to group similar objects, or objects with similar behavior together. <code>1</code> and <code>2</code> are very similar, therefore it makes perfect sense for them to be in the same class. <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> however are <em>not</em> similar. In fact, their <em>whole point</em> is that they are exactly the <em>opposite</em> of each other and have opposite behavior. Therefore, they don't belong in the same class.</p>

<p>Can you give an example of what sort of common behavior you would implement in a <code>Boolean</code> class? I can't think of anything.</p>

<p>Let's just look at the behavior that <code>TrueClass</code> and <code>FalseClass</code> have: there's exactly <em>four</em> methods there. No more. And in every single case, the two methods do <em>exactly the opposite</em>. How and why would you put that in a single class?</p>

<p>Here's how you implement all those methods:</p>

<pre><code>class TrueClass
  def &amp;(other)
    other
  end

  def |(_)
    self
  end

  def ^(other)
    !other
  end

  def to_s
    'true'
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>And now the other way around:</p>

<pre><code>class FalseClass
  def &amp;(_)
    self
  end

  def |(other)
    other
  end

  def ^(other)
    other
  end

  def to_s
    'false'
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Granted, in Ruby, there is a lot of ""magic"" that is going on behind the scenes and that is not actually handled by <code>TrueClass</code> and <code>FalseClass</code> but rather hardwired into the interpreter. Stuff like <code>if</code>, <code>&amp;&amp;</code>, <code>||</code> and <code>!</code>. However, in Smalltalk, from which Ruby borrowed a lot including the concept of <code>FalseClass</code> and <code>TrueClass</code>, all of these are implemented as methods as well, and you can do the same thing in Ruby:</p>

<pre><code>class TrueClass
  def if
    yield
  end

  def ifelse(then_branch=-&gt;{}, _=nil)
    then_branch.()
  end

  def unless
  end

  def unlesselse(_=nil, else_branch=-&gt;{})
    ifelse(else_branch, _)
  end

  def and
    yield
  end

  def or
    self
  end

  def not
    false
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>And again the other way around:</p>

<pre><code>class FalseClass
  def if
  end

  def ifelse(_=nil, else_branch=-&gt;{})
    else_branch.()
  end

  def unless
    yield
  end

  def unlesselse(unless_branch=-&gt;{}, _=nil)
    ifelse(_, unless_branch)
  end

  def and
    self
  end

  def or
    yield
  end

  def not
    true
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>A couple of years ago, I wrote the above just for fun and <a href=""http://JoergWMittag.GitHub.Com/b001e/"">even published it</a>. Apart from the fact that the syntax looks different because Ruby uses special operators while I use only methods, it behaves exactly like Ruby's builtin operators.

"<p><br>I wonder why other languages do not support this feature. What I can understand that C / C++ code is platform dependent so to make it work (compile and execute) across various platform, is achieved by using preprocessor directives.

  <p>What the current stable recommended release of Ruby? 1.8.7 or 1.9.x?</p>

<p>It depends on what exactly you are talking about: deployment to production? Development? Testing?</p>

<p>Personally, for production, I would recommend the not-yet-but-real-soon-now-released Ruby 1.9.2 if you can get away with it, otherwise stick with Ruby 1.8.7 plus Marc-André Lafortune's <code>backports</code> library for the time being.</p>

<p>For development, use Ruby 1.9.2.</p>

<p>For testing, use Ruby 1.9.2 if you deploy to Ruby 1.9.2, otherwise if you deploy to Ruby 1.8.7, use <em>both</em> Ruby 1.9.2 and Ruby 1.8.7 (to ensure that you don't accidentally introduce any ""1.8isms"" that would prevent you from updating later. This includes dependencies on third-party libraries that don't yet work on Ruby 1.9.)</p>

<p>I don't think it makes much sense to use Ruby 1.9.1 right now. Ruby 1.9.2 is going to be released very soon and it has some small but important improvements and changes plus some really nifty enhancements over 1.9.1.</p>

  <p>[...] what are kind the ruby + rails + gems compatibility issues, that one should watch out for.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Upgrading from Ruby 1.8 to Ruby 1.9 is pretty easy but it is somewhat time-consuming. (In my case, I had to change almost all of my files in some way or another, but all of the changes were completely trivial.) Unfortunately, this means that there are still third-party libraries out there that don't work on Ruby 1.9. And if you depend on one of those, then you are screwed. You can get an overview of what works and what doesn't on the <a href=""http://IsItRuby19.Com/"" rel=""nofollow""><em>Is It Ruby 1.9?</em></a> website.</p>

<p>Note, however, that there is usually a much bigger problem than what version of Ruby you are using and that is what <em>implementation</em> of Ruby you are using. Pretty much all implementations of Ruby have their own private extension API and extensions that are for example written for MRI, don't necessarily work on YARV, REE or Rubinius and they <em>certainly</em> don't work on JRuby or IronRuby. For some strange reason, Ruby programmers seem to hate Ruby and much prefer writing C instead, which unfortunately means that their code is intimately tied to one particular implementation of Ruby and doesn't work in others.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I would love to use 1.9.x, since I have heard it provides significant performance improvements.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is a very common misconception that unfortunately doesn't want to die. Ruby 1.9 is in no way, shape or form faster (or slower) than Ruby 1.8, for the simple reason that Ruby 1.9 is a programming language and a programming language is just a bunch of abstract mathematical rules. A programming language isn't fast or slow. It just <em>is</em>. You cannot execute a bunch of abstract mathematical rules.</p>

<p>The only thing that is relevant when it comes to performance is which <em>execution engine</em> you are using, the version of the language is completely irrelevant.</p>

<p>Right now, there are five Ruby execution engines that are generally considered to be of production-ready quality: IronRuby 1.1, JRuby 1.5.1, Rubinius 1.0.1, YARV 1.9.1-p429 (and also I personally consider YARV 1.9.2-RC2 to be production-ready) and MRI 1.8.7-p299.</p>

<p>IronRuby 1.1 is an implementation of Ruby 1.8.6 for the ISO CLI (or more specifically for the DLR, which is a Dynamic Language Runtime for the ISO CLI).</p>

<p>JRuby 1.5.1 is an implementation of <em>both</em> Ruby 1.9.2-trunk (as of revision 24787) and Ruby 1.8.7-p249 for the JVM.</p>

<p>Rubinius 1.0.1 is an implementation of Ruby 1.8.7 (I don't know which patchlevel) for Unix-ish systems.</p>

<p>YARV 1.9.1-p429 is an implementation of Ruby 1.9.1-p429 for Unix-ish systems as well as Windows (plus a couple of others).</p>

<p>MRI 1.8.7-p299 is an implementation of Ruby 1.8.7-p299 for Unix-ish systems as well as Windows (plus a couple of others).</p>

<p>Then, there is Ruby Enterprise Edition 1.8.7-2010.02. REE is a minor variant of MRI, produced by Phusion, the same company that also produces Passenger. In particular, REE 1.8.7-2010.02 is based on MRI 1.8.7-p249 (and thus implements Ruby 1.8.7-p249), but it adds some backports for compatibility problems that were fixed in Ruby 1.8.7-p299. The main difference between REE and MRI, however, is that while MRI is specifically tuned for short-running scripts which don't allocate much memory, REE is specifically tuned for long-running server processes which allocate significant amounts of memory.</p>

<p>In terms of performance, in my personal experience, JRuby is the fastest, and it doesn't actually matter whether you run it in 1.8 mode or 1.9 mode. Although you have to be careful: JRuby itself doesn't actually do any interesting work, it mostly depends on the JVM for performance. Therefore, you need to run JRuby on a modern high-performance JVM such as the server version of Oracle HotSpot 1.6.0u21 with the C2 compiler or Oracle JRockit R28.0.1 for it to really shine. The difference becomes really dramatic when running multithreaded code on a multicore machine (such as for example Azul Systems' 864-core Java appliance), because MRI, YARV, REE and Rubinius cannot actually run multiple threads in parallel and thus are only ever going to use at most one core, whereas JRuby and IronRuby will happily use all available cores.</p>

<p>In most benchmarks, YARV is equal to or slightly ahead of JRuby, but I have found that those benchmarks tend not to be very representative of the code I write, so for my code, JRuby is almost always significantly faster than YARV. Unless your company happens to be in the business of selling Fibonacci Numbers, the Ruby Benchmark Suite is probably not going to tell you much, especially since those benchmarks tend to only run for seconds, whereas Rails apps tend to run for months.</p>

<p>However, note that Phusion Passenger only supports MRI, REE and YARV.</p>

"<p>Does reflection break the idea of private methods? Because private methods can be accessed from outside of the class? (Maybe I don't understand the meaning of reflection or miss something else, please tell me)
<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_%28computer_science%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_%28computer_science%29</a></p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>
If relection breaks the idea of private methods - do we use private methods only for program logic and not for program security?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
","2988","","<p>No, reflection doesn't break the idea of private methods. At least not per se. There is nothing that says that reflection can't obey access restrictions.</p>

<p><em>Badly designed</em> reflection breaks the idea of private methods, but that doesn't have anything to do with reflection per se: <em>anything</em> which is badly designed can break the idea of private methods. In particular, a bad design of private methods can also obviously break the idea of private methods.</p>

<p>What do I mean by <em>badly designed</em>? Well, as I said above, there is nothing stopping you from having a language in which reflection obeys access restrictions. The problem with this is that e.g. debuggers, profilers, coverage tools, IntelliSense, IDEs, tools in general <em>need</em> to be able to violate access restrictions. Since there is no way to present different different versions of reflection to different clients, most languages opt for tools over safety. (E is the counterexample, which has absolutely no reflective capabilities whatsoever, as a conscious design choice.)</p>

<p>But, who says that you cannot present different versions of reflection to different clients? Well, the problem is simply that in the classical implementation of reflection, all objects are reponsible for reflecting on themselves, and since there is only one of every object, there can be only version of reflection.</p>

<p>So, where does the idea of <em>bad design</em> come in? Well, note the word ""responsible"" in the above paragraph. Every object is responsible for reflecting on itself. Also, every object is responsible for whatever it is that it was written for in the first place. In other words: every object has at least <em>two</em> responsibilities. This violates one of the basic principles of object-oriented design: the Single Responsibility Principle.</p>

<p>The solution is rather simple: break up the object. The original object is simply responsible for whatever it was originally written for. And there is another object (called a <em>Mirror</em> because it is an object that reflects other objects) which is responsible for reflection. And now that the responsibility for reflection is broken out into a separate object, what's stopping us from having not one, but two, three, <em>many</em> Mirror Objects? One that respects access restrictions, one that only allows an object to reflect upon itself but not any other objects, one that only allows introspection (i.e. is read-only), one that only allows to reflect on read-only callsite information (i.e. for a profiler), one that gives full access to the entire system including violating access restrictions (for a debugger), one that only gives read-only access to the method names and signatures and respects access restrictions (for IntelliSense) and so on &hellip;</p>

<p>As a nice bonus, this means that Mirrors are essentially Capabilities (in the capability-security sense of the word) for reflection. IOW: Mirrors are the Holy Grail on the decade-long quest to reconcile security and runtime dynamic metaprogramming.</p>

<p>The concept of Mirrors was originally invented in <a href=""http://SelfLanguage.Org/"" rel=""nofollow"">Self</a> from where it carried over into <a href=""http://Strongtalk.Org/"" rel=""nofollow"">Animorphic Smalltalk/Strongtalk</a> and then <a href=""http://NewspeakLanguage.Org/"" rel=""nofollow"">Newspeak</a>. Interestingly, the Java Debugging Interface is based on Mirrors, so the designers of Java (or rather the JVM) clearly knew about them, but Java's reflection is broken.</p>

"<p>I want to define a Nibble type.</p>

<p>I want that if the user sets the value higher than <code>0xf</code>, it should generate a compiler error.</p>

<p>Is this possible?</p>
","2988","","<p>It looks like the easiest way to achieve what you want is a subrange type. Languages which support subrange types are pretty much all languages in the Algol68 line of succession (Algol68, Pascal, Modula-2, Oberon, Component Pascal) and their cousings and derivatives (Turbo Pascal, Borland Pascal, FreePascal, Delphi, Kylix, Object Pascal) as well as Ada. I believe that you can implement subrange types in C++ using some heavy template-fu. You can probably implement them in languages with more expressive type systems, such as Scala, Haskell, ML, Agda, Epigram, Guru.</p>

<p>I have no idea why not more languages support subrange types. They are obviously useful, easy to use, easy to understand, easy to implement.</p>

<p>Another possibility might be Fortress. In Fortress, the various fixed-width integer types are not actually built into the language, they are user-defined. So, there is no reason why you should not be able to build <em>your own</em> user-defined fixed-width integer type.</p>

"<p>I have seen programmers ""battling"" it out with really complex mathematical problems in their codes, particularly in the fields of game programming, physics programming, graphics programming, etc. I am a web developer, and I wonder if there are math concepts out there that I can use for web programming. I started web programming a year and 2 months ago, and all I have dealt with were complex analysis of systems, database queries, user interface designs, simple data structures, complex data manipulation and interpretation (regexes, parsing, etc) but I have not (yet) found a need for complex math.</p>

<p>So to repeat the question, are there mathematical concepts out there that can leverage my web development skills? If there are, what scenarios are do they come as an advantage or indispensable?</p>
","2988","","<p>There is a very nice <a href=""http://Vimeo.Com/5318303/"" rel=""nofollow"">presentation</a> and <a href=""http://Amazon.Com/dp/143022844X/"" rel=""nofollow"">upcoming book</a> by <a href=""http://BioSimilarity.BlogSpot.Com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Gregory Meredith</a> on Monadic Design Patterns for the Web. (There's also going to be a Video Lecture Series about this topic by Gregory Meredith himself on <a href=""http://Channel9.MSDN.Com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Channel9</a> sometime in the next months.) It probably doesn't get more mathy than Monads or Category Theory (which is where Monads come from) in general.</p>

<p>Another nice example is the fact that Interactive Programming (and especially the Iterator Design Pattern) and Reactive Programming (and especially the Subject/Observer Design Pattern) are category-theoretical duals of each other. Also, it turns out that the Iterator Design Pattern can be implemented as an instance of the List Monad and the Subject/Observer Design Pattern can be implemented as an instance of the Continuation Monad. Since both are Monads, this basically means that you can deal with <em>both</em> using <em>the same tools</em>.</p>

<p>In other words, you can deal with <em>event streams</em> (which are generally thought hard to deal with) the same way you do with <em>collections</em> (which everybody already knows how to do). For example, in .NET, this means that you can ""query"" event streams using LINQ, since really LINQ is nothing but Monad Comprehensions dressed up as SQL queries so that enterprise programmers don't get scared by big words such as ""Monad"".</p>

<p>And, of course, Web Programming is <em>all about</em> Reactive Programming. The browser constantly fires events at you that you must react to. And all of the asynchronous I/O stuff (database, file, you name it) is all about firing off your I/O request and then waiting for a completion event.</p>

"<p>There is a very noticeable difference in application initiation time between running my specs from the command line with ruby 1.9.x vs. 1.8.7.  My application initiates much faster with ruby 1.8.7 than with ruby 1.9.1 or 1.9.2.  The application initiation difference is approximately 18 seconds.  It takes about 5 seconds for my app to initialize with 1.8.7 and 23 seconds with 1.9.1 and 1.9.2.</p>

<p>Application initialization time is not a big deal for production, but it is a very big deal for BDD development.  Every time I change my code and run my specs, I have to wait an additional 18 seconds per iteration.</p>

<p>I assume this application initialization time is attributed to YARV compiling bytecode as my application initializes.</p>

<p>Am I right about my YARV slowing down my application initialization, and is there a way to disable YARV on the command line.  It would be very nice to be able to disable YARV only when I am running my specs.</p>
","2988","","<p>YARV is a pure Ruby compiler. If you disable it, there's nothing left.</p>

<p>More precisely: YARV is a multi-phase implementation, where each of the phases is single-mode. It consists of a Ruby-to-YARV compiler and a YARV interpreter. If you remove the compiler, the only thing you are left with is the YARV bytecode interpreter. Unless you want to start writing your app in YARV bytecode, that interpreter is not going to be of much use to you.</p>

<p>This is in contrast to mixed-mode implementations such as JRuby and IronRuby which implement multiple execution modes (in particular, both a compiler and an interpreter) within a <em>single</em> phase. If you turn off the compiler in JRuby or IronRuby, you are still left with a usable execution engine, because they both also contain an interpreter. In fact, JRuby actually started out as a pure interpreter and added the compiler later and IronRuby started out as pure <em>compiler</em> and they added an interpreter <em>exactly</em> because of the same problem that you are seeing: compiling unit tests is simply a waste of time.</p>

<p>The only interpreted implementation of Ruby 1.9 right now is JRuby. Of course, there you have the whole JVM overhead to deal with. The best thing you can do is try how fast you can get JRuby to start up (use the nightly 1.6.0.dev builds from <a href=""http://CI.JRuby.Org/snapshots/"">http://CI.JRuby.Org/snapshots/</a> since both 1.9 support and startup time are heavily worked on right this very moment) using either some very fast starting desktop-oriented JVM like IBM J9 or try JRuby's Nailgun support, which keeps a JVM running in the background.</p>

<p>You could also try to get rid of RubyGems, which generally eats up quite a lot of startup time, especially on YARV. (Use the <code>--disable-gem</code> commandline option to truly get rid of it.)</p>

"<p>As a ruby newbie, I was wondering, will gems ever conflict with eachother? For example, if 2 gems overrode the &lt;&lt; method on array, which would win, or is there something to stop this?</p>

","2988","","<p>I assume you are talking about redefining methods, not overriding them, right? If two libraries overrode the same method in two different subclasses, there wouldn't be any problem.</p>

<p>If two or more libraries redefine the same method, then whichever one happens to be loaded last wins. In fact, this is actually no different than just <em>one</em> library redefining a method: the Ruby interpreter provides an implementation of <code>Array#&lt;&lt;</code> for you, and if you redefine it, your definition wins, simply because it came later.</p>

<p>The best way to stop this is simple: don't run around screwing with existing methods. And don't use libraries that do. The <code>-w</code> commandline flag to enable warnings is very helpful there, since at least in Ruby 1.9.2 it prints a warning if methods get redefined.</p>

<p>In Ruby 2.0, there will probably be some kind of mechanism to isolate method (re-)definitions into some kind of namespace.

<li>Forth</li>
<li>Mesa</li>
<li>CPL</li>
<li>BCPL (simplified version of CPL, implementation language of MULTICS)</li>
<li>B (Ken Thompsons first try at a systems programming language, based loosely on BCPL, precursor to C)</li>
<li>Ada</li>
<li><a href=""http://GoLang.Org/"">Go</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://DigitalMars.Com/d/"">D</a></li>
<li>C++</li>
<li>Modula-2 (specifically designed for the Lilith personal computer as a successor to Pascal for systems programming, also used by IBM as the implementation language for the original OS/400)</li>
<li>Oberon (specifically designed as a simpler successor to Modula-2)</li>
<li>Component Pascal (object-oriented successor to Oberon, despite the name it is not a direct successor to Pascal)</li>
<li>Modula-3 (despite the name not a successor to Modula-2 but an independent development)</li>
<li><a href=""http://Wikipedia.Org/wiki/Sing_Sharp"">Sing#</a> (the implementation language of Microsoft Research's Singularity Research OS)</li>
<li>Limbo (language for the Inferno operating system (successor to Plan 9 (successor to Unix)))</li>
<li><a href=""http://Ooc-Lang.Org/"">Ooc</a></li>
<li>Erlang (maybe not for operating systems, but embedded realtime systems, especially in the telco industry (phone switches etc.), also lately (somewhat surprising to Erlang's inventors, actually) web servers, databsase systems, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Interestingly, there are also a number of languages that were <em>not</em> specifically designed to fill that niche, but that have been very successfully <em>used</em> in that niche:</p>

<ul>
<li>Smalltalk (several Smalltalk OSs, embedded systems, microcontrollers, realtime systems, most famous: the Tektronix TDS500 series of digital oscilloscopes)</li>
<li>Lisp (several Lisp OSs, embedded systems, microcontrollers, some NASA spacecraft)</li>
<li>Java (several Java OSs (JNode, NewOS), embedded systems, microcontrollers, smartcards)</li>
<li>C# (several OSs (Cosmos, SharpOS), Mono is used in High-Performance Computing)</li>
<li>Haskell (the House OS, the seL4 verified microkernel)</li>
<li>Pascal (MacOS)</li>
</ul>

<p>There's also a lot of languages that have not yet been used in that niche, but that certainly <em>could</em> be. (Mostly that is because those language communities themselves have been so indoctrinated by the ""you can only write operating systems in C"" bullshit that they actually believe their own language to be unusable.)</p>

<ul>
<li>Ruby</li>
<li>Python</li>
<li>ECMAScript (which <em>is</em> actually used for writing high-performance webservers lately)</li>
</ul>

<p>[Note that for each one of the three categories I listed there are literally thousands more languages that fit in there.]</p>

<p>In fact, one sometimes gets the feeling that languages which are <em>not</em> specifically designed for, say, operating system programming are actually <em>better</em> for that kind of thing. Compare, for example, the level of innovation, the stability, number of security holes, performance in something like a Smalltalk OS from the 1970s and Windows or OSX from 2010.</p>

<p>Personally, I believe that this is based on some deep-seated myths in the systems programming community. They believe that systems programming in a language with, say, strong typing, type safety, memory safety, pointer safety, automatic storage management is impossible and that the only way to get performance or realtime guarantees is to forego powerful abstraction facilities. However, it turns out that when you try to design a programming language for <em>humans</em> instead of machines, then humans can actually understand the programs they wrote, find security holes, fix bugs and locate and fix performance bottlenecks much better in a 1 line monad comprehension than in a 100 line for loop.</p>

<p>For example SqueakNOS, which is a variant of the Squeak Smalltalk system that runs without an OS (in other words: it <em>is</em> the OS) has pretty much all of the features that you would expect from a modern OS (graphical user interface, ...) plus some that you don't (embedded scripting language that can modify every single piece of the OS at runtime) and weighs in at just 300k SLOC and boots in less than 5 seconds while e.g. Windows weighs in at 50 <em>million</em> SLOC.</p>

  def initialize(input)
    @input = input.dup
    @rgb, @hex, @data = [], [], []
  end

  def parse
    parse_element until @input.empty?
    return @rgb, @hex, @data
  end

  private

  def parse_element
    parse_color or parse_stop_word
  end

  def parse_color
    parse_rgb or parse_hex
  end

  def parse_rgb
    return unless /rgb/i =~ peek
    @rgb &lt;&lt; consume
    parse_rgb_values
  end
</code></pre>

<p>I really like recursive-descent parsers because their structure almost perfectly matches the grammar: just keep parsing elements until the input is empty. What is an element? Well, it's a color specification or a stop word. What is a color specification? Well, it's either an RGB color specification or a hex color specification. What is an RGB color specification? Well, it's something that matches the Regexp <code>/rgb/i</code> followed by RGB values. What are RGB values? Well, it's just three numbers &hellip;</p>

<pre><code>  def parse_rgb_values
    3.times do @rgb &lt;&lt; consume.to_i end
  end

  def parse_hex
    return unless /hex/i =~ peek
    @hex &lt;&lt; consume
    parse_hex_value
  end

  def parse_hex_value
    @hex &lt;&lt; consume.to_i(16)
  end

  def parse_stop_word
    @data &lt;&lt; consume unless /rgb|hex/i =~ peek
  end

  def consume
    @input.slice!(0)
  end

  def peek
    @input.first
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Use it like so:</p>

<pre><code>data = %w[start before rgb 255 255 255 hex FFFFFF after end]
rgb, hex, rest = ColorParser.new(data).parse

require 'pp'

pp rgb, hex, rest
# [""rgb"", 255, 255, 255]
# [""hex"", 16777215]
# [""start"", ""before"", ""after"", ""end""]
</code></pre>

<p>For comparison, here's the grammar:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>S</em> &rarr; <em>element</em><code>*</code></li>
<li><em>element</em> &rarr; <em>color</em> <code>|</code> <em>word</em></li>
<li><em>color</em> &rarr; <em>rgb</em> <code>|</code> <em>hex</em></li>
<li><em>rgb</em> &rarr; <kbd>rgb</kbd> <em>rgbvalues</em></li>
<li><em>rgbvalues</em> &rarr; <strong>token</strong>  <strong>token</strong>  <strong>token</strong></li>
<li><em>hex</em> &rarr; <kbd>hex</kbd> <em>hexvalue</em></li>

</code></pre>

<p>Given this piece of JSON, how would I be able to loop through and pull out all of the ""hometown"" and ""location"" keys and see which people had the value of New York? </p>

<p>My issue is I can Array.each through these items, but I don't know how to traverse both location &amp;&amp; hometown with my criteria (""New York"").  </p>
","2988","","<pre><code>people.select {|person|
  person.any? {|k, v|
    %w[location hometown].include?(k) &amp;&amp; /New York/ =~ v['name']
}}
</code></pre>

<p>This basically says the following: select all entries in the array for which the following condition is true. The condition is: is it true for any of the key-value pairs that the key is either <code>'hometown'</code> or <code>'location'</code> and the <code>name</code> property of the value belonging to that key matches the Regexp <code>/New York/</code>?</p>

<p>However, your object model seems to be in a serious need of refactoring. In fact, the main problem is that your object model isn't even an object model, it's a hash and array model.</p>

<p>Here's what I mean by a proper object model:</p>

<pre><code>class Person
  attr_reader :name, :location, :hometown

  def initialize(name, location=nil, hometown=nil)
    @name, @location, @hometown = name, location, hometown
  end

  def cities
    return @location, @hometown
  end
end

class City
  attr_reader :id, :name

  def initialize(id, name)
    @id, @name = id, name
  end

  def =~(other)
    name =~ other
  end
end

nyc = City.new(12746342329, 'New York, New York')
brooklyn = City.new(43453644, 'Brooklyn, New York')
miami = City.new(12746342329, 'Miami, Florida')
queens = City.new(12746329, 'Queens, New York')

john = Person.new('John Doe', nyc, brooklyn)
jane = Person.new('Jane Doe', miami, queens)

people = [john, jane]
</code></pre>

<p>If you have such a proper object model, your code becomes much cleaner, because instead of teasing apart the nuts of bults of a nested maze of hashes and arrays, you have nice little objects that you can simply ask some questions:</p>

<pre><code>people.select {|person| person.cities.any? {|city| city =~ /New York/ }}
</code></pre>

<p>You can almost read this like English: from the array select all people for which any of their cities matches the Regexp <code>/New York/</code>.</p>

<p>If we improve the object model further, it gets even better:</p>

<pre><code>class Person
  def lived_in?(pattern)
    cities.any? {|city| city =~ pattern }
  end
end

people.select {|person| person.lived_in?(/New York/) }
</code></pre>

<p>This basically says ""From the people, select the ones which at one time lived in New York"". That's much better than ""from the people select all for which the first element of the key value pair is either the string <code>'hometown'</code> or the string <code>'location'</code> and the second element of the key value pair matches the Regexp <code>/New York/</code>"".</p>

"<p>I am trying to create instances of objects of various types by iterating and checking for validity. I need an array of types so I can do something like this:</p>

","2988","","<p>Apart from the obvious syntactic errors (e.g. <code>in</code> is a reseved word, and <code>null</code> is spelled <code>nil</code> in Ruby), the code you showed should work just fine as it is, and indeed it does when I copy&amp;paste it into my Ruby installation. This assumes, of course, that the classes <code>Foo::A</code>, <code>Foo::B</code> and <code>Foo::C</code> actually exist. If they don't, then the code obviously cannot possibly work.</p>

<p>It is, however, completely un-Rubyish and violates just about every coding convention in the book:</p>

<ol>
<li>indentation is 2 spaces</li>
<li>method names are <code>snake_case</code>, not <code>camelCase</code></li>
<li>explicitly checking for equality to <code>nil</code> is a no-no, simply calling <code>#nil?</code> is much preferred</li>
<li><code>try_classes</code> isn't exactly an intention-revealing method name</li>
<li>and WTF does <code>in</code> mean?</li>
<li>Rubyists much prefer higher-order methods over explicit looping</li>
</ol>

<p>Here's a more Rubyish version of the code you wrote:</p>

<pre><code>def can_create_object?(*args)
  [Foo::A, Foo::B, Foo::C].none? do |klass|
    klass.new(*args).nil?
  end
end
</code></pre>

"
"<p>It's a best-practice question. There are obvious ways to do that, none of them just seem quite right.</p>

  World greets you
EOS
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>With <code>&lt;&lt;-</code> I can indent here doc marker, but it doesn't strip indentation inside heredoc, it still looks horrible.</p>

<pre><code>class TestHelloWorld &lt; Test::Unit::TestCase
  def test_hello
    assert_equal &lt;&lt;-EOS, hello_world
Hello, world!
  World greets you
    EOS
  end

<p>This lets me indent but readability of test line suffers. This <code>gsub</code> really doesn't feel right here.</p>

  def test_hello
    assert_equal &lt;&lt;-EOS.gsub(/^ {6}/, """"), hello_world
      Hello, world!
        World greets you
    EOS
  end

<p>Is there any way to test such multi-line strings that's really readable?</p>
","2988","","<p>Personally, I think that Ruby's indented heredocs are useless and they should work more like Bash indented heredocs and also strip whitespace <em>inside</em> the string &hellip;</p>

","2988","","<p>Buildr is a framework of Rake tasks that is explicitly designed as a replacement for Ant and Maven to build Java applications. I know that at least the guys who wrote Buildr actually use it to build their Java projects, plus I heard of several other people and companies using either Buildr or raw Rake for Java. I also heard the same about C#.</p>

<p>I also know some Ruby companies that have branched out into other fields (Objective-C, JavaScript) and took Rake with them to build their mobile projects, for example.</p>

<p>And of course, depending on whether you define that as a non-Ruby project or not, IronRuby uses Rake for building. You could obviously argue that this is a Ruby project, but it's not Ruby <em>code</em>, it's 99% C# and a dash of XML.</p>

<p>There was also a talk a couple of years ago at one of the regional Ruby conferences about an embedded company that uses <code>test/unit</code> for testing and Rake for building their C and even assembly code.</p>

"<p>In my existing software I have an implementation of genetic programing using home grown decission making tree that is able to apply basic logic operators (AND OR NOT) in some boolean data that are provided to it in a form of an array.  The platform I am using is .NET / C# with SQLServer back end.   Looking for ways to improve the performance of my genetic program I concluded that I need almost all the additional functionality that comes with a functional language and I believe Scheme or to a lesser extend LISP are the best solutions for it unless I want to implement features like COND, IF, comparisson operators etc myself extending the existing implementation.</p>

<p>My question to the forum is if there is any efficient way to call Scheme (or LISP) from a .NET application passing data back and front in some array form.  If this is not possible, do you thing that it will better just to bite the bullet and implement it from scratch or I should look for alternative ways, like for example communicating using a text file?  </p>

(There's also the variants <a href=""http://Ruby-Doc.Org/ruby-1.9/classes/Module.html#M000942""><code>Module#public_method_defined?</code></a>, <a href=""http://Ruby-Doc.Org/ruby-1.9/classes/Module.html#M000944""><code>Module#protected_method_defined?</code></a> and <a href=""http://Ruby-Doc.Org/ruby-1.9/classes/Module.html#M000943""><code>Module#private_method_defined?</code></a>.) The problem is with your call to <code>def_method</code>, which doesn't exist. (It's called <a href=""http://Ruby-Doc.Org/ruby-1.9/classes/Module.html#M000948""><code>Module#define_method</code></a>).</p>

<p>This works like a charm:</p>

<pre><code>class C1      
  define_method(:hello) do
    puts 'Hi Everyone'
  end unless method_defined? :hello
end
</code></pre>

<p>However, since you already know the name in advance and don't use any closure, there is no need to use <code>Module#define_method</code>, you can just use the <code>def</code> keyword instead:</p>

<pre><code>class C1
  def hello
    puts 'Hi Everyone'
  end unless method_defined? :hello
end
</code></pre>

<p>Or have I misunderstood your question and you are worried about inheritance? In that case, <code>Module#method_defined?</code> is not the right choice, because it walks the entire inheritance chain. In that case, you will have to use <a href=""http://Ruby-Doc.Org/ruby-1.9/classes/Module.html#M000919""><code>Module#instance_methods</code></a> or one of its cousins <a href=""http://Ruby-Doc.Org/ruby-1.9/classes/Module.html#M000920""><code>Module#public_instance_methods</code></a>, <a href=""http://Ruby-Doc.Org/ruby-1.9/classes/Module.html#M000921""><code>Module#protected_instance_methods</code></a> or <a href=""http://Ruby-Doc.Org/ruby-1.9/classes/Module.html#M000922""><code>Module#private_instance_methods</code></a>, which take an optional argument telling them whether to include methods from superclasses / mixins or not. (Note that the documentation is wrong: if you pass no arguments, it <em>will</em> include all the inherited methods.)</p>

<pre><code>class C1
  unless instance_methods(false).include? :hello

"<p>I'm looking for things like Dynamic typing, Static Typing, Weak Typing, and Strong Typing.</p>

<p>As well as OO features like polymorphism, inheritance, nested classes, inner classes, abstract classes, pure virtual functions.</p>

<p>Also, things like reflection, static binding, dynamic binding, etc. </p>

<p>However, I'm not really looking for things like control flow, built-in types, or syntactic sugar ie.  A[5] vs A.get(5). Though, it wouldn't hurt.</p>

<p>It would be awesome if something like this existed and also mapped these concepts to particular languages.</p>

<p>I know that many of these features are explained on Wikipedia already, but are not quickly accessible unless I already know what these features are (and I remember) or just happen to find an interrelated link.  In fact the only time I use Wikipedia for something like this is if I just happen to see someone reference an idea, which I need to look up.  </p>

<p>My main goal is to have a way for me to quickly discover or brush up my knowledge on these concepts and an authoritative list like this would be very helpful.</p>

<p>If something like this does not exist, why? </p>

<p>Is it because different programming languages decided to name some of these things differently but actually do the same thing? (ie. Pure virtual function (C++) vs. abstract methods (Java))  While others may name things the same, but do something slightly different? (The Protected keyword in Java vs. C++)  Another reason might be is languages simply don't have enough features in common to compile a list like this and it's better to learn a language and it's features one at a time?  In which case I'd probably compile my own ""feature list"" as I learned the language...</p>

<p>Thanks for reading! :)</p>
","2988","","<p>Very good explanations of programming paradigms and the programming concepts from which those paradigms are built are found in Peter van Roy's works. Especially in the book <a href=""http://WWW.Info.UCL.Ac.Be/~pvr/book""><em>Concepts, Techniques, and Models of Computer Programming</em> by Peter Van Roy and Seif Haridi</a>. (<a href=""http://CodePoetics.Com/wiki/"">Here's the companion wiki.</a>) CTM (as it is colloquially known in the industry) uses the <a href=""http://WWW.Mozart-Oz.Org/"">multi-paradigm Distributed Oz programming language</a> to introduce all the major programming paradigms.</p>

<p>Peter van Roy also made <a href=""http://WWW.Info.UCL.Ac.Be/~pvr/paradigms"">this amazing poster that shows the 34 major paradigms and their relations and positions on various axis</a>. The poster is basically an incredibly compressed version of CTM. A more thorough explanation of that poster is contained in the article <a href=""http://WWW.Info.UCL.Ac.Be/~pvr/VanRoyChapter"">Programming Paradigms for Dummies: What Every Programmer Should Know</a> which appeared as a chapter in the book <em>New Computational Paradigms for Computer Music</em>, edited by G. Assayag and A. Gerzso. It explains for example very concisely and easily understandable, what a programming paradigm actually <em>is</em>, what a programming concept is, and how the two are related.</p>

<p><em>Another</em> great book that demonstrates several major programming paradigms is <a href=""http://MITPress.MIT.Edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html""><em>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</em> by Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman</a>. This book was the basis of MIT's Introduction to Programming (6.001) for undergrads for several decades. <a href=""http://SWISS.CSAIL.MIT.Edu/classes/6.001/abelson-sussman-lectures/"">A course taught by Abelson and Sussman themselves was recorded at a corporate training for Hewlett-Packard in 1986</a>.</p>

<p>You can find <a href=""http://OCW.MIT.Edu/OcwWeb/Electrical-Engineering-and-Computer-Science/6-001Spring-2005/CourseHome/"">video recordings and course materials from the Spring 2005 course on MIT's OpenCourseWare website</a>. <a href=""http://ADUni.Org/courses/sicp/"">Another recording of the course from MIT's short-lived ArsDigita University project</a>. SICP has also been taught at other universities, in fact <a href=""http://WebCast.Berkeley.Edu/course_details_new.php?seriesid=2010-B-26275"">the 2010 course at Berkeley has just finished</a>.</p>

<p>SICP, as it is colloquially known, is probably one of <em>the</em> best programming books ever written.</p>

<p>The main difference between SICP and CTM is the didactic approach: CTM demonstrates most major paradigms using an extremely powerful multi-paradigm language that <em>already</em> supports them (mostly Distributed Oz, but also some others). SICP OTOH demonstrates them by <em>implementing</em> them in a language that does <em>not</em> support them natively (a subset of Scheme). IOW: CTM would teach OO be showing programs written in an OO language, SICP by implementing an OO system in Scheme. Seeing Object-Orientation implemented in a dozen or so lines of code is friggin' awesome.</p>

<p><a href=""http://MITPress.MIT.Edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=11656""><em>Design Concepts in Programming Languages</em> (by Franklyn A. Turbak and David K. Gifford with Mark A. Sheldon)</a> is another great related book.</p>

<p><a href=""http://Amazon.Com/dp/0136073476/""><em>Concepts of Programming Languages</em> (by Robert W. Sebesta)</a> explains, well, Concepts of Programming Languages, starting with Konrad Zuse's Plankalkül, continuing with the first <em>real</em> programming languages like Fortran, Lisp, Cobol, Algol, BASIC and on to C, C++, Java and Ada.</p>

<p><a href=""http://Theory.Stanford.Edu/~jcm/books.html""><em>Concepts in Programming Languages</em> (by John C. Mitchell)</a> is another book that is often cited but that I haven't yet read myself, unfortunately.</p>

<p>Ditto for  <a href=""http://EoPL3.Com/""><em>Essentials of Programming Languages</em></a> (by Daniel P. Friedman and Mitchell Wand) aka <em>EoPL</em>.</p>

<p><a href=""http://WWW.CS.Rochester.Edu/~scott/pragmatics/""><em>Programming Language Pragmatics</em> (by Michael L. Scott)</a> is more about implementing programming language concepts, however it also talks <em>about</em> them in a way that is reportedly very accessible. (Again, I haven't read this one.)</p>

<p>Since you asked a lot about typing specifically, I would be remiss in not mentioning <a href=""http://WWW.CIS.UPenn.Edu/~bcpierce/tapl/""><em>Types and Programming Languages</em></a> (by Benjamin C. Pierce), or <em>TaPL</em> as it is usually called. This is basically <em>the</em> book about Type Theory as it relates to Programming Languages. Note, however, that its view on types is not uncontroversial: for example, it pretty much flat out denies the existence of dynamic typing.</p>

<p>To balance out that very strict definition by Pierce, you should definitely read the brilliant <a href=""http://LucaCardelli.Name/Papers/TypefulProg.A4.pdf""><em>Typeful Programming</em></a> by Luca Cardelli. In the paper, he argues that programming using types as a modeling and structuring construct instead of just mere safety net, is a programming paradigm in its own right. (This is for example in stark contrast to Peter van Roy's poster and book, which deliberately ignore typing completely.)</p>

<p>A really great resource is the <a href=""http://Lambda-the-Ultimate.Org/"">Lambda the Ultimate</a> weblog (which is actually where <em>I</em> got introduced to pretty much all of the above reading materials.)</p>

<pre>

</pre>
","2988","","<p>The RubyGems manual calls this a
<a href=""http://guides.rubygems.org/patterns#pessimistic_version_constraint"">pessimistic version constraint</a>.</p>

<p>Assume you have specified an n-part version number, e.g. <code>1.3</code> (2-part) or
<code>3.5.6.2</code> (4-part) as the constraint. Then, in order to fulfill the constraint,
a version number must satisfy both of the following conditions</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The first n-1 parts of the version number must be identical to the first n-1
parts of the constraint
(e.g. <code>1.x</code> or <code>3.5.6.x</code> match, but <code>0.x</code> or <code>3.5.7.x</code> don't) <strong>and</strong></p></li>
<li><p>The last part of the version number must be greater than or equal to the last
part of the constraint
(e.g. <code>1.9999</code> and <code>3.5.6.2</code> match, but <code>1.2</code> or <code>3.5.6.1</code> don't).</p></li>
</ol>

<pre>
x_1.x_2.x_3. &hellip; .x_n-2.x_n-1.y, y = x_n
</pre>

<p>The reason this is called a ""pessimistic"" constraint, and also the use case for
it, is that when you just say <code>&gt; x.y.z</code>, you are being optimistic: you assume
that from here on out, until all eternity, the API will never ever change. This
is of course a pretty bold assumption. However, most projects have rules about
when they are allowed to
<a href=""http://guides.rubygems.org/patterns#semantic_versioning"">break backwards compatibility</a>,
and how they have to change their version number when they <em>do</em> break backwards
compatibility. You can encode those version numbering rules using a pessimistic
constraint, and thus you can be sure that your code will always continue to work
(assuming that the author of the other project actually adheres to his own
rules, which unfortunately isn't always the case).</p>

<pre><code>departureDate = gets.chomp.to_i
guest.departure = departureDate
guestStayedDays = departureDate - guest.arrived # Days the guest have stayed 
</code></pre>

<p>I cant seem to figure this out. Is the problem with get.chomp.to_i that it is returning nil? Or is it returning 0? But then again that would not have given me this error. So is it guest that is nil or is it actually the combination guest.arrived that is the problem? Worth mentioning is that arrived is declared in my checkin method where the guest states its arrival date. Is it somehow lost? </p>

<p>Thanks for the answers I will post the checkin method aswell:</p>

"<p>In Ruby, what is the difference between == and ===? The <a href=""http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/"">RDoc</a> says </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Case Equality—For class Object,
  effectively the same as calling #==,
  but typically overridden by
  descendents to provide meaningful
  semantics in case statements.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is <code>#==</code> the same as <code>==</code>? And could you provide an example of when/how this is used in case statements?</p>
","2988","","<p>The two really have nothing to do with each other. In particular, <code>#==</code> is the equality operator and <code>#===</code> has absolutely nothing to with equality. Personally, I find it rather unfortunate that <code>#===</code> looks so similar to <code>#==</code>, uses the equals sign and is often called the <em>case equality operator</em>, <em>triple equals operator</em> or <em>threequals operator</em> when it really has nothing to do with equality.</p>

<p>I call <code>#===</code> the <em>case subsumption operator</em> (it's the best I could come up with, I'm open to suggestions, especially from native English speakers).</p>

<p>The best way to describe <code>a === b</code> is ""if I have a drawer labeled <code>a</code>, does it make sense to put <code>b</code> in it?""</p>

<p>So, for example, <code>Module#===</code> tests whether <code>b.is_a?(a)</code>. If you have <code>Integer === 2</code>, does it make sense to put <code>2</code> in a box labeled <code>Integer</code>? Yes, it does. What about <code>Integer === 'hello'</code>? Obviously not.</p>

<p>Another example is <code>Regexp#===</code>. It tests for a match. Does it make sense to put <code>'hello'</code> in a box labeled <code>/el+/</code>? Yes, it does.</p>

<p>For collections such as ranges, <code>Range#===</code> is defined as a membership test: it makes sense to put an element in a box labeled with a collection if that element is in the collection.</p>

<p>So, that's what <code>#===</code> does: it tests whether the argument can be subsumed under the receiver.</p>

<p>What does that have to with <code>case</code> expressions? Simple:</p>

  baz

Many JVMs, in turn, map JVM threads to OS threads. And again: if the OS isn't capable of running threads in parallel, there's nothing the JVM can do.

"<p>As with most new technologies after a while a standard emerges.</p>

<p>Is there anything cooking for NoSQL?</p>
","2988","","<p>The <em>whole point</em> of NoSQL is that <em>there are no standard solutions</em>. Every data storage problem is different, and you need to choose the data storage technology that is appropriate for <em>your</em> specific problem and <em>not</em> the one that is ""the standard"".</p>

<p>That's the whole premise of ""<em>Not Only SQL</em>"".</p>

<p>Take ACID (here's a pieve of advice you never thought you'd get on StackOverflow, or really anywhere after 1987 :-) ), for example. There is a wide array of problems which don't need ACID guarantees. For those problems, ACID is overkill. Overkill that translates into wasted I/O, wasted CPU cycles, wasted performance. Which means wasted heat and wasted energy, which in turn means wasted money on electrical and utility bills.</p>

<p>Some problems only need weaker forms of those guarantees. For example, for a wide array of web applications the so-called <em>eventual consistency</em> is plenty enough. Other problems need <em>higher</em> guarantees than what SQL-style ACID provides.</p>

<p>So, some NoSQL databases don't have ACID guarantees or only have them in a weaker form. Some can turn them on and off on a per-DB basis. Some can turn A, C, I and D on and off <em>individually</em> on a per-DB basis. Some can not only turn A, C, I and D <em>on and off</em> individually, they can finetune them on a sliding scale. Some can even do that on a per-<em>query</em> basis.</p>

If you have semi-structured document data, store it in a document database. If you have semantic RDF data, store it in a triple database. If you build a data warehouse, store it in a column database.

"<p>I'm looking for examples of why it's not a good idea to extend base classes in ruby. I need to show some people why it's a weapon to be wielded carefully.</p>

<p>Any horror stories you can share?</p>
","2988","","<p>There was a pretty famous example of <a href=""http://Blog.BrightRedGlow.Com/2008/1/17/evil-can-be-dangerous/"" rel=""nofollow"">monkey-patching going horribly wrong</a> about 2.5 years ago in Rubinius.</p>

<p>The interesting thing about this case is that both the offending code and the victim were highly visible and highly unusual. Usually, the offender is some piece of code written by some PHP script kiddy who got drunk on his 1337 metaprogramming h4X0r skillz. And the failure mode is a simple <code>ArgumentError</code> exception, because the original method and the monkeypatch have different arity.</p>

<p>However, in this case, the offender was a library in the stdlib (<code>mathn</code>) and the failure mode was the Rubinius VM completely blowing up.</p>

<p>So, what happened? Well, <code>mathn</code> monkeypatches the <code>Fixnum</code> class and changes how <code>Fixnum</code> arithmetic works. In particular, it changes both the <em>results</em> and the <em>types</em> of several core methods. E.g.:</p>

<pre><code>r = 4/3  # =&gt; 1
r.class  # =&gt; Fixnum

require 'mathn'

r = 4/3  # =&gt; (4/3)
r.class  # =&gt; Rational
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is of course that in Rubinius, the entire Ruby compiler, the entire Ruby kernel, large parts of the Ruby core library, some parts of the Rubinius VM and other parts of the Rubinius infrastructure, are all written in Ruby. And of course, all of those use <code>Fixnum</code> arithmetic all over the place.</p>

<p>The <code>Hash</code> class is written in Ruby and it uses <code>Fixnum</code> arithmetic to compute the size of the hash buckets, compute the hash function and so on. <code>Array</code> is written in Ruby and needs to compute element sizes and array lengths. The FFI library is written in Ruby and needs to compute memory addresses(!) and structure sizes. Many parts of Rubinius assume that they can do some <code>Fixnum</code> arithmetic and then pass the result to some C function as a pointer or <code>int</code>.</p>

<p>And since Ruby doesn't support any kind of selector namespacing or class boxing or similar (although something like that is planned for Ruby 2.0), as soon as some random user code requires the <code>mathn</code> library, all of those pieces just spectacularly explode, because all of a sudden, the result of a <code>Fixnum</code> operation is no longer a <code>Fixnum</code> (which is basically identical to a machine <code>int</code> and can be passed around as such), but a <code>Rational</code> (which is a full-fledged Ruby object).</p>

<p>Basically, what would happen, is that some code would <code>require 'mathn'</code> (or you would type that into IRb), and immediately the VM would just die.</p>

<p>The solution, in this case, was the <em>safe math</em> plugin for the compiler: when the compiler detects that it is compiling the kernel or other core parts of Rubinius, it automatically rewrites calls to <code>Fixnum</code> methods into calls to private immutable copies of those methods. [Note: I think in current versions of Rubinius, the problem is solved in a different way.]</p>

","2988","","<p>Yes, of course. You can mix <code>BleeTest</code> into an object:</p>

","2988","","<p>I'm not knowledgeable enough with the intricacies of .NET's object initialization semantics to answer your direct question. However, here's two tips:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href=""http://Research.Microsoft.Com/projects/pex/"" rel=""nofollow"">Microsoft Research's Pex</a> can automatically generate unit tests that demonstrate exactly under what conditions a contract violation might occur. It uses the same theorem prover and static analyzer as CC does, so it's a fair bet, the two will agree.</li>
<li>Proving contracts is equivalent to solving the Halting Problem, so just because CC can't <em>prove</em> that it cannot ever be <code>null</code>, doesn't mean it isn't true. IOW: CC might just be wrong and you need to help it along with a <code>Contract.Assume</code> (or, if you're feeling confident, <code>Contract.Assert</code>).</li>
</ol>

<p>Interestingly, if you explicitly add the Object Invariant Assertion that <code>strs</code> can never be <code>null</code>, CC <em>is</em> able to prove <em>that</em> and, consequently, can also prove that <code>strs.Add()</code> will never be a null reference:</p>

<pre><code>[ContractInvariantMethod]
private void StrsIsNotNull()
{
    Contract.Invariant(strs != null);
}
</code></pre>

<p>So, I guess my hunch #2 is correct: CC is just simply wrong in this case. (Or more precisely: the encoding of the semantics of C# into the theorem prover is incomplete.)</p>

","2988","","<p>Class methods don't really exist in Ruby, they are just singleton methods of the class object. Singleton methods don't really exist, either, they are just ordinary instance methods of the object's singleton class.</p>

<p>Since you already know how to define instance methods (using <code>Module#define_method</code>), you already know everything you need to know. You just need to call <code>class_eval</code> on <code>C</code>'s singleton class instead of <code>C</code> itself:</p>

"<p>I know the converse is not true, but if my application works using Mono is it guaranteed to work if I switch to the real deal? If not, where can I find a list of caveats?</p>
","2988","","<p>Both Mono and .NET are supersets of the ECMA/ISO CLI family of specifications. However, neither .NET nor Mono are subsets of the other. Both Mono and .NET add features on top of ECMA/ISO CLI, but while Mono implements many of .NET's additions, .NET does not implement any of Mono's additions.</p>

<p>Here's a few examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mono has larger arrays. This is actually <em>not</em> an added feature to the ECMA/ISO CLI specification but an optional one: the specification says that array indices must be either 32 bit or 64 bit. .NET chose 32 bit but Mono chose 64, since arrays with 10 billion entries and more are quite common in supercomputing applications, where Mono has quite a strong market share. So, if your app has an array with several billions of entries, it will run just fine on Mono but won't work on .NET.</li>
<li>Mono has continuations built into the VM. These are important for game programming.</li>
<li>Mono has native SIMD support for parallel operations on arrays, which are mapped to native CPU SIMD instructions (MMX, SSE, VMX).</li>
<li>Mono has compiler-as-a-service, which Microsoft has been only vaguely talking about for some unspecified future version of .NET.</li>
<li>Mono has a lot of additional libraries, especially bindings to graphics libraries other than Windows Forms (wx.NET, Gtk#, Cocoa#, ...)</li>
</ul>

<p>Note, however, that (except for the arrays), all of these are clearly distinguishible by their namespaces, since none of them live in the <code>System</code> or <code>Microsoft</code> namespaces.</p>

<hr>

<p>EDIT: Actually, most of the above-mentioned extensions are explicitly designed to also work on .NET. For example, <code>Mono.Simd</code> also runs on .NET, but without the runtime support that the Mono VM has, it's unusably slow. (Basically, all the SIMD operations are implemented in C#, but the Mono compiler detects those calls and replaces them with their corresponding assembly instructions. That way, they work on .NET, but without the special treatment, they are significantly slower.) Also, the C# REPL is currently being re-implemented on top of <code>Reflection.Emit</code> (at the moment, it calls the Mono compiler directly), so that it will work on .NET in the future. Gtk# works just fine on Windows and .NET.</p>

<p>Only the <code>Mono.Tasklet</code> library cannot be implemented on .NET, since it requires VM-level support for continuations.</p>

","2988","","<p>Ruby has a uniform iteration interface. All collections in Ruby have a method called <code>each</code>, which allows you to iterate over each element of the collection.

"<p>I'm new to Ruby (experienced with Python, C++ and C). I need to create a class that is only to be used by other classes and methods in a module. In Python, I'd just call it __classname. I'd use an empty typedef in C++. How do I do this in Ruby (or am I barking up the wrong tree and not doing this the ""Ruby way""?)</p>
","2988","","<p>The most important thing to realize is that a class is nothing special. It's just an object. Per convention, classes are assigned to constants, but there is nothing that says they <em>have</em> to be.</p>

<p>And since classes are just objects like any other object, you make them private the same way that you make any other object private.</p>

<p>Here are the possibilities I can think of, in the order of increasing privateness:</p>

<ol>
<li>Just nest them inside a namespace (i.e. module). In Ruby, it is generally expected that all of a library's modules and classes live inside a namespace with the same name as the library (i.e. <code>my_awesome_library</code> &rarr; <code>MyAwesomeLibrary</code>), but in general, everything which is nested below that namespace, is considered private. In fact, besides <code>Test::Unit::TestCase</code>, I cannot think of a single example of a three-level deep namespace that is actually expected to be used by client code.</li>
<li>same as 1., but name it something obvious, like <code>MyAwesomeLibrary::Internal::FfiStruct</code></li>
<li>same as 1. or 2., and mark it with the <code>:nodoc:</code> RDoc tag.</li>
<li>similar to 3., but use a more modern documentation system like YARD, which actually lets you explicitly mark up private APIs.</li>
<li>Use a method instead of a constant. Methods can be made private. (For consistency's sake, you can have the method name start with an uppercase letter, to make it resemble a constant. There's nothing to prevent that, the <code>snake_case</code> convention is just that: a convention.)</li>
<li>Use an instance variable. They are always private. Note that both private methods and instance variables can be trivially accessed using reflection. <code>send</code> seems to be in more widespread use than <code>instance_variable_get</code>, though, which is why I consider instance variables to have a higher level of privacy than methods.</li>
<li>Really the only way to get actual privacy or encapsulation is using local variables and closures, though. Note however that this might preclude you from using Ruby's module, class or method definition syntax, because those create new scopes. In all cases where you need access to the class, you need to use <code>Module.new</code>, <code>Class.new</code> or <code>Module#define_method</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Ex.:</p>

<pre><code>module MyAwesomeLibrary
  struct = Class.new(FFI::Struct) do
    # ...
  end

  PublicInterface = Class.new do
    define_method(:initialize) do |bar|
      @foo = struct.new(bar)
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>And yes, this is the <em>only</em> way of achieving true 100% information hiding and encapsulation in Ruby.</p>

<p>However, the normal Ruby way would be to simply document the stuff as being private (maybe push it down a level of namespacing) and trust your fellow developers. In the Ruby community, this is sometimes summarized under the Python slogan ""We are all consenting adults"".</p>
"
"<p>I was reading a Ruby question about the <code>.each</code> iterator, and someone stated that using <code>.each</code> can be a code smell if higher order iterators are better suited for the task. What are higher order iterators in Ruby?</p>

<p><strong>edit:</strong> Jörg W Mittag, the author of the StackOverflow answer that I was referring to mentioned that he meant to write higher <em>level</em> iterators, but he also explained what they are very well below.</p>
","2988","","<p>Oops. I meant higher-<em>level</em> iterators, not higher-<em>order</em>. <em>Every</em> iterator is of course by definition higher-order.</p>

<p>Basically, iteration is a very low-level concept. The purpose of programming is to communicate intent to the other stakeholders on the team. ""Initializing an empty array, then iterating over another array and adding the current element of this array to the first array if it is divisible by two without a remainder"" is <em>not</em> communicating intent. ""Selecting all even numbers"" <em>is</em>.</p>

<p>In general, you almost never iterate over a collection just for iteration's sake. You either want to</p>

<ul>
<li>transform each element in some way (that's usually called <code>map</code>, in Ruby and Smalltalk it's <code>collect</code> and in .NET and SQL it's <code>Select</code>),</li>
<li>reduce the whole collection down to some single value, e.g. computing the sum or the average or the standard deviation of a list of football scores (in category theory, that's called a <em>catamorphism</em>, in functional programming it is <code>fold</code> or <code>reduce</code>, in Smalltalk it's <code>inject:into:</code>, in Ruby it's <code>inject</code> and in .NET <code>Aggregate</code>),</li>
<li>filter out all elements that satisfy a certain condition (<code>filter</code> in most functional languages, <code>select</code> in Smalltalk and Ruby, also <code>find_all</code> in Ruby, <code>Where</code> in .NET and SQL),</li>
<li>filter out all elements that <em>do not</em> satisfy a condition (<code>reject</code> in Smalltalk and Ruby)</li>
<li>find the first element that satisfies a condition (<code>find</code> in Ruby)</li>
<li>count the elements thats satisfy a condition (<code>count</code> in Ruby)</li>
<li>check if all elements (<code>all?</code>), at least one element (<code>any?</code>) or no elements (<code>none?</code>) satisfy a condition</li>
<li>group the elements into buckets based on some discriminator (<code>group_by</code> in Ruby, .NET and SQL)</li>
<li>partition the collection into two collections based on some predicate (<code>partition</code>)</li>
<li>sort the collection (<code>sort</code>, <code>sort_by</code>)</li>
<li>combine multiple collections into one (<code>zip</code>)</li>
<li>and so on and so forth &hellip;</li>
</ul>

<p>Almost <em>never</em> is your goal to just iterate over a collection.</p>

<p>In particular, <code>reduce</code> aka. <code>inject</code> aka. <code>fold</code> aka. <code>inject:into:</code> aka. <code>Aggregate</code> aka. <em>catamorphism</em> is your friend. There's a reason why it has such a fancy-sounding mathematical name: it is extremely powerful. In fact, most of what I mentioned above, can be implemented in terms of <code>reduce</code>.</p>

<p>Basically, what <code>reduce</code> does, is it ""reduces"" the entire collection down to a single value, using some function. You have some sort of accumulator value, and then you take the accumulator value and the first element and feed it into the function. The result of that function then becomes the new accumulator, which you pair up with the second element and feed to the function and so on.</p>

<p>The most obvious example of this is summing a list of numbers:</p>

<pre><code>[4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42].reduce(0) {|acc, elem|
  acc + elem
}
</code></pre>

<p>So, the accumulator starts out as <code>0</code>, and we pass the first element <code>4</code> into the <code>+</code> function. The result is <code>4</code>, which becomes the new accumulator. Now we pass the next element <code>8</code> in and the result is <code>12</code>. And this continues till the last element and the result is that they were dead the whole time. No, wait, the result is <code>108</code>.</p>

<p>Ruby actually allows us to take a couple of shortcuts: If the element type is the same as the accumulator type, you can leave out the accumulator and Ruby will simply pass the first element as the first value for the accumulator:</p>

<pre><code>[4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42].reduce {|acc, elem|
  acc + elem
}
</code></pre>

<p>Also, we can use <code>Symbol#to_proc</code> here:</p>

<pre><code>[4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42].reduce(&amp;:+)
</code></pre>

<p>And actually, if you pass <code>reduce</code> a <code>Symbol</code> argument it will treat as the name of the function to use for the reduction operation:</p>

<pre><code>[4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42].reduce(:+)
</code></pre>

<p>However, summing is not all that <code>reduce</code> can do. In fact, I find this example a little dangerous. Everybody I showed this to, immediately understood, ""Aah, so <em>that's</em> what a <code>reduce</code> is"", but unortunately some also thought that summing numbers is <em>all</em> <code>reduce</code> is, and that's definitely not the case. In fact, <code>reduce</code> is a <em>general method of iteration</em>, by which I mean that <code>reduce</code> can do <em>anything</em> that <code>each</code> can do. In particular, you can store arbitrary state in the accumulator.</p>

<p>For example, I wrote above that <code>reduce</code> reduces the collection down to a single value. But of course that ""single value"" can be arbitrarily complex. It could, for example, be itself a collection. Or a string:</p>

<pre><code>class Array
  def mystery_method(foo)
    drop(1).reduce(""#{first}"") {|s, el| s &lt;&lt; foo.to_str &lt;&lt; el.to_s }
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>This is an example how far you can go with playing tricks with the accumulator. If you try it out, you'll of course recognize it as <code>Array#join</code>:</p>

<pre><code>class Array
  def join(sep=$,)
    drop(1).reduce(""#{first}"") {|s, el| s &lt;&lt; sep.to_str &lt;&lt; el.to_s }
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Note that nowhere in this ""loop"" do I have to keep track of whether I'm at the last or second-to-last element. Nor is there any conditional in the code. There is no potential for fencepost errors here. If you think about how to implement this with <code>each</code>, you <em>would</em> have to somehow keep track of the index and check whether you are at the last element and then have an <code>if</code> in there, to prevent emitting the separator at the end.</p>

<p>Since I wrote above that all iteration can be done with <code>reduce</code>, I might just as well prove it. Here's Ruby's <code>Enumerable</code> methods, implemented in terms of <code>reduce</code> instead of <code>each</code> as they normally are. (Note that I only just started and have only arrived at <em>g</em> yet.)</p>

<pre><code>module Enumerable
  def all?
    reduce(true) {|res, el| res &amp;&amp; yield(el) }
  end

  def any?

  def count
    reduce(0) {|res, el| res + 1 if yield el }

<p>[Note: I made some simplifications for the purpose of this post. For example, according to the standard Ruby Enumerable protocol, <code>each</code> is supposed to return <code>self</code>, so you'd have to slap an extra line in there; other methods behave slightly differently, depending on what kind and how many arguments you pass in and so on. I left those out because they distract from the point I am trying to make.]</p>

","2988","","<p>I think you are a little bit confused. In the question, you ask how to turn a JSON <em>document</em> into classes. In the comments, you say you want a JSON version of the RXSD XML tool, which however, turns XML <em>schemas</em> into Ruby classes.</p>

<p>Turning JSON documents into classes doesn't really make sense. If you compare the world of document markup to programming, documents correspond to objects and schemas correspond to classes (well, types, actually, but since we're talking about Ruby, let's not open that can of worms and stick with classes).</p>

<p>So, it makes sense to generate Ruby objects from JSON documents and it makes sense to generate Ruby classes from JSON schemas, but it doesn't make sense to generate Ruby classes from JSON documents. The bad news is of course that in order to be able to automatically generate Ruby classes from JSON schema is that in order for that to work, the JSON schema has to be in an automatically processable (IOW machine-readable) format.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there is no such thing as a <em>JSON schema</em>, and thus JSON schemas tend to generally not be machine-readable, but rather are just a blurb of human-oriented English text on the API documentation page of the web service provider. If you're lucky. More often than not, there is no documentation <em>at all</em> about the JSON schema.</p>

<p>So, since there is no standardized way of describing JSON schemas, there cannot be a standardized tool for processing JSON schemas. Unlike XML, where there is a limited number of standardized schemas (DTD, XSD, RelaxNG).</p>

<p>Note that what I wrote above is not strictly true: there <em>are</em> specifications for JSON schemas (e.g. <a href=""http://JSON-Schema.Org/"" rel=""nofollow"">JSON-Schema</a>) and there are Ruby implementations of those (e.g. <a href=""https://GitHub.Com/Constellation/Ruby-JSONchema/"" rel=""nofollow"">Ruby/JSONSchema</a>, validation only, doesn't generate classes), but nobody is using them, so they might just as well not exist.</p>

","2988","","<p>Both, actually.</p>

<p>Your application <em>is</em> a web application, but it doesn't run on the internet, it runs on a small webserver that is part of your application inside the phone. It also doesn't run in the browser, but rather in a native browser widget inside your application.</p>

<p>Since the webserver runs on the phone itself, it has access to all the native capabilities of the phone, so you can make HTTP calls to the webserver to capture sound from the microphone, shoot video with the camera, get the GPS location, get multitouch info and so on.</p>

"<p>I'm currently trying to learn Ruby and I'm trying to understand more about what it offers in terms of encapsulation and contracts.</p>

<p>In C# a contract can be defined using an interface. A class which implements the interface must fulfil the terms within the contract by providing an implementation for each method and property (and maybe other things) defined. The individual class that implements an interface can do whatever it needs within the scope of the methods defined by the contract, so long as it accepts the same types of arguments and returns the same type of result.</p>

<p>Is there a way to enforce this kind of thing in Ruby?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

","2988","","<p>Ruby has <em>Interfaces</em> just like any other language.</p>

<p>Note that you have to be careful not to conflate the concept of the <em>Interface</em>, which is an abstract specification of the responsibilities, guarantees and protocols of a unit with the concept of the <code>interface</code> which is a keyword in the Java, C# and VB.NET programming languages. In Ruby, we use the former all the time, but the latter simply doesn't exist.</p>

<p>It is very important to distinguish the two. What's important is the <em>Interface</em>, not the <code>interface</code>. The <code>interface</code> tells you pretty much nothing useful. Nothing demonstrates this better than the <em>marker interfaces</em> in Java, which are interfaces that have no members at all: just take a look at <a href=""http://Download.Oracle.Com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/Serializable.html""><code>java.io.Serializable</code></a> and <a href=""http://Download.Oracle.Com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Cloneable.html""><code>java.lang.Cloneable</code></a>; those two <code>interface</code>s mean <em>very</em> different things, yet they have the <em>exact same</em> signature.</p>

<p>So, if two <code>interface</code>s that mean different things, have the same signature, what <em>exactly</em> is the <code>interface</code> even guaranteeing you?</p>

<p>Another good example:</p>

<pre><code>interface ICollection&lt;T&gt;: IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;, IEnumerable
{
    void Add(T item);
}
</code></pre>

<p>What is the <em>Interface</em> of <a href=""http://MSDN.Microsoft.Com/library/63ywd54z.aspx""><code>System.Collections.Generic.ICollection&lt;T&gt;.Add</code></a>?</p>

<ul>
<li>that the length of the collection does not decrease</li>
<li>that all the items that were in the collection before are still there</li>
<li>that <code>item</code> is in the collection</li>
</ul>

<p>And which of those actually shows up in the <code>interface</code>? None! There is nothing in the <code>interface</code> that says that the <code>Add</code> method must even <em>add</em> at all, it might just as well <em>remove</em> an element from the collection.</p>

<p>This is a perfectly valid implementation of that <code>interface</code>:</p>

<pre><code>class MyCollection&lt;T&gt;: ICollection&lt;T&gt;
{
    void Add(T item)
    {
        Remove(item);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Another example: where in <a href=""http://Download.Oracle.Com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Set.html""><code>java.util.Set&lt;E&gt;</code></a> does it actually say that it is, you know, a <em>set</em>? Nowhere! Or more precisely, in the documentation. In English.</p>

<p>In pretty much all cases of <code>interfaces</code>, both from Java and .NET, all the <em>relevant</em> information is actually in the docs, not in the types. So, if the types don't tell you anything interesting anyway, why keep them at all? Why not stick just to documentation? And that's exactly what Ruby does.</p>

<p>Note that there are <em>other</em> languages in which the <em>Interface</em> can actually be described in a meaningful way. However, those languages typically don't call the construct which describes the <em>Interface</em> ""<code>interface</code>"", they call it <code>type</code>. In a dependently-typed programming language, you can for example express the properties that a <code>sort</code> function returns a collection of the same length as the original, that every element which is in the original is also in the sorted collection and that no bigger element appears before a smaller element.</p>

<p>So, in short: Ruby does not have an equivalent to a Java <code>interface</code>. It <em>does</em> however have an equivalent to a Java <em>Interface</em>, and its exactly the same as in Java: documentation.</p>

<p>Also, just like in Java, <em>Acceptance Tests</em> can be used to specify *Interface*s as well.</p>

<p>In particular, in Ruby, the <em>Interface</em> of an object is determined by what it can <em>do</em>, not what <code>class</code> is is, or what <code>module</code> it mixes in. Any object that has a <code>&lt;&lt;</code> method can be appended to. This is very useful in unit tests, where you can simply pass in an <code>Array</code> or a <code>String</code> instead of a more complicated <code>Logger</code>, even though <code>Array</code> and <code>Logger</code> do not share an explicit <code>interface</code> apart from the fact that they both have a method called <code>&lt;&lt;</code>.</p>

<p>Another example is <a href=""http://RubyDoc.Info/docs/ruby-stdlib/1.9.2/StringIO/""><code>StringIO</code></a>, which implements the same <em>Interface</em> as <code>IO</code> and thus a large portion of the <em>Interface</em> of <code>File</code>, but without sharing any common ancestor besides <code>Object</code>.</p>

","2988","","<p>If you want to print an integer to stdout, you need to convert it to a string first, since that's all stdout understands. If you want to print two integers to stdout, you need to convert both of them to a string first. If you want to print three integers to stdout, you need to convert all three of them to a string first. If you want to print one billion integers to stdout, you need to convert all one billion of them to a string first.</p>

<p>There's nothing you, we, or Ruby, or really any programming language can do about that.</p>

<p>You could try interleaving the conversion with the I/O by doing a lazy stream implementation. You could try to do the conversion and the I/O in parallel, by doing a lazy stream implementation and separating the conversion and the I/O into two separate threads. (Be sure to use a Ruby implementation which can actually <em>execute</em> parallel threads, not all of them can: MRI, YARV and Rubinius can't, for example.)</p>

<p>You can parallelize the conversion, by converting separate chunks in the array in separate threads in parallel. You can even buy a billion core machine and convert all billion integers at the same time in parallel.</p>

<p>But even then, the fact of the matter remains: every single integer needs to be converted. Whether you do that one after the other first, and then print them or do it one after the other interleaved with the I/O or do it one after the other in parallel with the I/O or even convert all of them at the same time on a billion core CPU: the number of needed conversions does not magically decrease. A large number of integers means a large number of conversions. Even if you do all billion conversions in a billion core CPU in parallel, it's <em>still</em> a billion conversions, i.e. a billion calls to <code>to_s</code>.</p>

","2988","","<p>You have discovered the fundamental difference between a text editor and an IDE: a text editor edits <em>text</em> (duh!), i.e. an unstructured stream of characters. It doesn't know anything about objects, messages, methods, mixins, modules, classes, namespaces, types, strings, arrays, hashes, numbers, literals etc. This is great, because it means that you can edit <em>anything</em> with a text editor, but it also means that editing any <em>particular</em> thing is harder than it were with a specialized editor.</p>

<p>A Ruby IDE edits <em>Ruby programs</em>, i.e. a highly structured semantic graph of objects, methods, classes etc. This is great, because the IDE knows about the rules that make up legal Ruby programs and thus will e.g. make it impossible for you to write illegal Ruby programs and it can offer you automated transformations that <em>guarantee</em> that if you start out with a legal Ruby program, you end up with a legal Ruby program (e.g. automated refactorings). But it also means that you can <em>only</em> edit Ruby programs.</p>

<p>In short: it's simply impossible to do what you ask with a text editor. You need an IDE. (Note: you <em>can</em> of course build an IDE on top of a text editor. Emacs is a good example of this. But from what I have read, the TextMate plugin API is simply not powerful enough to do this. I could be wrong, though&nbsp;&ndash; since I don't have a Mac, I'm mostly dependent on hearsay.)</p>

"<p>I have some existing ruby classes in a app/classes folder:</p>

<pre><code>class A
   ...
end

class B
   ...
end
</code></pre>

<p>I'd like to group those classes in a module MyModule</p>

<p>I know I could do like:</p>

<pre><code>module MyModule
  class A
      ...
   end
   class B
      ...
   end
end
</code></pre>

<p>but is there a meta programming shortcut that could do the same so I could ""import"" all the existing classes ?</p>

<p>Thanks,
Luc</p>
","2988","","<p>@Squeegy's answer already tells you what to do, but I think it is equally important to understand <em>why</em> that works. And it's actually pretty simple: classes in Ruby are nothing special. They are just objects like any other object that get assigned to variables just like any other variable. More precisely: they are instances of the <code>Class</code> class and they usually get assigned to constants (i.e. variables whose name starts with an uppercase letter).</p>

<p>So, just like you can alias any <em>other</em> object to multiple variables:</p>

<pre><code>a = ''
b = a
a &lt;&lt; 'Hello'
c = b
b &lt;&lt; ', World!'
puts c # =&gt; Hello, World!
</code></pre>

<p>You can also alias classes to multiple variables:</p>

<pre><code>class Foo; end
bar = Foo
p bar.new # =&gt; #&lt;Foo:0x1d9f220&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to <em>move</em> the classes into the namespace instead of just aliasing them, you also need to set the original variables to some other object like <code>nil</code>, in addition to @Squeegy's answer:</p>

<pre><code>::A = nil
::B = nil
</code></pre>

"<p>I need an algorithm that introduces data like a stack, so when I scan the structure I can read them in the same sequence as they were introduced, for sequential access. Also these values are stored in buckets, like a hashtable, so I can fragment the whole structure for disk storage and have fast random access.</p>

<p>Is there an algorithm like this, or should I have two separate structures? What's the best strategy?</p>

<p>Best regards!</p>
","2988","","<p>This would be something like an Ordered Map, right? Those are usually implemented by combining a linked list with whatever you want to use to implement a map (e.g. a hash table).</p>

<p>In Ruby 1.9, the specification of the <code>Hash</code> class (which is confusingly how Ruby spells ""Map"") was changed such that it preserves insertion order. Most Ruby 1.9 implementations I know implemented this as some sort of combination of a list and a hash table. Rubinius's implementation is especially easy to read, since it is written 100% in Ruby: <a href=""https://GitHub.Com/EvanPhx/Rubinius/blob/master/kernel/common/hash.rb"" rel=""nofollow""><code>kernel/common/hash.rb</code></a></p>

<p>Java has an implementation of an ordered map, called <code>LinkedHashMap</code>. Here's the source from Oracle OpenJDK 7: <a href=""http://Hg.OpenJDK.Java.Net/jdk7/tl/jdk/file/default/src/share/classes/java/util/LinkedHashMap.java"" rel=""nofollow""><code>/share/classes/java/util/LinkedHashMap.java</code></a></p>

<p>Apache Commons Collections has an <code>OrderedMap</code> interface and two implementations: <a href=""http://SVN.Apache.Org/viewvc/commons/proper/collections/trunk/src/java/org/apache/commons/collections/map/LinkedMap.java?view=markup"" rel=""nofollow""><code>LinkedMap</code></a> and <a href=""http://SVN.Apache.Org/viewvc/commons/proper/collections/trunk/src/java/org/apache/commons/collections/map/ListOrderedMap.java?view=markup"" rel=""nofollow""><code>ListOrderedMap</code></a>.</p>

<p>If you are a little bit careful, you should be able to preserve the asymptotic complexity guarantees of an unordered map.</p>

"<p>What is the theoretical/practical limit to the recursion depth in languages implementing Tail Call optimisation? (Please assume that the recurring function is properly tail call-ed).</p>

<p>My guess is that the theoretical limit is NONE, as there is no recursive process, even though it is recursive procedure. Practical limit would be that allowed by the main memory available to be used. Please clarify or correct if I am wrong somewhere.</p>
","2988","","<p>In addition to what @Mehrdad Afshari wrote, I just want to point out that it is actually very important that tail recursion (or more generally a chain of tail calls) can be potentially infinite, because otherwise you couldn't write a web server, an operating system, an interpreter, a REPL, or really any kind of event processing loop in a functional language.</p>

<p>After all, an operating system is nothing but an infinite loop, and the way to write a loop in a functional language is using tail recursion. If tail recursion weren't infinite, the loop wouldn't be infinite. Therefore, you could not only not write an operating system, the language wouldn't even be Turing-complete.</p>

<p>Basically, this is how you write a web server in a functional language:</p>

<pre><code>def loop(queue) = {
  // handle first request in queue
  loop(queue)
}
</code></pre>

<p>Without infinite tail recursion, this would quickly run out of memory.</p>
"
"<p>In terms of scope? Actual implementation in memory? The syntax? For eg, if (let a 1) Is 'a' a variable or a symbol? </p>
","2988","","<p>A <em>symbol</em> is a name for a thing. A <em>variable</em> is a mutable pointer to a mutable storage location.</p>

<p>In the code snippet you showed, both <code>let</code> and <code>a</code> are symbols. Within the scope of the <code>let</code> block, the symbol <code>a</code> denotes a variable which is currently bound to the value <code>1</code>.</p>

<p>But the name of the thing is not the thing itself. The symbol <code>a</code> is not a variable. It is a <em>name</em> for a variable. But <em>only</em> in this specific context. In a different context, the name <code>a</code> can refer to a completely different thing.</p>

<p>Example: the symbol <code>jaguar</code> may, depending on context, denote</p>

"<p>I'm trying to get a sense of the similarities between languages in syntax. How similar are Python, jQuery and C? I started programming in Actionscript 3 and then moved on to Javascript , then went on and learned Prototype, and then I started using jQuery and found that the syntax is very different. So is jQuery more like C and Python?</p>
","2988","","<p>For jQuery, the answer is pretty simple: jQuery isn't a language, therefore it doesn't have syntax.</p>

<p>For Python and C, the answer from a high-level point of view is also very simple: Python's syntax is directly inspired by C's syntax. (Or more precisely, both Python's and C's syntax are inspired by ALGOL's syntax.) There is really only one significant difference from a high-level point of view: C uses opening and closing curly braces to delimit blocks, Python uses indentation.</p>

<p>Otherwise, the two high-level syntaxes are almost the same: both have unary and binary operators, even with similar precedence (unline Smalltalk, for example, which doesn't have operators), both distinguish between statements and expressions (unlike Ruby, for example, which doesn't have statements), both use semicolons between statements (although technically, the semicolon is a statement <em>terminator</em> in C and a statement <em>separator</em> in Python), both use similar syntax for numeric literals and string literals as well as array/list indexing.</p>

<p>There are a couple of syntactic differences related to the different semantics: in Python, variables are untyped (only objects are typed), so there is no type annotation syntax for variable declarations (in fact, there is no syntax for variable declarations <em>at all</em>). There <em>is</em> syntax for type annotations of function parameters and function return values, but in Python the types come <em>after</em> the parameter name, and the type annotations are optional. With variables being untyped, the concept of <em>type casting</em> doesn't make sense, so there is no syntax for that. Neither is there any pointer-related syntax, since Python doesn't have those.</p>

<p>Python has a couple more literals than C: lists, sets, dictionaries, in particular. However, they follow in the C tradition: in C, an array is declared and indexed using square brackets, so Python uses square brackets for array literals.</p>

"<p>I am from Java world and I wonder what is so great about dynamic typing in Python besides missing errors while compiling the code?</p>

<p>Do you like Python's typing? Do you have an example where it helped in a big project? Isn't it a bit error prone?</p>
","2988","","<p>Static type checking is undecidable in the general case. This means that there are programs which are statically type-safe but for which the type-checker cannot <em>prove</em> that they are statically type-safe, and thus the type-checker must reject those programs.</p>

<p>In other words: there are type-safe programs that the type-checker will not allow you to write. Or, even more succinctly: static typing prevents you from writing certain programs.</p>

<p>This applies to <em>all</em> static typing in general, not just to Java.</p>

<p>As to Java specifically: it has a rather crappy type system. Its type system is not expressive enough to express even <em>very</em> simple properties. For example: where in the type of <code>static void java.util.Arrays.sort(Object[] a)</code> does it actually say that the result has to be, you know, sorted? Or that the array elements have to be partially ordered?</p>

<p>Another problem with Java is that its type system has holes so big that you can drive a truck through:</p>

<pre><code>String[] a = new String[1];
Object[] b = a;
b[0] = 1; // ArrayStoreException
</code></pre>

<p>The problem in this particular case are covariant arrays. It's simply not possible for arrays to be both covariant and type-safe.</p>

<p>Java combines all the hassle of static typing with none of the advantages. So, you might just as well get rid of the hassle.</p>

<p>However, note that this is not universal. There are other languages which have much better type systems for which the trade-offs are much less clear.</p>

<p>For example, here is the most stupid language benchmark of all time (Fibonacci) in Python:</p>

<pre><code>def fib(n):
    if n &lt; 2: return n
    return fib(n-2) + fib(n-1)
</code></pre>

<p>and Java:</p>

<pre><code>int fib(int n) {
    if (n &lt; 2) return n;
    return fib(n-2) + fib(n-1);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that there is quite a bit more clutter there, which is solely related to static typing. To make the comparison more fair, let's imagine a language with Python's syntax and Java's semantics:</p>

<pre><code>def fib(n: int) -&gt; int:
    if n &lt; 2: return n
    return fib(n-2) + fib(n-1)
</code></pre>

<p>[Interesting side note: with the addition of optional static type annotations in Python 3.x, that <em>is</em> actually also valid Python code, although it is obviously still not statically type-safe, since the annotations are just that: annotations. They are never actually checked anywhere.]</p>

<p>There <em>is</em> some definite clutter there. However, in Haskell it looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>fib n
  |     n &lt; 2 = n
  | otherwise = fib (n-2) + fib (n-1)
</code></pre>

<p>Unlike the Python version, this <em>is</em> perfectly statically type-safe, but there is zero type-related clutter.</p>

<p>In this particular case, the question between the benefits of static and dynamic typing are much less clear.</p>

<p>By the way, a more idiomatic Haskell version would probably look like this:</p>

<pre><code>fib 0 = 0
fib 1 = 1
fib n = fib (n-2) + fib (n-1)
</code></pre>

<p>or this:</p>

<pre><code>fibs = 0 : 1 : zipWith (+) fibs (tail fibs)
</code></pre>

<p>Really, the much more important difference between Java and Python is not so much that Java is statically typed and Python is dynamically typed, but rather that Java is just not a good programming language, while Python <em>is</em>. So, Java is just always going to lose, not because it is statically typed, but because it is crap. Comparing BASIC with Haskell, Haskell clearly wins, but again, not because it is statically typed but because BASIC is crap.</p>

<p>A much more interesting comparison would be Java vs. BASIC or Python vs. Haskell.</p>

"<p>I'm wondering, what's the origin of asking interviewees to manually parse a string as an int? (without relying on any casting/type-conversion that may be built into the language).  Is this a standard question, suggested from a book or list or something?  </p>

        mult *= 10;
    }

    return intValue;
}
</code></pre>
","2988","","<p>I haven't been asked this question, either.</p>

<p>At first glance, it seems like one of those ""weed the obviously incompetent idiots out as early as possible to avaid wasting valuable interview time"" type of questions.</p>

<p>But if you look at it more closely, there's actually some quite interesting stuff in there. So, if <em>I</em> were the one <em>asking</em> that question, here's what I would be looking for:</p>

<ul>
<li>That question is obviously stupid, because there already <em>is</em> a function in the ECMAScript standard library that does exactly that. And I would want the interviewee to <em>tell</em> me that the question is stupid, because otherwise they are either a) mindless zombies that stupidly follow braindead orders instead of engaging their brain, or b) they don't actually <em>know</em> that that function exists.</li>
<li>It's also obviously a parsing problem, and it is interesting to see whether the interviewee approaches it as more of a string hacking problem or a formal parsing problem and how much overhead either approach generates. In this particular case, I believe that string hacking is the right approach, but it still leads into a great followup question: ""Now do the same thing with a recursive-descent parser"". Any programmer should be able to sketch out the recursive-descent parser for this problem within a couple of minutes.</li>
<li>Last but not least, this is obviously a fold over the characters of the string. Now, I would not necessarily expect a novice programmer to spot this fold on their own right away, but if I hint that there is a fold in there, they should be able to spot it themselves, and rewrite their solution in form of a fold.</li>
<li>And of course, you can judge all the general qualities that this type of question allows you to: does the interviewee stop and think about the problem or does he start hacking away. Does he start with requirements, documentation, specification, examples, tests, or code. Does he ask for clarification of the corner cases (like what happens with the empty string, what happens with a string that only contains a minus sign and nothing else, what about whitespace, are strings guaranteed to be well-formed integers, is negative zero a well-formed integer). Does he habitually use the strict subset of ES5. Does he write readable code. Does he write <code>jslint</code>-friendly code</li>
</ul>

<p>Here's an example of solving the problem with a fold (which in ECMAScript is called <code>reduce</code>):</p>

<pre><code>""use strict"";

function toInteger(s) {
    return s.split('').reverse().reduce(function (n, c, i) {
        if (c === '-') return -n;
        return n + (c.charCodeAt(0) - 48) * Math.pow(10, i);
    }, 0);
}
</code></pre>

<p>And this is a simple recursive-descent parser which builds up the value on the fly:</p>

<pre><code>""use strict"";

function toInteger(s) {
    var input,
        output = 0,
        sign = 1,

        lookahead = function () {
            return input.charAt(0);
        },

        consume = function () {
            var res = input.slice(0, 1);
            input = input.slice(1, input.length);
            return res;
        },

        isDigit = function (c) {
            return /[0-9]/.test(c);
        },

        signParser = function () {
            if (lookahead() === '-') {
                sign *= -1;
                consume();
            }
        },

        digitParser = function () {
            if (!isDigit(lookahead())) return false;
            output *= 10;
            output += (consume().charCodeAt(0) - 48);
            return true;
        },

        numberParser = function () {
            signParser();
            while (digitParser());
        };

    input = s;
    numberParser();
    if (!input.length === 0) return false;
    output *= sign;

    return output;
}
</code></pre>

<p>As is always the case with this kind of interview questions, nobody would seriously expect the interviewee to just write those functions down on the whiteboard. Especially the recursive-descent parser. But IMHO, anybody <em>should</em> be able to sketch out what the function would look like. In particular, one of the beauties of a recursive-descent parser is that it is a very direct transformation of a context-free grammar into a set of parsing functions, and an interviewee should be able to explain roughly how that transformation works, and what kind of parsing functions correspond to what kind of grammar constructs.</p>

<p>If you use the mswin32 port, you are more or less on your own. In particular, you <em>must</em> use Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0, because that's what the mswin32 port is compiled with, and later versions of Visual C++ are not guaranteed to be binary compatible.

Try forcing the platform by explicitly calling <code>gem install --platform=mswin32 fast-stemmer</code> or even <code>gem install --platform=x86-mswin32-60 fast-stemmer</code>. That way, if the maintainer has provided a pre-compiled version, you don't need to compile it yourself.</p>

<p>So, if constructors are basically factory methods with restrictions, there is really no need to have them both, and thus many languages simply get rid of constructors. Examples include Objective-C, Ruby, Smalltalk, Self, Newspeak, ECMAScript/JavaScript, Io, Ioke, Seph and many others.</p>

<p>In Ruby, the closest thing to a constructor is the method <a href=""http://RDoc.Info/docs/ruby-core/1.9.2/Class#allocate-instance_method"" rel=""nofollow""><code>Class#allocate</code></a>, which simply allocates an empty object and sets that object's class pointer. Nothing more. Since such an empty object is obviously unusable, it needs to initialized. Per convention, this initialization is performed by <code>#initialize</code>. As a convenience, because it is cumbersome to always have to remember to both allocate and initialize (as any Objective-C developer can probably attest), there is a helper method called <code>Class#new</code>, which looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>class Class
  def new(*args, &amp;block)
    obj = allocate
    obj.initialize(*args, &amp;block)

    return obj
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>This allows you to replace this:</p>

<pre><code>foo = Foo.allocate
foo.initialize(bar)
</code></pre>

<p>With this:</p>

<pre><code>foo = Foo.new(bar)
</code></pre>

<p>It is important to note that there is nothing special about any of these methods. Well, with one exception: <code>Class#allocate</code> obviously has to be able to set the class pointer and to allocate memory, which is something that is not possible in Ruby. So, this method has to somehow come from outside the system, which e.g. in MRI means that it is written in C, not Ruby. But that only concerns the implementation. There are no special dispatch rules, no special override rules. It's just a method like any other that can e.g. call <code>super</code> whereever, whenever and how often it wants and can return what it wants.</p>

"<p>Instead of adding the PLinq extension statement AsParallel() manually could not the compiler figure this out for us auto-magically? Are there any examples where you specifically do not  want parallelization if the code supports it?</p>
","2988","","<p>The good news is that the compiler researchers say that we are <em>really</em> close to having automatically parallelizing compilers. The bad news is that they have been saying that for fifty years.</p>

<p>The problem with impure languages such as C# is usually that there is not enough parallelism. In an impure language, it is very hard for a human and pretty much impossible for a program to figure out if and how two pieces of code interact with each other or with the environment.</p>

<p>In a pure, referentially transparent, language, you have the opposite problem: <em>everything</em> is parallelizable, but it usually doesn't make sense, because scheduling a thread takes way longer than just simply executing the damn thing.</p>

<p>For example, in a pure, referentially transparent, functional language, if I have something like this:</p>

<pre><code>if a &lt;= b + c
  foo
else
  bar
end
</code></pre>

<p>I could fire up five threads and compute <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>c</code>, <code>foo</code> and <code>bar</code> in parallel, then I compute the <code>+</code> and then the <code>&lt;=</code> and lastly, I compute the <code>if</code>, which simply means throwing away the result of either <code>foo</code> or <code>bar</code>, which both have already been computed. (Note how this depends on being functional: in an impure language, you cannot simply compute both branches of an <code>if</code> and then throw one away. What if both print something? How would you ""unprint"" that?)</p>

<p>But if <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>c</code>, <code>foo</code> and <code>bar</code> are really cheap, then the overhead of those five threads will be far greater than the computations themselves.</p>

"<p>I'm doing some research on multicore processors; specifically I'm looking at writing code for multicore processors and also compiling code for multicore processors. </p>

<p>I'm curious about the major problems in this field that would currently prevent a widespread adoption of programming techniques and practices to fully leverage the power of multicore architectures.</p>

<p>I am aware of the following efforts (some of these don't seem directly related to multicore architectures, but seem to have more to do with parallel-programming models, multi-threading, and concurrency):</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_%28programming_language%29"" rel=""nofollow"">Erlang</a> (I know that Erlang includes constructs to facilitate concurrency, but I am not sure how exactly it is being leveraged for multicore architectures)</li>
<li><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenMP"" rel=""nofollow"">OpenMP</a> (seems mostly related to multiprocessing and leveraging the power of clusters)</li>
<li><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Parallel_C"" rel=""nofollow"">Unified Parallel C</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cilk"" rel=""nofollow"">Cilk</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Threading_Building_Blocks"" rel=""nofollow"">Intel Threading Blocks</a> (this seems to be directly related to multicore systems; makes sense as it comes from Intel. In addition to defining certain programming-constructs, it also seems have features that tell the compiler to optimize the code for multicore architectures)</li>
</ul>

<p>In general, from what little experience I have with <em>multithreaded</em> programming, I know that programming with concurrency and parallelism in mind is definitely a difficult concept. I am also aware that <em>multithreaded programming</em> and <em>multicore programming</em> are two different things. in multithreaded programming you are ensuring that the CPU does not remain idle (on a single-CPU system. As James pointed out the OS can schedule different threads to run on different cores -- but I'm more interested in describing the parallel operations from the language itself, or via the compiler). As far as I know you cannot truly do parallel operations. In multicore systems, you should be able to perform truly-parallel operations.</p>

<p>So it seems to me that currently the problems facing multicore programming are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Multicore programming is a difficult concept that requires significant skill</li>
<li>There are no native constructs in today's programming languages that provide a good abstraction to program for a multicore environment</li>
<li>Other than Intel's TBB library I haven't found efforts in other programming-languages to leverage the power of multicore architectures for compilation (for example, I don't know if the Java or C# compiler optimizes the bytecode for multicore systems or even if the JIT compiler does that)</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm interested in knowing what other problems there might be, and if there are any solutions in the works to address these problems. Links to research papers (and things of that nature) would be helpful. Thanks! </p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>If I had to condense my question down to one sentence, it would be this: What are the problems that face multicore programming today and what research is going on in the field to solve these problems?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>It also seems to me that there are three levels where multicore needs to be concerned:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Language level</strong>: Constructs/concepts/frameworks that abstract parallelization and concurrency and make it easy for programmers to express the same</li>
<li><strong>Compiler level</strong>: If the compiler is aware of what architecture it is compiling for, it can optimize the compiled code for that architecture.</li>
<li><strong>OS level</strong>: The OS optimizes the running process and perhaps schedules different threads/processes to run on different cores.</li>
</ol>

<p>I've searched on ACM and IEEE and have found a few papers. Most of them talk about how difficult it is to think concurrently and also how current languages don't have a proper way to express concurrency. Some have gone so far as to claim that the current model of concurrency that we have (threads) is not a good way to handle concurrency (even on multiple cores). I'm interested in hearing other views.</p>

<p>Inertia. (BTW: that's pretty much the answer to <em>all</em> ""what does prevent the widespread adoption"" questions, whether that be models of parallel programming, garbage collection, type safety or fuel-efficient automobiles.)</p>

<p>We have known since the 1960s that the threads+locks model is fundamentally broken. By ~1980, we had about a dozen better models. And yet, the vast majority of languages that are in use today (including languages that were newly created from scratch long after 1980), offer only threads+locks.</p>

<p>In the talk, he argues that what we call ""Software Engineering"" today, is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of what Software is and what Engineering is.

<p>At the moment, the only production-ready Ruby execution engine that implements Ruby 1.9 fully is YARV.</p>

<p>JRuby itself is production-ready, and it implements both Ruby 1.8.7 and Ruby 1.9.2, but the Ruby 1.9.2 implementation is not yet complete. IronRuby and Rubinius are also working on implementations of Ruby 1.9.2. MacRuby has a fairly complete Ruby 1.9 implementation, but it is still far from a 1.0 release. MRI doesn't implement Ruby 1.9 and probably never will.</p>

<p>But I don't understand why you are so concerned about the syntax. Syntax differences are trivial to spot: if there <em>were</em> a difference in the syntax, the engine would simply refuse to parse your file and you would know immediately that there is something wrong. Differences in <em>semantics</em> on the other hand are much more dangerous.</p>

"<p>Hi 
I'm looking for an equivalent of the haskell instersperse function  in Ruby. Basically that add something (like a separator) between each element of a list.</p>

<pre><code>intersperse(nil, [1,2,3]) =&gt; [1,nil,2,nil,3,nil,4].
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not asking for any code (I can do it , and I'd probably have done it before you read the question). I'm just wondering if a such function already exists on the standard Ruby platform.</p>

<h3>update</h3>

<p>I'm not asking for any code, and especially ones using flatten, as that doesn't work (flatten does not only flat one level but all).
I gave the example [1,2,3] just as example, but it should work with</p>

<pre><code> [[1,2],[3,4]].interperse(""hello"") =&gt; [[1,2], ""hello"", [3,4]]
</code></pre>

<p>(Please don't send me any code to make that it work , I have it already </p>

<pre><code>class Array
  def intersperse(separator)
    (inject([]) { |a,v|  a+[v,separator] })[0...-1]

","2988","","<p>No, not that I know of. But you can always <a href=""http://Ruby-Doc.Org/ruby-1.9/classes/Enumerable.html"" rel=""nofollow"">check yourself</a>.</p>

<p>The only similar method (by the way: Ruby is an object-oriented language, there is no such thing as a ""function"" in Ruby) is <code>Array#join</code>, which maps the elements to strings and interperses them with a separator. <code>Enumerable#intersperse</code> would basically be a generalization of that.</p>

<p>Like you said, it's trivial to implement, for example like this:</p>

<pre><code>module Enumerable
  def intersperse(obj=nil)
    map {|el| [obj, el] }.flatten(1).drop(1)
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>or this:</p>

<pre><code>module Enumerable
  def intersperse(obj=nil)
    drop(1).reduce([first]) {|res, el| res &lt;&lt; obj &lt;&lt; el }
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Which would then make <code>Array#join</code> simply a special case:</p>

<pre><code>class Array
  def join(sep=$,)
    map(&amp;:to_s).intersperse(s ||= sep.to_str).reduce('', :&lt;&lt;)

Since Gridgain 3.0-beta already provides scala-compiler-2.7.7.jar and scala-library-2.7.7.jar, is it possible to get the Eclipse Scala Plugin to compile to Scala 2.7.7?</p>

<p>I tried removing the Scala Library 2.8 from the project build path and added both the 2.7 jars, but this didn't seem to work.</p>

<p>Would this be easier if I switched to Netbeans?</p>
","2988","","<p>Both the Eclipse plugin and the NetBeans plugin use the Scala Compiler for a lot of things from the simple stuff like syntax highlighting to stuff like type inference, resolution and display of implicits to more involved stuff like automated type-driven refactorings and semantic highlighting.</p>

<p>And more specifically, they use the 2.8 compiler, because the 2.8 compiler has a completely refactored API and a new framework (the so-called <em>presentation compiler</em>), which is <em>specifically</em> designed for IDEs, so that they can get all the information they need <em>out</em> of the compiler, but also can feed information (like in the case of refactorings) back <em>into</em> the compiler.</p>

<p>So, in short: the version of the plugin is closely coupled to the version of the compiler, and the compiler in turn only supports one version of the language. In particular, the IDE plugins require a 2.8 version of the compiler, because they use the new presentation compiler framework, and the 2.8 compiler does not support the 2.7 language.</p>

<p>This tight coupling is of course <em>not</em> a good thing, and it will get broken up in the future, but for now, you are stuck.</p>

<p>You <em>could</em> try the IntelliJ IDEA IDE and their Scala plugin.

The Scala Plugin does work with the Community Edition.</p>

<p>Not necessarily. <code>502</code> only means that <em>some</em> gateway, somewhere, <em>anywhere</em>, between you and rubygems.org didn't respond properly. This could be pretty much any server that sits in between you and rubygems.org: your company's proxy, your company's firewall, your own proxy, your own firewall, (one of) your provider's prox(y/ies), (one of) your provider's firewall(s), (one of) rubygems.org's hosting provider's firewall(s), rubygems.org's load balancer, your government's web content filter, or really <em>any</em> other server that sits&nbsp;&ndash; for whatever reason&nbsp;&ndash; between you and rubygems.org.</p>

</ol>

<p>Thanks for any feedback.</p>
","2988","","<p>The gem path changing doesn't really have anything do with updating RubyGems. It has to do with the fact that you have <em>two</em> parallel installations of RubyGems: the one from the Debian package repository which you installed via APT and another one.</p>

<p>The solution is simple: Don't Do That.</p>

<p>The Debian RubyGems has been patched to install its gems in <code>/var/lib/gems</code>, the RubyGems from RubyGems.Org uses <code>/usr/lib/ruby/gems</code> if that is writeable, <code>~/.gem</code> otherwise.</p>

<p>You should <em>never</em> mix several different installations of RubyGems, and you should <em>particularly</em> not mix Debian-RubyGems and plain RubyGems. <em>Either</em> install RubyGems from Debian and use <em>only</em> that, and <em>only</em> update it with APT <em>or</em> install RubyGems from RubyGems.Org and use <em>only</em> that and <em>only</em> update it via <code>gem update --system</code>. Note that this transitively also applies to YARV, which contains its own copy of RubyGems. <em>If</em> you use Debian-RubyGems, then you must <em>also</em> use the Debian-packaged versions of YARV, because only the Debian packages of YARV have been patched to remove RubyGems and use the Debian-provided one.</p>

<p>Somehow, you managed to ""update"" your Debian-RubyGems to a plain one, which isn't really an update but actually more like a separate installation. This shouldn't actually happen, because the Debian-RubyGems has the update functionality removed. This is what <em>my</em> Debian-installed RubyGems prints:</p>

<pre><code>gem update --system
# ERROR:  While executing gem ... (RuntimeError)
# gem update --system is disabled on Debian. RubyGems can be updated using the 
# official Debian repositories by aptitude or apt-get.

<p>1.3.5 is pretty old, so maybe that error check wasn't in there, although I doubt it. AFAIK that error check was introduced somewhere in the 1.2 timeframe.</p>

"<p>It does not look very good for me to always repeat a line-long tuple definition every time I need it. Can I just name it and use as a type name? Would be nice to name its fields also instead of using ._1, ._2 etc.</p>
","2988","","<p>Regarding your first question, you can simply use a type alias:</p>

<pre><code>type KeyValue = (Int, String)
</code></pre>

<p>And, of course, Scala is an object-oriented language, so regarding your second about how to specialize a tuple, the magic word is <em>inheritance</em>:</p>

<pre><code>case class KeyValue(key: Int, value: String) extends (Int, String)(key, value)
</code></pre>

<p>That's it. The class doesn't even need a body.</p>

kvp._1    // =&gt; res0: Int    = 42
kvp.value // =&gt; res1: String = ""Hello""

<p>Note, however, that inheriting from case classes (which <code>Tuple2</code> is), is deprecated and may be disallowed in the future. Here's the compiler warning you get for the above class definition:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>warning: case class <code>class KV</code> has case class ancestor <code>class Tuple2</code>.  This has been deprecated for unduly complicating both usage and implementation.  You should instead use extractors for pattern matching on non-leaf nodes.</p>

"<p>I am a C#/.Net developer who just began Java development for Android, and using Eclipse I noticed that it compiles as you go, so that at no point do you have to wait for the program to build. This seems pretty amazing, unless there is something going on I don't understand.</p>

<p>I was wondering why C# and the Visual Studio IDE don't provide this functionality? Is there a reason?</p>
","2988","","<p>This doesn't really have anything to do with Java. It's more a feature of Eclipse. In particular, incremental background compilation is a standard feature of all Smalltalk IDEs since at least 1978 or thereabouts, and even longer than that in Lisp IDEs.</p>

<p>Eclipse <em>was</em> originally a Smalltalk IDE, written in Smalltalk, and it is still to this day maintained by IBM's Smalltalk division. So, when IBM's Smalltalk division developed their own Java compiler, they naturally wrote it to be incremental and re-entrant, just like their Smalltalk compilers. And this compiler, called <em>Jikes</em> was open-sourced together with Eclipse and became the <em>ecj (Eclipse Compiler for Java)</em> that powers all of the incremental on-the-fly compilation, syntax highlighting, code completion, type inference and refactoring capabilities of Eclipse JDT.</p>

<p>There is absolutely no reason why this shouldn't be possible for C# as well. The reason why it <em>doesn't</em> work, is because the compiler doesn't support it, in particular, the compiler is not incremental. But that is not an inherent limitation of .NET or C# or Visual Studio, that's a limitation in the imagination of the C# compiler maintainers: traditionally, all compilers at Microsoft were written in C++ by the C++ compiler team, and those guys simply have never heard of incremental compilation. Not because they are stupid, but because in the C++ community nobody cares about that.</p>

<p>But, for example, the VB community <em>does</em> care about that stuff, because they are used to it from VB Classic. So, the VB.NET compiler actually supports incremental building, edit-and-continue, IntelliSense, type inference and refactoring.</p>

<p>Of course, the C# plugin supports a lot of that stuff, too, but they don't use the actual C# compiler to do that. Instead, they basically had to re-implement half of the compiler for the Visual Studio plugin to work, but they didn't implement the actual code generation backend, so while the ""compiler"" which is part of the plugin <em>can</em> do incremental parsing, syntax highlighting, refactoring and edit-and-continue, it <em>cannot</em> actually, you know, <em>compile</em>.</p>

<p>The situation for C# is going to change, however: the responsibility for the compilers was reassigned to the respective language teams, and the C# team is currently in the process of re-implementing the compiler <em>in</em> C# and <em>within</em> the C# team. One of the often talked about results of this rewrite is going to be the Compiler-as-a-Service feature, which allows you to compile small snippets of C# and/or Expression Trees on-the-fly and which powers for example the also often demonstrated C# REPL and C# Scripting capabilities.</p>

<p>Given that in order for the REPL to work, the compiler needs to be able to compile small individual snippets of code <em>anyway</em>, <em>and</em> the new compiler is supposed to be used in the Visual Studio C# plugin to replace the current pile of IntelliSense and syntax highlighting hacks, it shouldn't be too hard to get incremental compilation going in Visual Studio.</p>

"<p>I know that l1 and l2 caches are levels in multi-level cache.<br>
I would like to know where each level cache is placed, and what is the maximum number of cache levels allowed?</p>
","2988","","<p>Both of these depend on the CPU. There are CPUs which have no cache at all, there are CPUs which have the L1 cache on die and the L2 cache on a separate die on the same chip or even on a separate chip, or there are CPUs which have both L1 and L2 cache on the same die as the CPU core.</p>

<p>There are multi-core, multi-chip CPUs where each core has its own L1 cache on die, the 4 cores of one multi-core chip share an L2 cache that is on chip, but on a separate die, and the 2 chips share an L3 cache that is on a separate chip, but in the same package. Sometimes, there are also so-called <em>CPU books</em> which contain multiple chip packages, which might or might not have their own shared cache, which would then be an L4 cache.</p>

<p>Of course, multi-core chips don't have to share their L2 cache, they can also have private L2 caches.</p>

<p>And it's not always obvious, what level a certain cache is, or even whether or not a piece of RAM is a cache at all.</p>

<p>For example, on later Intel 80486 processors, there was an L1 cache on the chip and an L2 cache on the motherboard. But then AMD came out with a socket-compatible CPU that had both an L1 and L2 cache on the chip. So, the exact same cache chip on the motherboard was either an L2 or L3 cache, depending on what kind of CPU you used.</p>

<p>On the Cell BE CPU, the SPEs have 256&thinsp;KiByte of RAM each. Except that this RAM has about the same size and the same speed as a typical L2 cache, and since the SPEs don't have any other caches, you could also view this as a cache. However, caches are normally managed automatically by the CPU, whereas RAM is typically managed by the user program, the language runtime or the OS, not the CPU. So, is this RAM or a cache? It turns out that, in order to achieve best performance, you should really <em>not</em> view this as RAM, but more as a software-controlled cache.</p>

","2988","","<p>Ruby has open classes, which means that anybody can modify any class at any time. There's no way to prevent that. And problems like the one you are describing are exactly the reason why every manual, every tutorial, every course, every FAQ teaches <em>not</em> to do that.</p>

<p>Over the last 10 years or so, there has been talk of adding <em>selector namespaces</em> to Ruby 2.0, to provide lexically scoped monkey patching. More recently, matz has set his sights on <a href=""http://scg.unibe.ch/research/classboxes/"" rel=""nofollow""><em>classboxes</em></a>. It looks very likely that Ruby 2.0 will provide classboxes to limit the scope of monkey patching, but until then, your best bet is to file a bug with the author of that library.</p>

"<p>How can I mock the initialize method on a ruby class?</p>

<p>I'm doing some testing and want to mock out the object that is created from a new call.  </p>

<p>I tried to write a few things and none of them seemed to get the mock class to return from the new call.  It just keeps returning the normal, expected object.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>one attempt -</p>

<pre><code>class MockReminderTimingInfoParser &lt; ReminderTimingInfoParser
  def new(blank)
    ReminderTimingInfoParserForTest.new
  end
end

describe ReminderParser do
  parser = ReminderParser.new(MockReminderTimingInfoParser)

  it ""should parse line into a Reminder"" do
    parser.parse("" doesnt matter  \""message\"""").should == Reminder.new('message', ReminderTimingInfo.new([DaysOfWeek.new([:sundays])], [1]))
  end
end

class ReminderTimingInfoParserForTest
  include TimingInfoParser

  def parse_section(section); [DaysOfWeek.new([:sundays]), 1] end

  def reminder_times_converter(times); times end
end
</code></pre>
","2988","","<pre><code>class MockReminderTimingInfoParser &lt; ReminderTimingInfoParser
  def new(blank)
    ReminderTimingInfoParserForTest.new
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Here, you are defining a method called <code>new</code> for all instances of the class <code>MockReminderTimingInfoParser</code>. In your question, you mention that you want to hook into instance creation. However, in Ruby, instance creation is not done by instance methods. Obviously, this cannot work, since in order to call an instance method, you'd need to have an instance first!</p>

<p>Instead, instances are created by calling a factory method (commonly called <code>new</code>) on the class.</p>

<p>In other words, in order to create an instance of <code>MockReminderTimingInfoParser</code>, you would call <code>MockReminderTimingInfoParser.new</code>, but you have defined a method <code>MockReminderTimingInfoParser#new</code>. In order to call the method you have defined, you would have to call <code>MockReminderTimingInfoParser.new.new</code>.</p>

<p>You need to define a method on <code>MockReminderTimingInfoParser</code>'s singleton class. There's several ways to do that. One way would be just mimicking the way you would <em>call</em> the method:</p>

<pre><code>def MockReminderTimingInfoParser.new(blank)
  ReminderTimingInfoParserForTest.new
end
</code></pre>

<p>Another would be opening up <code>MockReminderTimingInfoParser</code>'s singleton class:</p>

<pre><code>class &lt;&lt; MockReminderTimingInfoParser
  def new(blank)
    ReminderTimingInfoParserForTest.new
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>However, in both of these cases, <code>MockReminderTimingInfoParser</code> obviously has to exist first. Given that you need to define the class anyway, here's the most idiomatic way of defining methods on a class's (or module's) singleton class:</p>

<pre><code>class MockReminderTimingInfoParser &lt; ReminderTimingInfoParser
  def self.new(blank)
    ReminderTimingInfoParserForTest.new
  end
end

"<p>Are there any tests that compare Javascript's performance with Java's?</p>

<p>UPDATE: Since everyone is asking why the hell this question, here is some context :)</p>

<p>As you all know - I hope - Javascript nowadays doesn't only reside in the web client but also in the web server with node.js.</p>

<p>It could also be run in mobile phones and dekstops with appcelerator and phonegap.</p>

<p>It could also be used substantially in the web browser to make the user experience first class like with desktop applications.</p>

<p>But Java could do these things too, running applets on the web client, and on mobile phones. It's also a language for the backend with many frameworks to choose between.</p>

<p>Since each one of them could almost/entirely replace each other in the mentioned area, I want to know the performance difference between them, for every case I described:</p>

<ul>
<li>Client: Java Applets vs Javascript</li>
<li>Server: Java EE vs Javascript with Node.js + Express</li>
<li>Mobile phones: Java ME vs Javascript with Phonegap / Appcelerator</li>
<li>Desktop: Java SE vs Javascript with Phonegap / Appcelerator</li>
</ul>

<p>I hope the context is more clear now.</p>
","2988","","<p>Java and JavaScript are both programming languages. Programming languages are just a bunch of abstract mathematical rules. Programming languages aren't fast. Or slow. They just <em>are</em>.</p>

<p>The performance of an application has nothing to do with the language. The most important factor is the application architecture. Then comes algorithmic efficiency. Then micro-optimizations. Then comes the quality of the compiler/interpreter. Then the CPU. Maybe a couple of other steps in between. The language, however, doesn't directly play a role. (And of course if you're talking about benchmarks, then also the particular benchmark plays a role, as well as how well implemented the benchmark is, how well run it is, whether the guy who performs the benchmark actually <em>knows</em> something about benchmarking, and even more importantly statistics. Also, the <em>precise</em> definition of what you actually <em>mean</em> by ""fast"" is pretty important, since it can also have significant influence on the benchmark.)</p>

<p>However, the language might indirectly play a role: it is much easier to find and fix performance bottlenecks in 10 lines of highly expressive, clear, concise, readable, well-factored, isolated, high-level Lisp code, than in 100 lines of tangled, low-level C. (Note that those two languages are only examples. I don't mean to single any one language out.) Twitter, for example, have said that with a less expressive language than Ruby, they wouldn't have been able to make such radical changes to their architecture in such a short amount of time, to fix their scalability problems. And the reason why Node.js is able to provide such good evented I/O performance is because JavaScript's standard library is so crappy. (That way, Node.js has to provide all I/O itself, so they can optimize it for evented I/O from the ground up. Ruby and Python, for example, have evented I/O libraries that work just as well as Node.js and are much more mature ... but, Ruby and Python already have large standard libraries, including I/O libraries, all of which are synchronous and don't play well with evented libraries. JavaScript doesn't have the problem of I/O libraries that don't play well with evented I/O, because JavaScript doesn't have I/O libraries <em>at all</em>.)</p>

<p>But if you <em>really</em> want to compare the two, here's an interesting datapoint for you: HotSpot, which is one of the more popular, and also more performant JVM implementations out there, was created by a team of guys which included, among other people, a guy named Lars Bak. But actually, HotSpot didn't appear out of thin air, it was based on the sourcecode of the Anamorphic Smalltalk VM, which was created by a team of guys which included, among other people, a guy named Lars Bak.</p>

<p>V8, which is one of the more popular, and also more performant JavaScript implementations out there, was created by a team of guys which included, among other people, a guy named Lars Bak. But actually, V8 didn't appear out of thin air, it was based on the sourcecode of the Anamorphic Smalltalk VM, which was created by a team of guys which included, among other people, a guy named Lars Bak.</p>

<p>Given that the two are more or less the same, we can expect similar performance. The only difference is that HotSpot has over a hundred engineers working on it for 15 years, whereas V8 has a dozen engineers working for less than 5 years. <em>That</em> is the <em>only</em> difference in performance. It's not about static vs. dynamic typing (Java <em>is</em> statically typed, but most JVMs and certainly HotSpot make no static optimizations whatsoever, all optimizations are purely dynamic), compilation vs. interpretation (HotSpot is actually interpreted with an additional JIT compiler, whereas V8 is purely compiled), high-level vs. low-level. It is purely about money.</p>

<p>But I am going to bet that for every pair of Java and JavaScript implementations where the Java implementation is faster, I can find another pair where the JavaScript implementation is faster. Also, I can probably <em>keep</em> the pair and just use a different benchmark. There's a <em>reason</em> the call the Computer Languages Benchmark Game a ""game"": they even <em>encourage</em> you right on their own page to play around with the benchmarks to make any arbitrary language rise to the top.</p>

","2988","","<p><code>grep</code> is defined on <code>Enumerable</code>, i.e. it is a generic method that doesn't know anything about <code>Hash</code>es. It operates on whatever the elements of the <code>Enumerable</code> are.

<p><code>grep</code> uses the <code>===</code> method to filter out elements. And since neither</p>

"<p>The <code>upcase</code> method capitalizes the entire string.</p>

<p>I need to capitalize only the first letter.</p>

<p>Also, I need to support several popular languages, like ""German"", ""Russian"" etc.</p>

<p>How do I do it?</p>
","2988","","<p>Unfortunately, it is impossible for a machine to upcase/downcase/capitalize properly. It needs way too much contextual information for a computer to understand.</p>

<p>That's why Ruby's <code>String</code> class only supports capitalization for ASCII characters, because there it's at least <em>somewhat</em> well-defined.</p>

<p>What do I mean by ""contextual information""?</p>

<p>For example, to capitalize <code>i</code> properly, you need to know which language the text is in. English, for example, has only two <code>i</code>s: capital <code>I</code> without a dot and small <code>i</code> with a dot. But Turkish has four <code>i</code>s: capital <code>I</code> without a dot, capital <code>İ</code> with a dot, small <code>ı</code> without a dot, small <code>i</code> with a dot. So, in English <code>'i'.upcase # =&gt; 'I'</code> and in Turkish <code>'i'.upcase # =&gt; 'İ'</code>. In other words: since <code>'i'.upcase</code> can return two different results, depending on the language, it is obviously impossible to correctly capitalize a word without knowing its language.</p>

<p>But Ruby doesn't know the language, it only knows the encoding. Therefore it is impossible to properly capitalize a string with Ruby's built-in functionality.</p>

<p>It gets worse: even <em>with</em> knowing the language, it is sometimes impossible to do capitalization properly. For example, in German, <code>'Maße'.upcase # =&gt; 'MASSE'</code> (<em>Maße</em> is the plural of <em>Maß</em> meaning <em>measurement</em>). However, <code>'Masse'.upcase # =&gt; 'MASSE'</code> (meaning <em>mass</em>). So, what is <code>'MASSE'.capitalize</code>? In other words: correctly capitalizing requires a full-blown Artificial Intelligence.</p>

<p>So, instead of sometimes giving the wrong answer, Ruby chooses to sometimes give no answer <em>at all</em>, which is why non-ASCII characters simply get ignored in downcase/upcase/capitalize operations. (Which of course also reads to wrong results, but at least it's easy to check.)</p>

","2988","","<p>You cannot fix an ugly test by rewriting the test. You can only fix it by redesigning the API that is being tested.</p>

<p>Well, technically, it <em>is</em> possible to write ugly tests for good APIs if you try <em>really</em> hard, are very evil, very, stupid, very drunk or very tired. But writing an ugly test takes <em>effort</em> and programmers are lazy, so it is very unlikely that someone would write an ugly test by choice. It is almost impossible to write ugly tests: you stick something in, you get something out, you check whether you got what you expected. That's it. There's really nothing to uglify there.</p>

<p>A test just uses the API the same way a user of the API would use it. It's basically an example of how to use the API properly, that also, almost as a side-effect, happens to check that the API is actually <em>implemented</em> properly. That's why an ugly test is a good indicator for bad API design, and it's also why test-driving the API design is a good thing, even if you don't do TDD.</p>

<p>In this particular case, I can see quite a few ways to improve the API, although these suggestions are necessarily incomplete, shallow and simplistic (not to mention probably wrong), since I don't know anything about your domain:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Better Names</em>: <code>setRoot</code> sounds like it is setting the root. But, unless <code>false</code> is the root of your hierarchy, I assume that what it is <em>actually</em> setting is whether or not this Tag is the root. So, it should rather be named <code>isRoot</code> or <code>makeRoot</code> or <code>setIsRoot</code> or something like that.</li>
<li><em>Better Defaults</em>: continuing with <code>setRoot</code>, assuming that my guess is correct and this sets whether or not the Tag is the root, then the default is the wrong way around. By the very definition of the concept of ""root"", there can only ever be <em>one</em> root. So, you are forcing your users to specify <code>setRoot(false)</code> <em>every single time</em>, except for that <em>one</em> time when they are actually defining a root. Non-root Tags should be the default, and you should only be forced to <code>setRoot(true)</code> for that <em>one</em> Tag which actually <em>is</em> the root.</li>
<li><em>Better Defaults, Part II</em>: <code>setRole(null)</code>. Seriously? You are forcing your users to explicitly <em>set</em> the role to be <em>unset</em>? Why not simply make unset the default? After all, the test is called ""... when neither role nor root defined"", so why define them?</li>
<li><em>Fluent API / Builder Pattern</em>: if you <em>really</em> have to construct invalid objects (but see next point), at least use something like a Fluent API or a Builder Pattern.</li>
<li><em>Only Construct Valid Objects</em>: But really, objects should always be valid, complete and fully configured, when constructed. You shouldn't have to construct an object, and <em>then</em> configure it.</li>
</ul>

<p>That way, the test basically becomes:</p>

<p>Note that <code>cd</code> is <em>not</em> on that list, which means that <code>cd</code> is not a special built-in. In fact, <a href=""http://OpenGroup.Org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/cd.html"">according to the specification</a>, it would be perfectly legal to implement <code>cd</code> as a regular executable. It's just not possible, for the reasons given by the other answers.</p>

<p>And if you scroll down to the non-normative section of the specification, i.e. to the part that is not officially part of the specification but only purely informational, you will find that fact explicitly mentioned:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since cd affects the current shell execution environment, it is always provided as a <em>shell regular built-in</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, the specification doesn't require <code>cd</code> to be a built-in, but it's simply impossible to do otherwise.</p>

"<p>I have recently come across <code>SCALA</code> while going through the designs of twitter and linkedin. A part of the twitter and linkedin are being shifted to scala for scalability which where originally developed in RoR?</p>

<p>Does changing the programming language guarantee scalability? How exactly is this decided? Can there by any pre-planning on how to scale while designing the system?</p>

<p>Can anyone please give me some insights on this ?</p>

<p>Cheers.</p>
","2988","","<p>This seems to be a typical instance of conflating coincidence and causality. Twitter changed their architecture, which solved their scalability problems. At the same time, they also happened to introduce a new programming language, but this doesn't mean that this was responsible for fixing their problems.</p>

<p>Twitter was originally envisioned as a CMS platform. So, it was architected as a CMS, with a database at the center. However, users didn't use it as a CMS, they used it as a messaging platform. A database is pretty much the worst case scenario for a messaging platform: a messaging platform needs a message queue at the center. So, Twitter wrote a message queue that complements their database, and that helped their scalability problems somewhat.</p>

<p>This message queue was actually written in Ruby. So, no Scala there. (BTW: the name of the language is <em>Scala</em>, not <em>SCALA</em>. It's not an acronym.)</p>

<p>This first message queue also had scalability problems. Not because it was written in Ruby, but because it was the first time that any of the developers had ever written a message queue. So, they wrote another message queue. This time, they had all the experience from the first message queue, so this one was better. And it happened to be written in Scala.</p>

<p>The reason why Twitter had scalability problems at the beginning was not because of Ruby, it was because there had never been a Twitter before, and nobody knew how to scale it.</p>

<p>The reason why it scales now, is because they learned how to scale it, not because of Scala. (In fact, large parts of Twitter are still implemented in Ruby. Others are in C++, and there's some Erlang, too, I believe.)</p>

<p>Architecture scales. Good languages can make it easier to find performance and scalability bottlenecks (by simply having less code to look through), and make it easier to do large scale architecture refactoring (again: less code), but ultimately, it's about the architecture.</p>

"<p>In Ruby, I have a hash of objects. Each object has a type and a value. I am trying to design an efficient function that can get the average of the values of all of objects of a certain type within the hash.</p>

<p>Here is an example of how this is currently implemented:</p>

<pre><code>#the hash is composed of a number of objects of class Robot (example name)
class Robot
  attr_accessor :type, :value

  def initialize(type, value)
    @type = type
    @value = value
  end

end


#this is the hash that inclues the Robot objects
hsh = { 56 =&gt; Robot.new(:x, 5), 21 =&gt; Robot.new(:x, 25), 45 =&gt; Robot.new(:x, 35), 31 =&gt; Robot.new(:y, 15), 0 =&gt; Robot.new(:y, 5) }


#this is the part where I find the average
total = 0
count = 0
hsh.each_value { |r|  
if r.type == :x        #is there a better way to get only objects of type :x ?
  total += r.value 
  count += 1
end
} 

average = total / count
</code></pre>

<p>So my question is:</p>

<p><b> is there a better way to do this that does not involve looping through the entire hash? </b></p>

<p>Note that I can't use the key values because there will be multiple objects with the same type in the same hash (and the key values are being used to signify something else already).</p>

<p>If there is an easy way to do this with arrays, that would also work (since I can convert the hash to an array easily).</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Unless I misunderstood what you are trying to say, this is <em>not</em> what the code you posted does. The average value of the <code>:x</code> robots is <code>21</code> (there's 3 <code>:x</code> robots, with values <code>5</code>, <code>25</code> and <code>35</code>; <code>5 + 25 + 35 == 65</code> and <code>65</code> divided by 3 robots is <code>21</code>), but your code (and mine, since I modeled mine after yours) prints <code>13</code>.</p>

<p>Yes. To select elements, use the <code>select</code> method.</p>

  <p>is there a better way to do this that does not involve looping through the entire hash?</p>

<p>No. If you want to find all objects with a given property, you have to look at all objects to see whether or not they have that property.</p>

"<p>Haven't seen this ""feature"" anywhere else. I know that the 32nd bit is used for garbage collection. But why is it that way only for ints and not for the other basic types?</p>
","2988","","<p>This is called a <em>tagged pointer</em> representation, and is a pretty common optimization trick used in many different interpreters, VMs and runtime systems for decades. Pretty much every Lisp implementation uses them, many Smalltalk VMs, many Ruby interpreters, and so on.</p>

<p>Usually, in those languages, you always pass around pointers to objects. An object itself consists of an object header, which contains object metadata (like the type of an object, its class(es), maybe access control restrictions or security annotations and so on), and then the actual object data itself. So, a simple integer would be represented as a pointer plus an object consisting of metadata and the actual integer. Even with a very compact representation, that's something like 6 Byte for a simple integer.</p>

<p>Also, you cannot pass such an integer object to the CPU to perform fast integer arithmetic. If you want to add two integers, you <em>really</em> only have two pointers, which point to the beginning of the object headers of the two integer objects you want to add. So, you first need to perform integer arithmetic on the first pointer to add the offset into the object to it where the integer data is stored. Then you have to dereference that address. Do the same again with the second integer. Now you have two integers you can actually ask the CPU to add. Of course, you need to now construct a new integer object to hold the result.</p>

<p>So, in order to perform <em>one</em> integer addition, you actually need to perform <em>three</em> integer additions plus two pointer dererefences plus one object construction. And you take up almost 20 Byte.</p>

<p>However, the trick is that with so-called <em>immutable value types</em> like integers, you usually don't <em>need</em> all the metadata in the object header: you can just leave all that stuff out, and simply synthesize it (which is VM-nerd-speak for ""fake it""), when anyone cares to look. An integer will <em>always</em> have class <code>Integer</code>, there's no need to separately store that information. If someone uses reflection to figure out the class of an integer, you simply reply <code>Integer</code> and nobody will ever know that you didn't actually store that information in the object header and that in fact, there <em>isn't</em> even an object header (or an object).</p>

<p>So, the trick is to store the value <em>of</em> the object within the pointer <em>to</em> the object, effectively collapsing the two into one.</p>

<p>There are CPUs which actually have additional space within a pointer (so-called <em>tag bits</em>) that allow you to store extra information about the pointer within the pointer itself. Extra information like ""this isn't actually a pointer, this is an integer"". Examples include the Burroughs B5000, the various Lisp Machines or the AS/400. Unfortunately, most of the current mainstream CPUs don't have that feature.</p>

<p>However, there is a way out: most current mainstream CPUs work significantly slower when addresses aren't aligned on word boundaries. Some even don't support unaligned access at all.</p>

<p>What this means is that in practice, <em>all</em> pointers will be divisible by 4, which means they will <em>always</em> end with two <code>0</code> bits. This allows us to distinguish between <em>real</em> pointers (that end in <code>00</code>) and pointers which are actually integers in disguise (those that end with <code>1</code>). And it still leaves us with all pointers that end in <code>10</code> free to do other stuff. Also, most modern operating systems reserve the very low addresses for themselves, which gives us another area to mess around with (pointers that start with, say, 24 <code>0</code>s and end with <code>00</code>).</p>

<p>So, you can encode a 31-bit integer into a pointer, by simply shifting it 1 bit to the left and adding <code>1</code> to it. And you can perform <em>very fast</em> integer arithmetic with those, by simply shifting them appropriately (sometimes not even that is necessary).</p>

<p>What do we do with those other address spaces? Well, typical examples include encoding <code>float</code>s in the other large address space and a number of special objects like <code>true</code>, <code>false</code>, <code>nil</code>, the 127 ASCII characters, some commonly used short strings, the empty list, the empty object, the empty array and so on near the <code>0</code> address.</p>

<p>For example, in the MRI, YARV and Rubinius Ruby interpreters, integers are encoded the way I described above, <code>false</code> is encoded as address <code>0</code> (which just so happens <em>also</em> to be the representation of <code>false</code> in C), <code>true</code> as address <code>2</code> (which just so happens to be the C representation of <code>true</code> shifted by one bit) and <code>nil</code> as <code>4</code>.</p>

"<p>This may be a question that others have seen, but I am trying to find a language designed for (or with language support for) concurrent programming that can run on the .net platform.  </p>

<p>I have been doing side development in erlang to get a feel for the language and have loved how easy it is to get a stable concurrent or even distributed system up.

","2988","","<p>Axum is a research project. A <em>real</em> research project, where only ideas from it will end up in products. (Unlike F#, which was productized as a whole.) I'm not even sure the license allows using it to develop production applications.</p>

<p>Clojure also runs on the CLI, and is a good choice, too.</p>

<p>The CLI port of Scala is currently in the process of being resurrected (with officiall funding from Microsoft, actually), and Scala's Actor libraries (both the built-in one, as well as Akka) are pretty good.</p>

<p>Regarding @wmeyer's comment above: Scala itself doesn't have any provisions for distributed programming. (Neither does Clojure.) Both generally rely on the myriad of Java frameworks that exist for that purpose, such as Terracotta. However, Akka <em>does</em> have Remote Actors for distributed programming, and Akka is largely API-compatible with the built-in Scala Actor library, which allows for a smooth transition.</p>

<p>Erlang would be kind of cool. Kresten Krab Thorup is currently working on Erjang, an Erlang implementation on the JVM, and he has some pretty impressive results: running on HotSpot, Erjang scales comparably to BEAM, sometimes even better. For example, in the (in)famous process-ring benchmark with 10000 processes, Erjang starts up only minimally slower than BEAM, but when you repeat the run several times and the JIT kicks in, it overtakes BEAM after about 3 runs (and curiously, BEAM starts slowing down after 4 runs).</p>

    puts ""say hello""
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Works:</p>

<pre><code>HomeWork.new.say_hello
# before
# say hello
# after
</code></pre>

<p>The basic problem in your code was that you renamed the method in your <code>before_filter</code> method, but then in your client code, you called <code>before_filter</code> before the method was actually defined, thus resulting in an attempt to rename a method which doesn't exist.</p>

<p>The solution is simple: Don't Do That&trade;!</p>

<p>Well, okay, maybe not so simple. You <em>could</em> simply force your clients to always call <code>before_filter</code> <em>after</em> they have defined their methods. However, that is bad API design.</p>

<p>So, you have to somehow arrange for your code to defer the wrapping of the method until it actually exists. And that's what I did: instead of redefining the method inside the <code>before_filter</code> method, I only record the fact that it is to be redefined later. Then, I do the <em>actual</em> redefining in the <code>method_added</code> hook.</p>

<p>There is a tiny problem in this, because if you add a method inside of <code>method_added</code>, then of course it will immediately get called again and add the method again, which will lead to it being called again, and so on. So, I need to guard against recursion.</p>

<p>Note that this solution actually <em>also</em> enforces an ordering on the client: while the OP's version <em>only</em> works if you call <code>before_filter</code> <em>after</em> defining the method, my version only works if you call it <em>before</em>. However, it is trivially easy to extend so that it doen't suffer from that problem.</p>

<p>Note also that I made some additional changes that are unrelated to the problem, but that I think are more Rubyish:</p>

<ul>
<li>use a mixin instead of a class: inheritance is a very valuable resource in Ruby, because you can only inherit from one class. Mixins, however, are cheap: you can mix in as many as you want. Besides: can you really say that Homework IS-A MethodInterception?</li>
<li>use <code>Module#define_method</code> instead of <code>eval</code>: <code>eval</code> is evil. 'Nuff said. (There was absolutely no reason whatsoever to use <code>eval</code> in the first place, in the OP's code.)</li>
<li>use the method wrapping technique instead of <code>alias_method</code>: the <code>alias_method</code> chain technique pollutes the namespace with useless <code>old_foo</code> and <code>old_bar</code> methods. I like my namespaces clean.</li>

"<p>Are there any sane analogues to LINQ (.NET) exists for Scala? </p>
","2988","","<p>It depends on what exactly you mean by ""LINQ"". LINQ is many things.</p>

<p>The most obvious answer would be: just use the .NET port of Scala. It gives you full native access to everything in .NET, which obviously includes LINQ.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the .NET port of Scala was dropped a couple of years ago. Fortunately, it was picked up again a couple of months ago, with official funding directly from Microsoft no less. You can expect a release sometime in the 2011/2012 timeframe.</p>

<p>Anyway, what is LINQ?</p>

<p>A couple of features where added to .NET and specifically C# and VB.NET <em>for</em> LINQ. They are not technically part of LINQ, but are necessary prerequisites: type inference, anonymous (structural) types, lambda expressions, function types (<code>Func&lt;T...&gt;</code> and <code>Action&lt;T...&gt;</code>) and expression trees. All of these have been in Scala for a long time, most have been there forever.</p>

<p>Also not directly part of LINQ, but in C#, LINQ query expressions can be used to generate XML, to emulate VB.NET's XML literals. Scala has XML literals, like VB.NET.</p>

<p>More specifically, LINQ is</p>

<ul>
<li>a specification for a set of standard query operators</li>
<li>a set of implementations for those operators (i.e. <code>IQueryable</code>, LINQ-to-XML, LINQ-to-SQL, LINQ-to-Objects)</li>
<li>a built-in embedded syntax for LINQ query comprehensions</li>
<li>a monad</li>

<p>In Scala, like in pretty much any other functional language (and in fact also pretty much any other object-oriented language, too), the query operators are simply part of the standard collections API. In .NET, they have a little bit weird names, whereas in Scala, they have the same standard names they have in other languages: <code>Select</code> is <code>map</code>, <code>Aggregate</code> is <code>reduce</code> (or <code>fold</code>), <code>SelectMany</code> is <code>flatMap</code>, <code>Where</code> is <code>filter</code> or <code>withFilter</code>, <code>orderBy</code> is <code>sort</code> or <code>sortBy</code> or <code>sortWith</code>, and there are <code>zip</code>, <code>take</code> and <code>takeWhile</code> and so on. So, that takes care of both the specification and the LINQ-to-Objects implementation. Scala's XML libraries also implement the collections APIs, which takes care of LINQ-to-XML.</p>

<p>SQL APIs are not built into Scala, but there are third-party APIs which implement the collection API.</p>

<p>Scala also has specialized syntax for those APIs, but unlike Haskell, which tries to make them look like imperative C blocks and C#, which tries to make them look like SQL queries, Scala tries to make them look like <code>for</code> loops. They are called <em><code>for</code> comprehensions</em> and are the equivalent to C#'s query comprehensions and Haskell's monad comprehensions. (They also replace C#'s <code>foreach</code> and generators (<code>yield return</code>)).</p>

<p>But if you <em>really</em> want to know whether or not there are analogues for LINQ in Scala, you will first have to specificy what exactly you mean by ""LINQ"". (And of course, if you want to know whether they are ""sane"", you will have to define that, too.)</p>

<p>BTW: there were several bugs in your code, that would have prevented it from working <em>anyway</em> regardless of your problem with variable scoping, because you used wrong syntax for dereferencing local variables: the syntax for dereferencing a variable is simply the name of the variable, e.g. <code>foo</code>, and not <code>#{foo}</code> (that's simply a syntax error).</p>

"<p>I have a Ruby program that takes about 4 minutes to complete task and I'd like to get it down to under 1 minute.</p>

<p>I tried ruby-prof from gem but enabling it increases running times to ~30 minutes, and doesn't even seem to preserve monotonicity particularly well (some changes reliably improve performance-with-profiler and as reliably deteriorate performance-without-profiler). This task also cannot really be broken down into parts that can be meaningfully profiled independently.</p>

<p>What's the current best way to profile Ruby code with lowest overhead?</p>

<p>I use OSX, but if for any reason profiler requires another OS, I might reboot.</p>

<p>EDIT: <code>perftools.rb</code> has much lower overhead, but results look rather dubious to be honest, way outside any reasonable sampling error - at the very least it must be messing with GC or i/o buffering or something like that, causing a lot of silly misattributions. It still beats ruby-prof.</p>

<p>I'll keep the question open in case someone knows anything better than that.</p>
","2988","","<p>I don't think you can do any better with either MRI or YARV.</p>

<p>Rubinius, however, has a built-in profiler (just call with <code>-Xprofile</code>) with much less overhead.</p>

<p>And with JRuby, you get the whole array of Java tooling, which includes some of the best profilers ever created. Even without specific support for JRuby, those tools can be quite helpful. Oracle JDK has this extremely cool <em>VisualVM</em> tool, which lets you visualize all sorts of stuff about your program (and AFAIK there's even a JRuby plugin for it). Oracle JRockit also has a great profiler. The Azul JVM is rumored to have an absolutely mindblowingly awesome profiler. I think J9 has a great one, too. And of course, there's <a href=""http://YourKit.Com/"" rel=""nofollow"">YourKit</a>.</p>

<p>Charles Oliver Nutter and other members of the JRuby community have recently written a series of articles on comprehending runtime behavior of Ruby code using JRuby. Mostly, those articles were written as a reaction to the <a href=""http://MemProf.Com/"" rel=""nofollow"">memprof library for MRI</a> and thus they tend to focus on memory profiling, but there is also some stuff about call profiling in there.</p>

<p>AFAIK, one of the goals for MacRuby was to be able to use XCode's runtime comprehension stuff (Instruments and Co.) for Ruby, but that's more of a long-term goal, I don't know if this is currently implemented.</p>

<p>Here's a little example from Rubinius:</p>

","2988","","<p>You don't. RubyGems can <em>install</em> multiple versions of the same Gem, but it only can ever activate <em>one</em>. That's one of the reasons why Bundler was created: it will at least check for such an incompatibility <em>before</em> you run the app.</p>

"<pre><code>&lt;%if @item.rigged %&gt;Yes&lt;%else%&gt;No&lt;%end%&gt;

<p>I was thinking of something like this?</p>

<pre><code>if @item.rigged ? ""Yes"" : ""No"" 
</code></pre>

<p>But it dosen't work. Ruby has the ||= but I""m not even sure how to use that thing. </p>
","2988","","<p>In Ruby, the condition and the <code>then</code> part of an <code>if</code> expression must be separated by either an expression separator (i.e. <code>;</code> or a newline) or the <code>then</code> keyword.</p>

<p>So, all of these would work:</p>

<pre><code>if @item.rigged then 'Yes' else 'No' end

if @item.rigged; 'Yes' else 'No' end

if @item.rigged
  'Yes' else 'No' end
</code></pre>

<p>There is also a conditional operator in Ruby, but that is completely unnecessary. The conditional operator is needed in C, because it is an operator: in C, <code>if</code> is a statement and thus cannot return a value, so if you want to return a value, you need to use something which <em>can</em> return a value. And the only things in C that can return a value are functions and operators, and since it is impossible to make <code>if</code> a function in C, you need an operator.</p>

<p>In Ruby, however, <code>if</code> is an expression. In fact, <em>everything</em> is an expression in Ruby, so it <em>already</em> can return a value. There is no need for the conditional operator to even <em>exist</em>, let alone use it.</p>

<p>BTW: it is customary to name methods which are used to ask a question with a question mark at the end, like this:</p>

<pre><code>@item.rigged?
</code></pre>

<p>This shows another problem with using the conditional operator in Ruby:</p>

<pre><code>@item.rigged? ? 'Yes' : 'No'
</code></pre>

<p>It's simply hard to read with the multiple question marks that close to each other.</p>

"<p>I'm looking for examples of functional code in ruby. Maybe you know some gems, where I can find such a code?</p>
","2988","","<p>A couple of months ago, I wondered whether it was possible to make a mixin that behaves <em>exactly</em> like <code>Enumerable</code>, but is based on <em>folding</em> instead of <em>enumerating</em>. Or more precisely, I already <em>knew</em> that it was possible to do this, since <em>fold</em> is a generic iteration operation that is equal in expressive power to <em>foreach</em>, but I wanted to know what it would look like and how hard it would be.</p>

<p>I got bored after I had implemented most methods up to the letter <em>g</em>, so it's incomplete. Also, the version I show here is simplified, since making it behave <em>exactly</em> like <code>Enumerable</code> is a PITA in Ruby. (For example, there are overloaded methods in there, but Ruby doesn't support overloading. This isn't a problem for most Ruby implementations, because they implement <code>Enumerable</code> in Java or C# or other languages that <em>do</em> support overloading, but it is pretty painful when doing it in pure Ruby, so I decided to leave it out.)</p>

<p><code>Enumerable</code> is full of higher-order procedures, and of course <em>fold</em> (or <code>reduce</code> / <code>inject</code> as it is called in Ruby) is <em>itself</em> a higher-order procedure, so this code is full of them.</p>

<pre><code>module Enumerable
  def all?
    reduce(true) {|res, el| res &amp;&amp; yield(el) }
  end

  def any?
    reduce(false) {|res, el| res || yield(el) }
  end

  def collect
    reduce([]) {|res, el| res + yield(el) }
  end
  alias_method :map, :collect

  def count
    reduce(0) {|res, el| res + 1 if yield el }
  end

  def detect
    reduce(nil) {|res, el| if yield el then el end unless res }
  end
  alias_method :find, :detect

  def drop(n=1)
    reduce([]) {|res, el| res.tap {|res| res + el unless n -= 1 &gt;= 0 }}
  end

  def each
    reduce(nil) {|_, el| yield el }
  end

  def each_with_index
    reduce(-1) {|i, el| (i+1).tap {|i| yield el, i }}
  end

  def find_all
    reduce([]) {|res, el| res.tap {|res| res + el if yield el }}
  end
  alias_method :select, :find_all

  def grep(pattern)
    reduce([]) {|res, el| res.tap {|res| res + yield(el) if pattern === el }}
  end

  def group_by
    reduce(Hash.new {|hsh, key| hsh[key] = [] }) {|res, el| res.tap {|res|
        res[yield el] &lt;&lt; el
    }}
  end

  def include?(obj)
    reduce(false) {|res, el| break true if res || el == obj }
  end

  def reject
    reduce([]) {|res, el| res.tap {|res| res + el unless yield el }}
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>You will notice that I use side-effects in some places. I could have written it without side-effects instead, but it would have been much more complicated. And the problem is that there is no way for me to ensure that the <code>reduce</code> method, which is provided by the <em>client</em> of the mixin, or any of the methods from the core library, don't have side-effects.</p>

<p>Another nice example is the <a href=""http://AppDesign.Com/products/open-source-projects/prelude-library/"" rel=""nofollow"">Prelude</a> library for Ruby, which is an implementation of some parts of the Haskell Prelude (Haskell's equivalent to Ruby's core library) in Ruby.</p>

"<p>I've never heard anyone speak of CORBA in anything but derisive terms which is odd considering that 10+ years ago it was the bee's knees.  Why did CORBA fall from grace?  Was it purely that the implementations were bad or was there something more fundamental?</p>
","2988","","<p>It's not just CORBA, it's RPC in general. This includes stuff like DCOM, Java-RMI, .NET Remoting and all the others as well.</p>

<p>The problem is basically that distributed computing is <em>fundamentally</em> different than local computing. RPC tries to pretend these differences don't exist, and makes remote calls look just like local calls. But, in order to build a good distributed system, you need to deal with those differences.</p>

<p>Bill Joy, Tom Lyon, L. Peter Deutsch and James Gosling identified 8 <em>Fallacies of Distributed Computing</em>, i.e. things that newcomers to distributed programming believe to be true, but that are actually false, which usually results in the failure of the project or a significant increase in cost and effort. RPC is the perfect embodiment of those fallacies, because it is built on those same wrong assumptions:</p>

<ol>
<li>The network is reliable.</li>
<li>Latency is zero.</li>
<li>Bandwidth is infinite.</li>
<li>The network is secure.</li>
<li>Topology doesn't change.</li>
<li>There is one administrator.</li>
<li>Transport cost is zero.</li>
<li>The network is homogeneous.</li>
</ol>

<p>All of this is true for local computing.</p>

<p>Take reliability, for example: if you call a method locally, then the call itself <em>always</em> suceeds. Sure, the called method itself may have an error, but the actual <em>calling</em> of the method will always succed. And the result will always be returned, or, if the method fails, an error will be signaled.</p>

<p>In a distributed system, this is not true: the act of <em>calling</em> the method <em>itself</em> may fail. I.e. from your end it looks like you called the method, but the call actually got lost on the network and never reached the method. Or, the method successfully received the call and performed the operation, but the result got lost on the way back to you. Or the method failed, but the error got lost.</p>

<p>Similar with latency: locally, calling a method is essentially free. The method <em>itself</em> may take an arbitrary amount of time to <em>compute</em> the answer, but the <em>call</em> is free. Over a network, a call may take hundreds of milliseconds.</p>

<p>That's why pretty much all RPC projects, including CORBA failed.</p>

<p>Note that the other way around works just fine: if you just pretend that <em>all</em> calls are <em>remote</em> calls, then the worst thing that can happen is that you lose a little bit of performance and your app contains some error handling code that will never be used. That's how Erlang works, for example.</p>

<p>In Erlang, processes <em>always</em> have separate heaps and separate garbage collectors, just like if they were running on different machines on different continents, even if those processes run on the same VM on the same CPU in the same address space. If you pass data from one process to another, that data is <em>always</em> copied, just like it would have to be, if the processes were on different machines. Calls are <em>always</em> made as asynchronous message sends.</p>

<p>So, making local and remote calls look <em>the same</em> is not the problem. Making them look like <em>local</em> calls is.</p>

<p>In CORBA, the problem is actually a bit more convoluted than that. They actually <em>did</em> make local calls look like remote calls, but since CORBA was designed by committee, remote calls were <em>incredibly</em> complex, because they had to be able to handle some incredibly absurd requirements. And that complexity was forced upon <em>everybody</em>, even for local calls.</p>

<p>Again, comparing to Erlang, the complexity is much lower. In Erlang, sending a message to a process is not more complex than calling a method in Java. The interface is basically the same, it's only the expectations that are different: method calls in Java are expected to be instantaneous and synchronous, in Erlang, message sends are expected to be asynchronous and have visible latency. But actually <em>using</em> them is not more involved than a simple local procedure call.</p>

<p>Another difference is that Erlang distinguishes between function calls, which can only happen inside a process and thus are always local, and message sends, which happen between processes and are assumed to be always remote, even if they aren't. In CORBA, all method calls are assumed to be remote.</p>

<p><strong>Answer found. to_str method needed.</strong></p>
","2988","","<p><code>#to_s</code> is for <em>representing</em> an object as a <code>String</code>. In your case, you need to <em>convert</em> the object to a <code>String</code>, because <code>String#+</code> only deals with <code>String</code>s. In Ruby, type conversions are done with the three letter form of the <code>to_X</code> methods, i.e. <code>to_int</code>, <code>to_ary</code>, <code>to_hash</code> (someone can't count to three ...), <code>to_str</code> and so on.</p>

<p>So, you need to implement <code>to_str</code>, in order to make that work.</p>

<p><em>However</em>, you should <em>only</em> implement <code>to_str</code>, if your object actually <em>is</em> a string! If it's something else, you <em>must not</em> implement <code>to_str</code> and rather have the clients explicitly represent it as a string using <code>to_s</code>.</p>

<p>Basically, implementing <code>to_str</code> in Ruby is like inheriting from <code>String</code> in Java: it means that <code>A</code> IS-A <code>String</code>.</p>

<p>As an example, look at which classes in the Ruby core library <em>actually</em> implement the type conversion methods:</p>

<ul>
<li>the only class that implements <code>to_ary</code>, is <code>Array</code> itself,</li>
<li>the only class that implements <code>to_hash</code>, is <code>Hash</code> itself and</li>
<li>the only class that implements <code>to_str</code>, is <code>String</code> itself.</li>
</ul>

<p>This should show you that implementing <code>to_str</code> is a <em>very</em> serious matter that should not be undertaken lightly.</p>

<p>The only conversion method that does not have only a trivial no-op implementation, is <code>to_int</code>, which is also implemented by <code>Float</code> and <code>Numeric</code>. And actually, I think that is a mistake, since there is an infinite number of <code>Float</code>s which aren't <code>Integer</code>s. And <code>Numeric</code> is a <em>superclass</em> of <code>Integer</code>, so saying that every <code>Numeric</code> IS-A <code>Integer</code> is even more strange.</p>

<p>I have no idea why such a type is not already provided by the JRE (it seems to me a massive oversight), so, unfortunately, you will have to roll your own.

"<p>I am currently involved in some interesting programming language research which has, up until now, centred around extending the upcoming Java 7.0 compiler with some very powerful programmer-productivity-based features. The work should be equally applicable to related programming languages such as C#.</p>

<p>I'm currently scoping out the options for prototyping a C# port of the functionality. I would prefer open-source options so that the fruits of this work can be shared with the broadest-possible audience. Thus the Mono C# compiler seems to be the most obvious starting point. I'm an experienced C# developer so writing the code isn't the problem. I'm mainly concerned about extending the compiler in a maintainable and supported fashion. In the Mono FAQ on the subject (<a href=""http://www.mono-project.com/FAQ%3a_Technical"" rel=""nofollow"">link</a>) it is stated that ""Mono has already been used as a foundation for trying out new ideas for the C# language (there are three or four compilers derived from Mono's C# compiler)"". Unfortunately, there are no further pointers than this and, so far, Google searches have not turned anything up.</p>

<p>I'm wondering if anybody out there has any information on this. Do <code>mcs</code>/<code>gmcs</code>/<code>dmcs</code> have a standard extensibility model? Specifically, I will be performing some interesting transformations on a program's abstract syntax tree. Is there a standard mechanism for inserting functionality into the compiler chain between abstract syntax tree generation and the type checker and then code generation?</p>

<p>Up until now I've written some ad-hoc extensions to the code (primarily in the code generator) but this doesn't seem to be a maintainable solution especially given that I intend to keep my extensions up to date with the Git trunk of Mono as much as possible. Furthermore it would be nice to be able to make updates to my extensions without having to recompile the whole compiler every time I make a change. I would like to be able to wrap all my AST manipulations into a single .NET assembly that could be dynamically loaded by <code>mcs</code>/<code>gmcs</code>/<code>dmcs</code> without having to hack at the core compiler code directly.</p>

<p>Any thoughts or pointers on extending the Mono C# compiler would be gratefully received!</p>

<p>UPDATES (23 October 2010)</p>

<p>In response to the responses to my question, I decided that I would start working on a branch of Mono in order to create a simple extensibility model for the compiler. It's in its very early stages, but here it is at GitHub:</p>

<p>If anybody would be interested in collaborating on this project, please let me know!</p>
","2988","","<p>Unfortunately, I cannot adequately answer your question, but if you look at the examples of C# extensions on Miguel de Icaza's blog, you will notice that all of them take the form of patches to the compiler, not plugins or extensions. This seems to indicate that there is no such API.</p>

<p>Note that all of these examples are of much smaller scope than what you seem to be working on:</p>

</ul>

<p>These are mostly localized syntactic sugar, with no ""interesting"" behavior. The fourth patch, for example, implements Cω's syntactic sugar for <code>IEnumerable</code>s, but without any of Cω's semantics that make this syntax interesting. If you look at the patch you can see that it literally does stupid syntactical expansion of <code>~T</code> &rarr; <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code>, as opposed to Cω, where member access and method invocation are properly lifted over streams.</p>

<p><a href=""https://connect.microsoft.com/Phoenix"" rel=""nofollow"">Microsoft Research's Phoenix Compiler Pipeline</a> was once explicitly touted as the solution to such extensibility problems, but it seems that it now focuses mostly on optimizations and analysis on the IR level in a code generation backend.

"<p>What are the advantages of <strike>OOP</strike> subtyping over typeclasses, if any? In other words, now that we have typeclasses, is there any reason to still use <strike>OOP</strike> subtyping? </p>

<p>PS: I am a Scala programmer.</p>
","2988","","<p>Personally, I find OOP easier to deal with within the constraints of what it handles well. In other words: in cases where you don’t actually <em>need</em> typeclasses, I find objects easier to understand.</p>

<p>However, this might just be an artifact of the syntactic overhead that the typical typeclass embedding of objects has. If Haskell had syntactic sugar for some common kinds of typeclass patterns, that difference would probably vanish.</p>

<p>What I find more interesting, is the fact that the Haskell community shows that typeclasses are more powerful than objects, since there exists a trivial embedding of objects in typeclasses, but typeclasses can do things objects can’t. The Scala community, however, shows that objects are at least as powerful as typeclasses<sup>1</sup>, since there exists a trivial embedding of typeclasses in objects.</p>

<p>This seems to indicate that the relationship between the two is much more intimate than commonly thought.</p>

","2988","","<p>Yes, given a type system than is expressive and powerful enough, this is indeed possible.</p>

<p><a href=""http://impredicative.com/ur/"" rel=""nofollow"">Ur/Web</a>, for example, is a web application framework written in the Ur programming language, in which several interesting properties are guaranteed by the type system:</p>

<ul>
<li>there cannot be dead links (within the application)</li>
<li>it is impossible to generate invalid HTML</li>
<li>it is impossible to have XSS attacks</li>
<li>SQL injection is impossible</li>
<li>form fields always have a corresponding server-side handler</li>
<li>AJAX calls always have a corresponding server-side handler</li>
<li>the types of client-side form fields, server-side handlers and database tables match up</li>
<li>... a lot more ...</li>

<p>There are also some web frameworks in Haskell, OCaml and Scala that (try to) do (some of) that. Their type systems are powerful enough to guarantee at least some of those properties.

","2988","","<p>Ruby has syntactically lightweight support for literal anonymous procedures (called <em>blocks</em> in Ruby). Therefore, it doesn't need a new language feature for this.</p>

<p>(In general, it is a bad sign, if you need to add language features. You should be able to implement everything in a library, otherwise it is a sign of bad language design.)</p>

<p>So, what you normally do, is to write a method which takes a block of code, allocates the resource, executes the block of code in the context of that resource and then closes the resource.</p>

<p>Something like this:</p>

<pre><code>def with(klass, *args)
  yield r = klass.open(*args)
ensure
  r.close

<p>You could use it like this:</p>

<pre><code>with File, 'temp.txt', 'w' do |f|
  f.write 'hi'
  raise 'spitespite'
end
</code></pre>

<p>However, this is a very procedural way to do this. Ruby is an object-oriented language, which means that the responsibility of properly executing a block of code in the context of a <code>File</code> should belong to the <code>File</code> class:</p>

<pre><code>File.open 'temp.txt', 'w' do |f|
  f.write 'hi'
  raise 'spitespite'
end
</code></pre>

<p>This could be implemented something like this:</p>

<pre><code>def File.open(*args)
  f = new(*args)
  return f unless block_given?
  yield f
ensure
  f.close if block_given?
end
</code></pre>

<p>This is a general pattern that is implemented by lots of classes in the Ruby core library, standard libraries and third-party libraries.</p>

<hr>

<p>A more close correspondence to the generic Python context manager protocol would be:</p>

<pre><code>def with(ctx)
  yield ctx.setup
ensure
  ctx.teardown
end

class File
  def setup; self end
  alias_method :teardown, :close
end

with File.open('temp.txt', 'w') do |f|
  f.write 'hi'
  raise 'spitespite'

"<p>Some time ago I found the <a href=""http://www.igormaznitsa.com/projects/mjvm/index.html"">MJVM</a> project. Sadly, this project has been abandoned by it author (I asked <a href=""http://www.igormaznitsa.com/"">Igor</a> via email).</p>

<p>I wonder if there is a (continued) open source project of a full implementation of a JVM in Java like this one.</p>

<p>By ""full"", I mean, not only to emulate mobile devices.</p>
","2988","","<p>The <a href=""http://JikesRVM.Org/"">Jikes RVM</a> is probably the most prominent JVM implementation written in Java. However, its lowest level implementation simply consists of static method calls to a ""magic"" interface which is treated specially by the compiler and translated into native code.</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://Labs.Oracle.Com/projects/maxine/"">Maxine VM</a> (developed originally by Sun Labs, now Oracle Labs) is a <em>real</em> metacircular VM, in which not only everything is written in Java, but there is no special-casing in the compiler going on. Even more: not only is the Maxine VM written in Java, it even runs <em>in itself</em>! This might sound crazy, and to be frank, I have no idea how that works, but it is based on the <a href=""http://KleinVM.SourceForge.Net/"">Klein VM</a> (developed by Sun Labs) which does the same thing for the Self programming language.</p>

<p>This has some very interesting properties: since the JVM itself is part of the codebase that the JVM interprets, the same codebase that the user code belongs to, this means that it can do optimizations such as inlining across the VM boundary. IOW: it can inline VM code into the user code and vice versa. It also means that the VM itself is subject to the same runtime profiling and dynamic optimizations that&nbsp;&ndash; on other VMs (even including Jikes)&nbsp;&ndash; only the user code is, which means that the VM itself constantly gets re-compiled and re-optimized to adapt to changing loads, new classes being loaded, changing profiles, changing usage patterns and so on.</p>

<p>On VMs like HotSpot, JRockit, J9 and others, these optimizations are impossible, for the simple reason that the JVM only knows how to optimize JVML bytecode, but the VM isn't written in Java. But even in Jikes, this is not possible because, while the VM is written in Java, it gets statically compiled to native code <em>before</em> it runs, and the code of the VM itself is not part of the code that the VM ""sees"".</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://Labs.Oracle.Com/projects/squawk/"">Squawk VM</a> is also a JVM developed by Sun Labs, now Oracle Labs. Unlike Maxine, which is roughly similar to J9, HotSpot or JRockit in its target audience, Squawk is more analogous to the KVM (originally developed by Sun, now Oracle), i.e. targeted at resource-constrained embedded devices. Squawk is also inspired by Klein. Unlike Maxine, it has a small abstraction layer written in C. But keep in mind, that Maxine requires an OS to run, whereas Squawk runs without an OS. So, in a sense, Squawk is even purer than Maxine, because many parts that are not part of Maxine but part of the OS (where they are often implemented in C, C++ or other low-level languages), are actually part of Squawk itself. Device drivers, for example, are written in Java. Only a small hardware abstraction layer and I/O libraries are written in C.</p>

"<p>Objective-J is compiled/transformed into JavaScript directly on the browser. (This is contrast to doing this on the server, as GWT does for Java.) Has this approach been implemented for any language, other than Objective-J?</p>
","2988","","<p>The <a href=""http://CoffeeScript.Org/"">CoffeeScript</a> compiler compiles CoffeeScript into ECMAScript. Since the CoffeeScript compiler is itself written in CoffeeScript, it can compile itself to ECMAScript and thus run in the browser. The necessary bits and pieces to support <code>&lt;script type='text/coffeescript'&gt;</code> elements are already included in the standard CoffeeScript compiler.</p>

<p>In general, <em>any</em> language can be compiled to ECMAScript, all you need is a compiler. And, since <em>any</em> language can be compiled to ECMAScript, any <em>compiler</em> can be compiled to ECMAScript, all you need is a compiler for the language <em>that</em> compiler is written in.</p>

<p>This leads to a combinatorial explosion of possibilities for compiling languages within the browser.</p>

<p>For example, there is this guy who writes <a href=""http://ClueCC.SourceForge.Net/"">C compilers which target high-level languages</a> for fun. He has a compiler that compiles C to Java, Perl, Common Lisp, Lua or ECMAScript. So, you can use <em>that</em> compiler to compile any <em>other</em> compiler written in C to ECMAScript. And most languages have some compiler somewhere which is written in C.</p>

<p>Clue is written in C. Clue compiles C to ECMAScript. Ergo, you can use Clue to compile Clue to ECMAScript. Then, you can run Clue in the browser to compile C to ECMAScript on the fly. <code>&lt;script type='text/c'&gt;</code>, anyone? (Fun thought: node.js is written in C. Hmm &hellip;)</p>

<p>On a more serious note: there are generally three reasons for compiling to ECMAScript:</p>

<ol>
<li>reuse</li>
<li><a href=""http://StackOverflow.Com/questions/3848521/"">safety</a></li>
<li>expressivity</li>
</ol>

<p>If you simply want to reuse existing code written in a different language (or existing knowlwedge in a different language), then compiling/interpreting on the client doesn't make much sense. The code or the coder doesn't expect to be able to use <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> elements anyway. This category includes stuff like <a href=""http://Google-Web-Toolkit.GoogleCode.Com/"">GWT</a> or <a href=""http://Wikipedia.Org/wiki/Microsoft_Live_Labs_Volta"">Volta</a>.</p>

<p>If (type-)safety is your goal, then compiling/interpreting on the client simply doesn't work: how can you guarantee safety if you don't control the compiler? That's why <a href=""http://Impredicative.Com/ur/"">Ur/Web</a>, <a href=""http://Groups.Inf.Ed.Ac.Uk/links/"">Links</a>, <a href=""http://Flapjax-Lang.Org/"">Flapjax</a>, <a href=""http://haXe.Org/"">haXe</a>, <a href=""http://Google-Caja.GoogleCode.Com/"">Caja</a> and such compile the code on the server. They guarantee safety either by static typing or tight integration or both. (By tight integration I mean that backend, frontend and app are tightly connected, by e.g. specifying data structures <em>once</em> and then generating the corresponding SQL, ECMAScript and HTML forms from that single source to make sure that they all match up. It should be obvious why this requires processing on the server.)</p>

<p>The ones that focus on expressivity, however, expect to be used as a replacement for ECMAScript, i.e. inside <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> elements, and thus they often come with interpreters and/or compilers which run on the client.

"<p>I ran into this question many times ago and have seen the terms again and didn't know their real concept in computer engineering.</p>

<p>What do platform and framework refer to?</p>

<p>I see many terms like platform-independent and development platforms, and also same for frameworks, but i can't quietly understand them. Do they refer to libraries? do they refer to different kinds of Operating-System? </p>
","2988","","<p>The term <em>framework</em> is very well defined: a framework is very similar to a library, except that Control is Inverted. (Inversion Of Control is <em>the</em> defining characteristic of what constitutes a framework.) IOW: <em>you</em> call a library, but a framework calls you.</p>

<p>Another way to think about it, is that <em>you</em> write an application, but leave all the un-interesting details blank and use libraries to fill them. A framework OTOH <em>is</em> an application. It is an application which has all the <em>interesting</em> details left blank for <em>you</em> to fill in. (Of course, in the code you use to fill in the blanks you can in turn call libraries yourself. Also, the framework itself will call libraries to implement <em>its</em> inner workings. And, frameworks usually come bundled with a rich set of libraries which are tightly integrated with the framework. However, the distinction is still clear. Just because the framework and the libraries ship together in one package doesn't mean there is no distinction.)</p>

<p>The term <em>platform</em>, however, is not so well defined. It is also heavily overloaded. In the context of porting native applications, it usually refers to the combination of CPU ISA (e.g. x86, AMD64, IA-64, POWER, MIPS, ARMv9, Sparc), hardware architecture (PC, CHRP, PReP, Mac), kernel (Linux, NT) and base libraries (POSIX, Win32, Core Foundation).</p>

<p>In the broader context of software development, ""platform"" usually literally means ""that which your code stands on"". For a native application, that could be basically the same as above, for a JVM application it could be the JVM plus the JRE plus OSGI.</p>

<p>Basically, you can take the metaphor quite literal: a platform allows you (i.e. your code) to stand on higher ground than you could without it.</p>

"<p>I've heard great things about JRuby and I know you can run it without knowing any Java. My development skills are strong, Java is just not one of the tools I know. It's a massive tool with a myriad of accompanying tools such as Maven/Ant/JUnit etc.</p>

<p>Is it worth moving my current Rails applications to JRuby for performance reasons alone? Perhaps if I pick up some basic Java along side, there can be so added benefits that aren't obvious such as better debugging/performance optimization tools?</p>

<p>Would love some advice on this one.</p>
","2988","","<p>I think you pretty much nailed it.</p>

<p>JRuby is just yet another Ruby execution engine, just like MRI, YARV, IronRuby, Rubinius, MacRuby, MagLev, SmallRuby, Ruby.NET, XRuby, RubyGoLightly, tinyrb, HotRuby, BlueRuby, Red Sun and all the others.</p>

<p>The main differences are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>portability: for example, YARV is only officially supported on x86 32 Bit Linux. It is not supported on OSX or Windows or 64 Bit Linux. Rubinius only works on Unix, not on Windows. JRuby OTOH runs <em>everywhere</em>: desktops, servers, phones, App Engine, you name it. It runs on the Oracle JDK, OpenJDK, IBM J9, Apple SoyLatte, RedHat IcedTea and Oracle JRockit JVMs (and probably a couple of others I forgot about) and also on the Dalvik VM. It runs on Windows, Linux, OSX, Solaris, several BSDs, other proprietary and open Unices, OpenVMS and several mainframe OSs, Android and Google App Engine. In fact, on Windows, JRuby passes more RubySpec tests than ""Ruby"" (meaning MRI or YARV) itself!</p></li>
<li><p>extensibility: Ruby programs running on JRuby can use any arbitrary Java library. Through JRuby-FFI, they can also use any arbitrary C library. And with the new C extension support in JRuby 1.6, they can even use a large subset of MRI and YARV C extensions, like Mongrel for example. (And note that ""Java"" or ""C"" library does not actually mean written in those languages, it only means with a Java or C API. They could be written in Scala or Clojure or C++ or Haskell.)</p></li>
<li><p>tooling: whenever someone writes a new tool for YARV or MRI (like e.g. memprof), it turns out that JRuby already had a tool 5 years ago which does the same thing, only better. The Java ecosystem has some of the best tools for ""runtime behavior comprehension"" (which is a term I just made up, by which I mean much more than just simple profiling, I mean tools for deeply understanding what exactly your program does at runtime, what its performance characteristics are, where the bottlenecks are, where the memory is going, and most importantly <em>why</em> all of that is happening) and visualization available on the market, and pretty much all of those work with JRuby, at least to some extent.</p></li>
<li><p>deployment: assuming that your target system already has a JVM installed, deploying a JRuby app (and I'm not just talking about Rails, I also mean desktop, mobile, other kinds of servers) is literally just copying one JAR (or WAR) and a double-click.</p></li>
<li><p>performance: JRuby has much higher startup overhead. In return you get much higher throughput. In practice, this means that deploying a Rails app to JRuby is a good idea, as is running your integration tests, but for developer unit tests and scripts, MRI, YARV or Rubinius are better choices. Note that many Rails developers simply develop and unit test on MRI and integration test and deploy on JRuby. There's no need to choose a single execution engine for everything.</p></li>
<li><p>concurrency: JRuby runs Ruby threads concurrently. This means two things: if your locking is correct, your program will run faster, and if your locking is incorrect, your program will break. (Unfortunately, neither MRI nor YARV nor Rubinius run threads concurrently, so there's still some broken multithreaded Ruby code out there that doesn't know it's broken, because obviously concurrency bugs can only show up if there's actual concurrency.)</p></li>
<li><p>platforms (this is somewhat related to portability): there are some amazing Java platforms out there, e.g. the Azul JCA with 768 GiBytes of RAM and 864 CPU cores specifically designed for memory-safe, pointer-safe, garbage-collected, object-oriented languages. Android. Google App Engine. All of those run JRuby.</p></li>

"<p>I have <strong>very</strong> little experience in web development, so this may be a very basic question.</p>

<p>It's just, from the limited experience I <em>do</em> have (a little PHP, and a little Ruby on Rails), it seems that the way dynamically generated HTML is <em>formatted</em> just ""doesn't matter""; it ends up ugly, with weird indentation, and nobody cares because that isn't what the <em>users</em> sees.</p>

<p>Unless, of course, the user is a developer, or even just someone who's curious to look at a little HTML to try and learn something.</p>

<p>Maybe you don't know what I'm talking about; so let me give an example.</p>

<p>In a Ruby file I might have some code like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;h1&gt;Heading&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;%= render :partial =&gt; '/layouts/body' %&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then, in my ""/layouts/_body.html.erb"" file, I might have this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;Here is some content!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;List item 1&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;List item 2&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;List item 3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>When all this gets rendered, it'll look fine. But if the user tries to view the source, the HTML will look pretty crappy:</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;h1&gt;Heading&lt;/h1&gt;

    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Here is some content!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;List item 1&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;List item 2&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;List item 3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously, this is not a big deal. And I can totally understand if the prevailing opinion is simply ""It doesn't matter."" But is that just the way it has to be? Does the readability of HTML not matter to anyone?</p>

<p>I'm just curious to know if this ever bugged anyone else enough for him/her to come up with a ""solution"" for it (obviously it would have to be someone who viewed it as a ""problem"" in the first place).</p>

","2988","","<p>You really shouldn't be using the <code>mswin32</code> versions of Ruby (aka. One-Click Installer). They are obsolete. They are compiled with Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 (aka MSVC6), which was released in 1998(!). Code compiled with MSVC6 is incompatible with code compiled with both GCC and newer versions of MSVC. It is much slower, since a lot has happened in the area of compiler optimizations research in the last 12 years.</p>

<p>Because of the incompatibilities, all libraries that Ruby uses, all C extensions, all libraries that the C extensions use and so on, have to <em>also</em> be compiled with MSVC6. However, MSVC6 isn't even available anymore. Also, many open source projects only test for compatibility with GCC, not MSVC (and certainly not a version of MSVC that has been obsolete for almost a decade).</p>

<p>Use the <code>mingw32</code> versions (aka. <a href=""http://RubyInstaller.Org/"" rel=""nofollow"">RubyInstaller</a>) instead. They are compiled with GCC 3.4 or 4.5 (the (almost) latest version). With the optional DevKit, you can install <em>any</em> C extension, without the author of the gem having to provide a pre-compiled version; the gem just gets compiled on your local machine, just like it would under Linux or OSX.</p>

<p>Are you sure you have a 64 Bit build of Ruby? Like I wrote above, the <code>mswin</code> versions are usually compiled with MSVC6, which came out in 1998. AMD64 was only announced in 1999, the spec wasn't finished until 2000 and the first processors didn't appear until 2003, so, unless Microsoft has time-travel technology, it is simply impossible for a 64 Bit version of MSVC6 to even exist!</p>

<p>As far as I know, there are no pre-compiled versions of Ruby for 64 Bit Windows available. The RubyInstaller developers have only just started working on a 64 Bit <code>mingw</code> build.</p>

<p>If you compiled Ruby yourself, you should use <code>--platform=ruby</code> to force the Gems being compiled on you local system, since the pre-compiled <code>mswin32</code> Gems which are available are all incompatible with your system, since they are a) 32 Bit and b) compiled with MSVC6 which is incompatible with whatever compiler you used.</p>

</ul>

<p>As was already mentioned in several other answers, the distinction can be confusing in C++, since both Generic Programming  and (static/compile time) Metaprogramming are done with Templates. To confuse you even further, Generic Programming in C++ actually uses Metaprogramming to be efficient, i.e. Template Specialization generates specialized (fast) programs from generic ones.</p>

<p>Also note that, as every Lisp programmer knows, code and data are the same thing, so there really is no such thing as ""metaprogramming"", it's all just programming. Again, this is a bit hard to see in C++, since you actually use two completely different programming languages for programming (C++, an imperative, procedural, object-oriented language in the C family) and metaprogramming (Templates, a purely functional ""accidental"" language somewhere in between pure lambda calculus and Haskell, with butt-ugly syntax, since it was never actually intended to <em>be</em> a programming language.)</p>

"<p>I need to know a correct name for this cool feature that some languages provide.</p>

<p>FYI: In some languages it is possible to do a multiple assignments by assigning a structure of values to a structure of ""variables"". In the example in the question title it assigns ""foo"" to foo and ""bar"" to bar.</p>
","2988","","<p>It's generally called <em>destructuring bind</em> in functional languages (which don't <em>have</em> assignments) and <em>destructuring assignment</em> in imperative languages.</p>

<p>Some languages provide subsets of that feature and then call it something different. For example, in Python it works with Tuples, Lists or Sequences and is called <em>Tuple unpacking</em>, <em>List unpacking</em> or <em>Sequence unpacking</em>, in Ruby, it works with Arrays (or objects that are convertible to an array) and is called <em>parallel assignment</em>.</p>

<p>Destructuring bind can get arbitrarily complex. E.g. this (imaginary) bind</p>

<pre><code>[Integer(a), b, 2, c] = some_array
</code></pre>

<p>would assign the first element of <code>some_array</code> to <code>a</code>, the second element to <code>b</code> and the fourth element to <code>c</code>, but <em>only</em> if the first element is an <code>Integer</code>, the third element is equal to <code>2</code> and the length is 4. So, this even incorporates some conditional logic.</p>

<p>Destructuring bind is a subset of more general <em>pattern matching</em>, which is a standard feature of functional languages like Haskell, ML, OCaml, F#, Erlang and Scala. The difference is that destructuring bind only lets you take apart a structure and bind its components to variables, whereas pattern matching also matches on values inside those structures and lets you make decisions and in particular lets you run arbitrary code in the context of the bindings. (You can see the above imaginary bind as half-way in between destructuring bind and pattern matching.)</p>

<p>Here's the classical example of a <code>reverse</code> function in an imaginary language, written using pattern matching:</p>

<pre><code>def reverse(l: List): List {
  match l {
    when []              { return [] }
    when [first :: rest] { return (reverse(rest) :: first) }
  }

"<p>I'm reading <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/193435631X"">Programming Scala</a>. At the beginning of chapter 4, the author comments that Java supports static methods, which are ""not-so-pure OO concepts."" Why is this so?</p>
","2988","","<p>Object-orientation is about three things:</p>

<ul>
<li>messaging,</li>
<li>local retention and protection and hiding of state-process, and</li>
<li>extreme late-binding of all things.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of those three, the most important one is <em>messaging</em>.</p>

<p>Static methods violate at least messaging and late-binding.</p>

<p>The idea of <em>messaging</em> means that in OO, computation is performed by networks of self-contained objects which send messages to each other. Sending a message is the <em>only</em> way of communication/computation.</p>

<p>Static methods don't do that. They aren't associated with any object. They really aren't methods <em>at all</em>, according to the usual definition. They are really just procedures. There's pretty much no difference between a Java static method <code>Foo.bar</code> and a BASIC subroutine <code>FOO_BAR</code>.</p>

<p>As for late-binding: a more modern name for that is <em>dynamic dispatch</em>. Static methods violate that, too, in fact, it's even in their very name: <em>static</em> methods.</p>

<p>Static methods break some very nice properties of object-orientation. For example, object-oriented systems are automatically capability-safe with objects acting as capabilities. Static methods (or really <em>any</em> statics, be that static state or static methods) break that property.</p>

<p>You can also execute every object in parallel in its own process, since they only communicate via messaging, thus providing some trivial concurrency. (Like <em>Actors</em>, basically, which shouldn't be too surprising, since Carl Hewitt created the Actor Model based on Smalltalk-71, and Alan Kay created Smalltalk-71 partially based on PLANNER, which in turn was created by Carl Hewitt. The close relationship between actors and objects is far from coincidental, in fact, they are essentially one and the same.) Again, statics (both static methods, and <em>especially</em> static state) break that nice property.</p>

"<p><strong>Short version:</strong>  The default <code>inspect</code> method for a class displays the object's address.*  How can I do this in a custom <code>inspect</code> method of my own?</p>

<p>*(To be clear, I want the 8-digit hex number you would normally get from <code>inspect</code>.  I don't care about the actual memory address.  I'm just calling it a memory address because it <em>looks</em> like one.  I know Ruby is memory-safe.)</p>

<p><strong>Long version:</strong>  I have two classes, <code>Thing</code> and <code>ThingList</code>.  <code>ThingList</code> is a subclass of <code>Array</code> specifically designed to hold Things.  Due to the nature of Things and the way they are used in my program, Things have an instance variable <code>@container</code> that points back to the <code>ThingList</code> that holds the <code>Thing</code>.</p>

<p>It is possible for two Things to have exactly the same data. Therefore, when I'm debugging the application, the only way I can reliably differentiate between two Things is to use <code>inspect</code>, which displays their address.  When I <code>inspect</code> a <code>Thing</code>, however, I get pages upon pages of output because <code>inspect</code> will recursively inspect <code>@container</code>, causing every Thing in the list to be inspected as well!</p>

<p>All I need is the first part of that output.  How can I write a custom <code>inspect</code> method on <code>Thing</code> that will just display this?</p>

<pre><code>#&lt;Thing:0xb7727704&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>  I just realized that the default <code>to_s</code> does exactly this.  I didn't notice this earlier because I have a custom <code>to_s</code> that provides human-readable details about the object.</p>

<p>Assume that I cannot use <code>to_s</code>, and that I must write a custom <code>inspect</code>.</p>
","2988","","<p>This is impossible. There is no way in Ruby to get the memory address of an object, since Ruby is a memory-safe language which has (by design) no methods for accessing memory directly. In fact, in many implementations of Ruby, objects don't even <em>have</em> a memory address. And in most of the implementations that <em>do</em> map objects directly to memory, the memory address potentially changes after every garbage collection.</p>

<p>The reason why using the memory address as an identifier in current versions of MRI and YARV accidentally works, is because they have a crappy garbage collector implementation that never defragments memory. All other implementations have garbage collectors which <em>do</em> defragment memory, and thus move objects around in memory, thereby changing their address.</p>

<p>If you tie your implementation to the memory address, your code will only ever work on slow implementations with crappy garbage collectors. And it isn't even guaranteed that MRI and YARV will always have crappy garbage collectors, in fact, in both implementations the garbage collector has been identified as one of <em>the</em> major performance bottlenecks and it is safe to assume that there <em>will</em> be changes to the garbage collectors. There are already some major changes to YARV's garbage collector in the SVN, which will be part of YARV 1.9.3 and YARV 2.0.</p>

"<p>here's a short question that my googling failed to deliver any clues on.</p>

<p>It seems to be pretty commonplace to use the word ""res"" for one of the indexes in function arguments. Its existence appears to be agnostic to whatever programming language you look at.</p>

<p>What does it stand for? A simple guess would be, ""resource"", perhaps? If this is spot on, it would be nice if someone who feels pedagogically inclined, would care to help me shed some light on this. What I don't grok, in particular, is when and why there's a use for the meaning, ""resource"" (granted that this is the actual meaning of ""res"").</p>

<p><strong>Edit 1:</strong> I'm providing a random example, this is from the <a href=""http://nodejs.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">NodeJS.org</a> homepage:</p>

<p><code>var http = require('http');<br/>
http.createServer(function (req, <strong>res</strong>) {<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>res</strong>.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>res</strong>.end('Hello World\n');<br/>
}).listen(8124, ""127.0.0.1"");<br/>
console.log('Server running at <a href=""http://127.0.0.1:8124/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://127.0.0.1:8124/</a>');</code></p>

<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> I first came across the ""res"" thing while working with a PHP backend developer on a fairly modded WP instance. At the time things were too hectic to really sort out what he meant in his quick explanation, but he seemed to scatter the word all around, in arguments and $res variable calls alike. It's obviously impossible to comment on individual programmers' style and preference of coding, but I'm mostly curious to know if there's some sort of untold consensus among programmers – and <em>if there's a single purpose</em> – using a so called ""res"" pointer. (Compare eg. with using <code>i</code> for ""iterator"" as often used in loops.)</p>

<p>The reason why you get an error here is <em>not</em> that unitialized local variables don't evaluate to <code>nil</code>, it is that <code>fnord</code> is ambiguous: it could be <em>either</em> an argument-less message send to the default receiver (i.e. equivalent to <code>self.fnord()</code>) <em>or</em> an access to the local variable <code>fnord</code>.</p>

<p>In order to disambiguate that, you need to add a receiver or an argument list (even if empty) to tell Ruby that it is a message send:</p>

<pre><code>self.fnord
# NoMethodError: undefined method `fnord' for main:Object
fnord()
# NoMethodError: undefined method `fnord' for main:Object
</code></pre>

<p>or make sure that the <em>parser</em> (<em>not</em> the evaluator) parses (<em>not</em> executes) an assignment before the usage, to tell Ruby that it is a local variable:</p>

<pre><code>if false
  fnord = 42

fnord              #=&gt; nil

<p>It's not, actually. It's treated the same as a local variable. The class hierarchy variable is the one that behaves differently, local variables, instance variables and global variables all behave the same.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>is there other reasons &hellip; can't class variables behave like that too?</p>

<p>I don't know. For instance variables it is very convenient, since unlike in Java, for example, where instance variables are declared in the class definition und thus always exist for every instance of the class, in Ruby, instance variables aren't declared anywhere. They just magically spring into existence, as soon as they are assigned. Since instance variables aren't necessarily guaranteed to exist, writing methods that use instance variables would be a pain if they threw exceptions.</p>

<p>Why class hierarchy variables are different, I have no idea. Maybe it's because nobody uses them anyway, or because they generally tend to be initialized in the class body and simply aren't accessed when they are not initialized.</p>

  <p>Is it because the <code>do</code> of the <code>while</code> syntax is just syntaxic sugar and as nothing to do with the <code>do</code> of a block?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>More or less, yes. It's not syntactic sugar, it's simply a built-in language construct, like <code>def</code> or <code>class</code>, as @meagar already wrote.</p>

<p>It has nothing to do with the <code>do</code> of a block, except that keywords are expensive and so reusing keywords makes sense. (By ""expensive"" I mean that they limit the programmer in his expressiveness.)</p>

<p>In a <code>while</code> loop, there are two ways to separate the block from the condition:</p>

<ol>
<li>the <code>do</code> keyword and</li>
<li>an expression separator.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are, in turn, two different expression separators in Ruby:</p>

<ol>
<li>the semicolon <code>;</code> and</li>
<li>a newline</li>
</ol>

<p>So, all three of the following are valid:</p>

<pre><code>while i = a.shift do puts i end # do

while i = a.shift; puts i end   # semicolon

while i = a.shift
  puts i end                    # newline
</code></pre>

<p>[Obviously, that last one wouldn't be written that way, you would put the <code>end</code> on a new line, dedented to match the <code>while</code>. I just wanted to demonstrate what is the minimum needed to separate the parts of the <code>while</code> loop.]</p>

<p>By the way: it is highly un-idiomatic to put the condition in parentheses. There's also a lot of superfluous semicolons in your code. And the variable name <code>i</code> is usually reserved for an index, not an element. (I normally use <code>el</code> for generic elements, but I much prefer more semantic names.)</p>

<p>It is also highly un-idiomatic to iterate a collection manually. Your code would be much better written as</p>

<pre><code>a.each(&amp;method(:puts)).clear
</code></pre>

<p>Not only is it much easier to understand what this does (print all elements of the array and delete all items from it), it is also much easier to write (there is no way to get the termination condition wrong, or screw up any assignments). It also happens to be more efficient: your version is &Theta;(n<sup>2</sup>), this one is &Theta;(n).</p>

<p>And actually, that's not really how you would write it, either, because <code>Kernel#puts</code> already implements that behavior, anyway. So, what you would <em>really</em> write is this</p>

<pre><code>puts a
a.clear
</code></pre>

<p>or maybe this</p>

<pre><code>a.tap(&amp;method(:puts)).clear
</code></pre>

<p>[Note: this very last one is not 100% equivalent. It prints a newline for an empty array, all the other ones print nothing.]</p>

<p>Simple. Clear. Concise. Expressive. Fast.</p>

<p>Compare that to:</p>

<pre><code>while (i = a.shift) do; puts i ; end

"<p>As the title states, does Ruby allow Cartesian product types? I can't find anything on it anywhere.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
","2988","","<p>Ruby doesn't allow types <em>at all</em>, at least not in the sense that you seem to be using the word ""type"". Therefore, it obviously doesn't support product types, either.</p>

<p>Ruby is a so-called ""dynamically typed"" language (using the pragmatic, programmer-jargon definition of the word ""type"") or an untyped language (using the mathematical, type-theoretic definition), so talking about ""product types"" simply doesn't make sense at all.</p>

<p>Or, if you want to, you can see a dynamically typed language as a statically typed language with only a single type which is the sum type of all dynamic types.</p>

<p>However, you <em>can</em> obviously construct <em>values</em> that <em>would</em> have a product type if Ruby had types <em>at all</em>:</p>

<pre><code>class Tuple
  include Enumerable; include Comparable

  class &lt;&lt; self
    alias_method :[], :new

    def call(length)
      class_name = :""Tuple#{length}""
      return const_get class_name if const_defined? class_name
      const_set class_name, Class.new(self) {
        (@length = length).times do |i| define_method :""_#{i+1}"" do @ary[i] end end
      }
    end
  end

  def to_s; ""(#{@ary.join(', ')})"" end
  def inspect; ""#&lt;#{self.class} (#{@ary.map(&amp;:inspect).join(', ')})&gt;"" end
  def to_a; @ary.dup end
  def [](*args) @ary[*args] end
  def each(*args, &amp;block) @ary.each(*args, &amp;block) end

  def &lt;=&gt;(other)
    raise TypeError unless other.is_a? self.class
    raise TypeError unless each_with_index.all? {|el, i| other.instance_variable_get(:@ary)[i].instance_of?(el.class) }
    map.with_index {|el, i| el &lt;=&gt; other.instance_variable_get(:@ary)[i] }.find(0) {|cmp| !cmp.zero? }
  end

  def initialize(*args)
    raise ArgumentError unless args.length == self.class.instance_variable_get(:@length)
    (@ary = args).freeze
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>This will give you a way to construct n-Tuples, which of course are special cases of product types. For example, this:</p>

<pre><code>t3 = Tuple.(3)[1, :two, 'three']

"<p>Is it possible to add a core method to the Module class in Ruby?  I want to do something like this (messed around with the idea yesterday, just whipped this together in a second):</p>

<p>This works!  Thanks @Jörg W Mittag.  Makes it much easier to read for Rails <code>has_many</code> and such:</p>

<pre><code>class Module
  def base(&amp;block)
    metaclass = class &lt;&lt; self; self; end
    # add the method using define_method instead of def x.say so we can use a closure
    metaclass.send :define_method, :included do |base|
      base.class_eval(&amp;block) unless block.nil?
      base.class_eval &lt;&lt;-EOF
        extend  #{name}::ClassMethods
        include #{name}::InstanceMethods
      EOF
    end
    block
  end
end

<p>Like this example:</p>

<pre><code>module UserRoleBehavior
  base do

    has_many :roles, :through =&gt; :user_roles
  end

  module ClassMethods
    # ...

end

class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  include UserRoleBehavior

","2988","","<p>If you want to add a method to the <code>Module</code> class, you simply add a method to the <code>Module</code> class:</p>

<pre><code>class Module
  def base
    # ...
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>In your code, you were using</p>

<pre><code>def self.base
  # ...
end
</code></pre>

<p>This syntax (<code>def foo.bar</code>) is the syntax for adding a singleton method named <code>bar</code> to the object referenced by <code>foo</code>, which is actually really just adding a regular instance method to the singleton class of the object referenced by <code>foo</code>.</p>

<p>So, in your code you were adding a singleton method named <code>base</code> to the object referenced by <code>self</code>, which inside of <code>class_eval</code> is the class object itself, in this case <code>Module</code>. The reason why singleton methods are <em>called</em> singleton methods, is because they only exist on a single object. In your case, the method <code>base</code> exists only on the object <code>Module</code>, not on any other object, and in particular not on the object <code>User</code>. In other words: the <em>only</em> way to call the <code>base</code> method is as <code>Module.base</code>, because that is the only object that you added it to.</p>

<p>It took me quite a while to wade through your three(!) nested <code>class_eval</code>s to find out what it is that you are trying to achieve. Which wasn't made easier by the fact that your code doesn't even actually work, even <em>if</em> defined on the correct class, because <code>def</code> creates a new scope, and so <code>block</code> is undefined in the innermost <code>class_eval</code>.</p>

<p>Apparently, what you are trying to do is this:</p>

<pre><code>class Module
  def base(&amp;block)
    define_singleton_method(:included) do |base|
      base.class_eval(&amp;block)
    end

<p>That depends on your definition of ""object-oriented"".</p>

<p>For example, according to Alan Kay, who coined the word ""object-oriented"", the only object-oriented languages today are Smalltalk and Lisp. I assume that he probably also would include Self, Newspeak, Io, Ioke, Seph and Erlang, but definitely not Java.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why its called as  fully object oriented or partially?</p>

<p>You would have to ask the people who call it that.</p>

<li><p>Is this of any benefit to Scala - the language? Is this making Scala more ""powerful"" in some way compared languages without a Turing complete type system?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I guess this applies to languages and type systems in general.</p>
","2988","","<p>There is a blog post somewhere with a type-level implementation of the SKI combinator calculus, which is known to be Turing-complete.</p>

<p>Turing-complete type systems have basically the same benefits and drawbacks that Turing-complete languages have: you can do anything, but you can prove very little. In particular, you cannot prove that you will actually eventually do something.</p>

<p>One example of type-level computation are the new type-preserving collection transformers in Scala 2.8. In Scala 2.8, methods like <code>map</code>, <code>filter</code> and so on are guaranteed to return a collection of the same type that they were called on. So, if you <code>filter</code> a <code>Set[Int]</code>, you get back a <code>Set[Int]</code> and if you <code>map</code> a <code>List[String]</code> you get back a <code>List[Whatever the return type of the anonymous function is]</code>.</p>

<p>Now, as you can see, <code>map</code> can actually transform the element type. So, what happens if the new element type cannot be represented with the original collection type? Example: a <code>BitSet</code> can only contain fixed-width integers. So, what happens if you have a <code>BitSet[Short]</code> and you map each number to its string representation?</p>

<pre><code>someBitSet map { _.toString() }
</code></pre>

<p>The result <em>would</em> be a <code>BitSet[String]</code>, but that's impossible. So, Scala chooses the most derived supertype of <code>BitSet</code>, which can hold a <code>String</code>, which in this case is a <code>Set[String]</code>.</p>

<p>All of this computation is going on during <em>compile time</em>, or more precisely during <em>type checking time</em>, using type-level functions. Thus, it is statically guaranteed to be type-safe, even though the types are actually computed and thus not known at design time.</p>

"<p>In OOP, there are entities (e.g. Person) which has attributes (e.g. name, address, etc) and it has methods. How do you describe <code>new</code>? Is it a method or just special token to bring an abstract entity to real one?</p>

","2988","","<p>There are plenty of languages that have module systems. Three that spring to mind immediately are the module system of Standard ML, the unit system of Racket and the module system of Newspeak.</p>

<p>Those three are by some people regarded as either more powerful or better designed (or both) than OSGi or similar systems.</p>

<p>I specifically like the Newspeak module system, because of its incredible simplicity. In fact, Newspeak doesn't even really <em>have</em> a module system, it just turns out that if you take object-orientation <em>seriously</em>, classes automatically become module definitions, and objects automatically become modules.</p>

<p>This is a refreshing contrast to other module systems like Standard ML's, Racket's or OSGi's, which typically are <em>insanely</em> complex. Here is a nice and funny quote by Jonathan Shapiro, the designer of the BitC programming language about designing a module system:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The ML module system is fully understood only by David MacQueen, and only on alternating weeks. The Scheme module system required the combined brilliance of Matt Flatt and Matthias Felleisen (and six revisions of the language standard) to achieve.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And when Simon Peyton Jones, one of the designers of Haskell, was asked why Haskell has only such a basic module system, he said that they didn't feel they were smart enough to design a real one. Let that sink in ... The <em>designers of Haskell</em>. <em>Not smart</em>.</p>

<p>Newspeak's design is utterly brilliant: in object-orientation, everything is a message send (in Java-speak that's a (non-static) method call, in C++-speak that's a virtual function call). In most object-oriented languages that is unfortunately not true. You have variables, fields, constants, non-virtual functions, static methods, a class dictionary, a package dictionary, and so on. Accessing any of those is not done via a message send, but via some other means.</p>

<p>Not so on Newspeak: in Newspeak, everything is a message send. Even the superclass of a class is a message send. (I.e.: if I write <code>class Foo extends Bar</code> in Newspeak, then <code>Bar</code> is <em>not</em> a reference to the class itself, it is just calling a method named <code>Bar</code>, which will then return a class. Which BTW means that you can override superclasses in subclasses, which is pretty mindblowing.)</p>

<p>This means that top-level classes cannot have a superclass: since the superclass is message send, where would you send it to? In a top-level class, you can only call methods that are defined in the class itself: you cannot call methods from the enclosing scope, because in a top-level class, there <em>is no</em> enclosing scope. And you cannot call methods inherited from a superclass, because in order to <em>declare</em> a superclass, you would need to call a method, but you can only call methods defined <em>inside</em> the class.</p>

<p>Now, this is isn't very useful, so classes have class initializers, which allow you to inject objects (and classes are objects) into a class. And this is the <em>only</em> way to inject dependencies into the class, ergo the class initializer functions as a module dependency specification.</p>

<p>On the flip side, if the only way to do something is via message sending, then the internals of a class are automatically private, its functionality can only be achieved by calling public methods. Ergo, the public methods function as a module interface specification.</p>

<p>A couple of other cool features also fall out naturally from this. Features that many other module systems don't have: since a module is really just a class, you can have multiple instances of a module, just call the constructor multiple times like you would with any other class. In a lot of other module systems, modules are singletons.</p>

<p>And, you can pass in arguments to the constructor, thus providing you with parameterized modules, which is typically only supported by very advanced module systems, if at all.</p>

"<p>I have a directed graph data structure, where I am trying to implement individual version control for each vertex. This creates some interesting scenarios, and I would much appreciate any ideas that you guys have. Specifically, I am looking to resolve the default behavior of the system when encountering the stated scenarios.</p>

<p>See the following image: <a href=""http://bayimg.com/faAGCaADD"" rel=""nofollow"">Graph versions</a></p>

<p><strong>Scenario 1: ""The Null Pointer Paradox""</strong></p>

<p>Vertex A is rolled back to version 1.0. Since this rollback will cascade down its subgraph, C will no longer be pointing to D. This could create a hazard. Should the behavior be to:</p>

<ul>
<li>1.1: Delete the edge C -> D, creating a broken graph</li>
<li>1.2: Delete D, leaving E orphaned</li>
<li>1.3: Delete D and E</li>
<li>1.4: Refuse to perform the rollback before all edges pointing to D (which would be E -> D in this case) are deleted</li>
<li>1.X: Alternative solutions?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Scenario 2: ""Indirect Effects""</strong></p>

<p>Vertex D is updated, so that the following holds:</p>

<ul>
<li>D is now version 1.2</li>
<li>E is now version 1.1</li>
<li>C is now version 1.3</li>
<li>A is now version 1.3</li>
</ul>

<p>Vertex A is now rolled back to version 1.2, so that the following holds:</p>

<ul>
<li>A is now version 1.2</li>
<li>C is now version 1.2</li>
<li>D is now version 1.1</li>
</ul>

<p>Should the default behavior be to:</p>

<ul>
<li>2.1: Roll back E to 1.0</li>
<li>2.2: Refuse to roll back due to version hazard, in effect impairing functionality</li>
<li>2.X: Alternative solutions?</li>
</ul>
","2988","","<p>It seems to me that there is some confusion about the granularity here. If you only version individual vertices but not the graph, then rolling back an individual vertex should not affect the rest of the graph. If, OTOH, you <em>want</em> the whole graph to be rolled back, then you should also version the whole graph.</p>

<p>The problem is that if you only version individual vertices, then you only have integrity guarantees for individual vertices, but not for the graph as a whole. So, if, as you describe it, rolling back an individual vertex ""ripples through"" the whole graph (or at least the connected subgraph), then you are not guaranteed to end up in a consistent state.</p>

<p>The research that seems to be closest to what you are trying, is about version control for XML, which, however, only deals with strongly typed trees (IOW degenerate graphs), not general graphs.</p>

"<p>In popular programming speak, what is the difference between these terms and what are the overlaps?</p>

<p>Any related terms I'm missing out?</p>
","2988","","<p>All three of those provide functionality.</p>

<p>However, there are important differences.</p>

<p>A <strong>library</strong> is <em>just</em> a collection of related functionality. Nothing more, but also nothing less. The defining characteristic of a library is that <em>you</em> are in control, <em>you</em> call the library.</p>

<p>The defining characteristic of a <strong>framework</strong> is <em>Inversion of Control</em>. The framework calls <em>you</em>, not the other way round. (This is known as the <em>Hollywood Principle</em>: ""Don't call us, we'll call you."") The framework is in control. The flow of control and the flow of data is managed by the framework.</p>

<p>You can think of it this way: in both cases, you have an application, and this application has holes in it, where code has been left out, and these holes need to be filled in. The difference between a library and a framework is</p>

<ul>
<li>who writes the application,</li>
<li>what are the holes and</li>
<li>who fills in the holes.</li>
</ul>

<p>With a library, <em>you</em> write the application, and you leave out the <em>boring</em> details, which gets filled in by a <em>library</em>.</p>

<p>With a framework, the <em>framework writer</em> writes the application, and leaves out the <em>interesting</em> details, which <em>you</em> fill in.</p>

<p>This can be a little confusing at times, because the framework itself might also contain boring details, that the framework author filled in with libraries, the parts that you write might contain boring details, that you fill in with libraries, and the framework might provide a set of bundled libraries that either work well with the framework or that are often needed in conjunction with the framework. For example, you might use an XML generator library when writing a web application using a web framework, and that XML library might have been provided by the framework or even be an integral part of it.</p>

<p>That doesn't mean, however, that there is no distinction between a library and a framework. The distinction is very clear: Inversion of Control is what it's all about.</p>

<p>The defining characteristic of a <strong>module</strong> is <em>information hiding</em>. A module has an <em>interface</em>, which explicitly, but abstractly specifies both the functionality it provides as well as the functionality it depends on. (Often called the <em>exported</em> and <em>imported</em> functionality.) This interface has an <em>implementation</em> (or multiple implementations, actually), which, from the user of a module are a black box.</p>

<p>Also, a library is a <em>collection</em> of related functionality, whereas a module only provides a <em>single piece</em> of functionality. Which means that, if you have a system with both modules and libraries, a library will typically contain multiple modules. For example, you might have a collections library which contains a <code>List</code> module, a <code>Set</code> module and a <code>Map</code> module.</p>

<p>While you can certainly write modules without a module system, ideally you want your modules to be separately compilable (for languages and execution environments where that notion even makes sense), separately deployable, and you want module composition to be safe (i.e. composing modules should either work or trigger an error before runtime, but never lead to an runtime error or unexpected behavior). For this, you need a module system, like Racket's units, Standard ML's modules and functors or Newspeak's top-level classes.</p>

<p>So, let's recap:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>library</strong>: collection of related functionality</li>
<li><strong>framework</strong>: Inversion of Control</li>
<li><strong>module</strong>: abstract interface with explicit exports and imports, implementation and interface are separate, there may be multiple implementations and the implementation is hidden</li>

<p>Note: Although it sure sounds that way, I am really <em>not</em> trying to sound smug here. I have looked at all the other answers and I found them terribly confusing.

"<p>I need a data structure that is ordered but also gives fast random access and inserts and removes. Linkedlists are ordered and fast in inserts and removes but they give slow random access. Hashtables give fast random access but are not ordered.</p>

<p>I have heard that some tree structures could do this also, but are they as fast as this solution?</p>
","2988","","<p>What you did is pretty much the right choice.</p>

<p>The cool thing about this is that adding ordering to an existing map implementation by using a double-ended doubly-linked list doesn't actually change its asymptotic complexity, because all the relevant list operations (appending and deleting) have a worst-case step complexity of &Theta;(1). (Yes, deletion is &Theta;(1), too. The reason it is usually &Theta;(n) is because you have to <em>find</em> the element to delete first, which is &Theta;(n), but the actual deletion <em>itself</em> is &Theta;(1). In this particular case, you let the map do the finding, which is something like &Theta;(1) amortized worst-case step complexity or &Theta;(log<sub>b</sub>&thinsp;n) worst-case step complexity, depending on the type of map implementation used.)</p>

<p>The <code>Hash</code> class in Ruby 1.9, for example, is an ordered map, and it is implemented at least in YARV and Rubinius as a hash table embedded into a linked list.</p>

<p>Trees generally have a worst-case step complexity of &Theta;(log<sub>b</sub>&thinsp;n) for random access, whereas hash tables may be worse in the worst case (&Theta;(n)), but usually amortize to &Theta;(1), provided you don't screw up the hash function or the resize function.</p>

<p>I would be interested in seeing more about this if anyone has references.</p>
","2988","","<p>This is a well-known result in empirical software engineering that has been replicated and verified over and over again in countless studies. Which is very rare in software engineering, unfortunately: most software engineering ""results"" are basically hearsay, anecdotes, guesses, opinions, wishful thinking or just plain lies. In fact, most software engineering probably doesn't deserve the ""engineering"" brand.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, despite being one of the most solid, most scientifically and statistically sound, most heavily researched, most widely verified, most often replicated results of software engineering, it is also wrong.</p>

<p>The problem is that all of those studies do not control their variables properly. If you want to measure the effect of a variable, you have to be <em>very</em> careful to change <em>only</em> that <em>one</em> variable and that the other variables don't change <em>at all</em>. Not ""change a few variables"", not ""minimize changes to other variables"". ""Only one"" and the others ""not at all"".</p>

<p>Or, in the brilliant Zed Shaw's words: if you want to measure shit, don't measure other shit.</p>

<p>In this particular case, they did <em>not</em> just measure in which phase (requirements, analysis, architecture, design, implementation, testing, maintenance) the bug was found, they <em>also</em> measured how <em>long</em> it stayed in the system. And it turns out that the phase is pretty much irrelevant, all that matters is the time. It's important that bugs be found <em>fast</em>, not in which phase.</p>

<p>This has some interesting ramifications: if it is important to find bugs <em>fast</em>, then why wait so long with the phase that is most likely to find bugs: testing? Why not put the testing at the <em>beginning</em>?</p>

<p>The problem with the ""traditional"" interpretation is that it leads to inefficient decisions. Because you assume you need to find all bugs during the requirements phase, you drag out the requirements phase unnecessarily long: you can't <em>run</em> requirements (or architectures, or designs), so <em>finding</em> a bug in something that you cannot even <em>execute</em> is freaking <em>hard</em>! Basically, while <em>fixing</em> bugs in the requirements phase is cheap, <em>finding</em> them is expensive.</p>

<p>If, however, you realize that it's not about finding the bugs <em>in the earliest possible phase</em>, but rather about finding the bugs <em>at the earliest possible time</em>, then you can make adjustments to your process, so that you move the phase in which <em>finding</em> bugs is cheapest (testing) to the point in time where <em>fixing</em> them is cheapest (the very beginning).</p>

","2988","","<p>In computer science terms, a <code>Task</code> is a <em>future</em> or a <em>promise</em>. (Some people use those two terms synomymously, some use them differently, nobody can agree on a <em>precise</em> definition.) Basically, a <code>Task&lt;T&gt;</code> ""promises"" to return you a <code>T</code>, but not right now honey, I'm kinda busy, why don't you come back later?</p>

<p>A <code>Thread</code> is a way of fulfilling that promise. But not every <code>Task</code> needs a brand-new <code>Thread</code>. (In fact, creating a thread is often undesirable, because doing so is much more expensive than re-using an existing thread from the threadpool. More on that in a moment.) If the value you are waiting for comes from the filesystem or a database or the network, then there is no need for a thread to sit around and wait for the data when it can be servicing other requests. Instead, the <code>Task</code> might register a callback to receive the value(s) when they're ready.</p>

<p>In particular, the <code>Task</code> does <em>not</em> say <em>why</em> it is that it takes such a long time to return the value. It <em>might</em> be that it takes a long time to compute, or it might that it takes a long time to fetch. Only in the former case would you use a <code>Thread</code> to run a <code>Task</code>. (In .NET, threads are freaking expensive, so you generally want to avoid them as much as possible and really only use them if you want to run multiple heavy computations on multiple CPUs. For example, in Windows, a thread weighs 12&thinsp;KiByte (I think), in Linux, a thread weighs as little as 4&thinsp;KiByte, in Erlang/BEAM even just 400&thinsp;Byte. In .NET, it's 1&thinsp;MiByte!)</p>

"<p>So my problem is that I have two classes with the same name.</p>

<p>One is REXML::Document, which is a third party library.</p>

<p>In my controller when I do ""Document.transaction"" he tells me that method ""transaction"" doesn't exist for class ""REXML::Document"" but what I really want is to use my model. My model doesn't belong to a module so how can I tell ruby that he should look to the model ""Document"" instead of ""REXML::Document"" ?</p>
","2988","","<p><code>::Document</code> tells Ruby to start the name lookup at the top-level as opposed to the current level.</p>

<p>It's similar a Unix pathname, where the <code>/</code> also functions both as a pathname component separator and as a flag to not use relative lookup.</p>

<p>However, if you are inside your controller, <code>Document</code> by itself should <em>never</em> refer to <code>REXML::Document</code>. It should <em>always</em> only look for <code>Document</code>, first in the current namespace, then one level up, and so forth until the top-level namespace (which is actually nothing special, it's just the <code>Object</code> class).</p>

<p>Unless, of course, you have <code>include REXML</code> somewhere in your code, in which case, there is an even simpler remedy than using <code>::Document</code>: just don't do that.</p>

"<p>Could you create an object from a class named <code>Trung.NguyenThe</code> since <code>NguyenThe</code> isn't a method ?</p>
","2988","","<p>In Ruby, there's no such thing as a class name. Classes are just objects like every other object which get assigned to variables just like any other variable.</p>

<p><code>Trung.NguyenThe</code> is not a legal variable name, therefore this is impossible:</p>

<pre><code>class Object
  klass = Class.new do
    def to_s; 'Hello' end
  end
  const_set :'Trung.NguyenThe', klass
  # NameError: wrong constant name Trung.NguyenThe
end
</code></pre>

<p>You <em>could</em>, of course, create an object which responds to a <code>NguyenThe</code> message with a class and assign that object to a variable named <code>Trung</code>, but that's not what you are asking about:</p>

<pre><code>klass = Class.new do
  def to_s; 'Hello' end
end
(Trung = Object.new).define_singleton_method(:NguyenThe) { klass }

puts Trung.NguyenThe.new
# Hello

<p>In C# and Java, periods are illegal in class names as well. C# has an escaping mechanism that allows you to use otherwise reserved words as names, but this mechanism doesn't make it possible to use illegal names, only reserved ones.</p>

<p>There are proposals for more symbolic freedom in Java names, but so far, they have not yet been implemented.</p>

"<p>Is there a reasonable way in Python to implement mixin behavior similar to that found in Ruby -- that is, without using inheritance?</p>

<pre><code>class Mixin(object):
    def b(self): print ""b()""
    def c(self): print ""c()""

class Foo(object):
    # Somehow mix in the behavior of the Mixin class,
    # so that all of the methods below will run and
    # the issubclass() test will be False.

    def a(self): print ""a()""

f = Foo()
f.a()
f.b()
f.c()
print issubclass(Foo, Mixin)
</code></pre>

<p>I had a vague idea to do this with a class decorator, but my attempts led to confusion. Most of my searches on the topic have led in the direction of using inheritance (or in more complex scenarios, multiple inheritance) to achieve mixin behavior.</p>
","2988","","<p>I am not that familiar with Python, but from what I know about Python metaprogramming, you could actually do it pretty much the same way it is done in Ruby.</p>

<p>In Ruby, a module basically consists of two things: a pointer to a method dictionary and a pointer to a constant dictionary. A class consists of three things: a pointer to a method dictionary, a pointer to a constant dictionary and a pointer to the superclass.</p>

<p>When you mix in a module <code>M</code> into a class <code>C</code>, the following happens:</p>

<ol>
<li>an anonymous class <code>α</code> is created (this is called an <em>include class</em>)</li>
<li><code>α</code>'s method dictionary and constant dictionary pointers are set equal to <code>M</code>'s</li>
<li><code>α</code>'s superclass pointer is set equal to <code>C</code>'s</li>
<li><code>C</code>'s superclass pointer is set to <code>α</code></li>
</ol>

<p>In other words: a fake class which shares its behavior with the mixin is injected into the inheritance hierarchy. So, Ruby actually <em>does</em> use inheritance for mixin composition.</p>

<p>I left out a couple of subleties above: first off, the module doesn't actually get inserted as <code>C</code>'s superclass, it gets inserted as <code>C</code>'s superclasses' (which is <code>C</code>'s singleton class) superclass. And secondly, if the mixin itself has mixed in other mixins, then <em>those</em> also get wrapped into fake classes which get inserted directly above <code>α</code>, and this process is applied recursively, in case the mixed in mixins in turn have mixins.</p>

<p>Basically, the whole mixin hierarchy gets flattened into a straight line and spliced into the inheritance chain.</p>

<p>AFAIK, Python actually allows you to change a class's superclass(es) after the fact (something which Ruby does <em>not</em> allow you to do), and it also gives you access to a class's <code>dict</code> (again, something that is impossible in Ruby), so you should be able to implement this yourself.</p>

"<p>I am just starting to learn Ruby (to eventually move to RoR), but I was just told that Ruby does not support unicode. Is it true? How do Ruby programmers go about supporting unicode? </p>
","2988","","<p>That's not true. What is true is that Ruby does not support <em>only</em> Unicode, it supports a whole slew of other encodings as well.</p>

<p>This is in contrast to systems such as Java, .NET or Python, which follow the ""One Encoding To Rule Them All"" model. Ruby has what one of the designers of Ruby's m17n system calls a ""CSI"" model (Code Set Indepedent), which means that instead of all strings just having one and the same encoding, every string is tagged with its own encoding.</p>

<p>This has some significant advantages both for ease of use and performance, because it means that if your input and output encodings are the same, you never need to transcode, whereas with the One True Encoding model, you need to transcode twice in the worst case (and that worst case unfortunately happens pretty often, because most of these environments chose an internal encoding that nobody actually uses), from the input encoding into the internal encoding and then to the output encoding. In Ruby, you need to transcode at most once.</p>

<p>The basic problem with the OTE model is that whatever encoding you choose as the One True Encoding, it will be a completely arbitrary choice, since there simply isn't a single encoding that everybody, or even a majority, uses.</p>

<p>In Java, for example, they chose UCS-2 as the One True Encoding. Then, a couple of years later, it turned out that UCS-2 was actually not enough to encode all characters, so they had to make a backwards-incompatible change to Java, to switch to UTF-16 as the One True Encoding. Except by that time, a significant portion of the world had moved on from UTF-16 to UTF-8. If Java had been invented a couple of years earlier, they would probably have chosen ASCII as the One True Encoding. If it had been invented in another country, it might be Shift-JIS. If it had been invented by another company, it might be EBCDIC. It's <em>really</em> completely arbitrary, and such an important choice <em>shouldn't</em> be.</p>

","2988","","<p>You need to read the file back in using the same encoding you used to write it out, obviously.

<p>I've tried searching the web for an explanation, but the &lt;&lt; gets stripped from most useful search engines, so it ends up just searching for class self, which isn't very useful.  Any insight would be appreciated.</p>
","2988","","<p>In Ruby, <code>class &lt;&lt; foo</code> opens up the <em>singleton class</em> of the object referenced by <code>foo</code>. In Ruby, every object has a singleton class associated with it which only has a single instance. This singleton class holds object-specific behavior, i.e. singleton methods.</p>

<p>If all you are using the singleton class for, is defining singleton methods, there is actually a shortcut for that: <code>def foo.bar</code>.</p>

<p>Your first example works, because uninitialized local variables (as well as global variables and instance variables) evaluate to <code>nil</code>. Therefore, <code>puts bar</code> is perfectly fine: in one case <code>bar</code> is initialized to <code>100</code> and this evaluates to <code>100</code>, in the other case it is uninitialized and thus evaluates to <code>nil</code>. <code>puts</code> calls <code>to_s</code> on its argument, which is defined for <code>nil</code> (it simply returns the empty string), so everything is fine and dandy.</p>

","2988","","<p>VirtualBox is a virtualizer, not an emulator. (The name kinda gives it away.) I.e. it can only virtualize a CPU that is actually there, not emulate one that isn't. In particular, VirtualBox can only virtualize x86 and AMD64 CPUs. iOS only runs on ARM CPUs.</p>

"<p>What is the definition of technical debt?</p>
","2988","","<p>The <em>Technical Debt</em> Metaphor is meant to evoke an analogy to Financial Debt.</p>

<p>Financial Debt can be used as a tool to bootstrap a business: you need machines to make money, but you need money to buy machines. You break this catch-22 by taking out a loan to buy machines, and then repaying the loan using the money you gained using the machines.</p>

<p>Technical Debt can be used as a tool to boostrap your understanding of the domain: you need to play around with the software to figure out what it's all about, but you need to know what it's about to write the software. You break this catch-22 by writing the software as best as you can using the partial understanding you have currently, then rewrite the software using the understanding you gained from playing around with it.</p>

<p>Just like Financial Debt, Technical Debt needs to be small, needs to be paid back, and it accumulates interest if it <em>isn't</em> paid back.</p>

<p>It's very important that Technical Debt is a tool for <em>understanding</em>. It is <em>not</em> an excuse for bad code, bad design or bad decicions. It is <em>not</em> about getting a product out of the door.</p>

<p>It is about getting experience. (Note that getting a product out of the door might very well be a prerequisite to getting experience, but it's not what Technical Debt is about.)</p>

<p>Ward Cunningham originally coined the term when he was explaining to his boss why refactoring was important. The software they were working on was financial software, the company was a financial company, the boss was a finance guy, so he used a financial metaphor.</p>

<p>Since you specifically asked about a definition, here's mine:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Technical Debt</em> is the difference between your current understanding of the domain and the understanding that is reflected in the current version of the software.</p>

"<p>In rspec: Can I attach a message to a check the same way as I would do in xUnit style test frameworks? How?</p>

<pre><code>assert_equal value1, value2, ""something is wrong""
</code></pre>
","2988","","<p>In RSpec, it's the matcher's job to print a sensible failure message. The generic matchers that ship with RSpec can obviously only print generic non-descript failure messages, since they don't know anything about your particular domain. That's why it is recommended that you write your own domain-specific matchers, which will give you both more readable tests and more readable failure messages.</p>

<p>Here's an example from the <a href=""https://www.relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/docs/custom-matchers/define-matcher"" rel=""nofollow"">RSpec documentation</a>:</p>

<pre><code>require 'rspec/expectations'

RSpec::Matchers.define :be_a_multiple_of do |expected|
  match do |actual|
    (actual % expected).zero?
  end
  failure_message_for_should do |actual|
    ""expected that #{actual} would be a multiple of #{expected}""
  end
  failure_message_for_should_not do |actual|
    ""expected that #{actual} would not be a multiple of #{expected}""
  end
  description do
    ""be multiple of #{expected}""
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Note: only <code>match</code> is required, the others will be generated automatically. However, the whole point of your question is of course that you do <em>not</em> like the default messages, so you need to at least also define <code>failure_message_for_should</code>.</p>

<p>Also, you can define <code>match_for_should</code> and <code>match_for_should_not</code> instead of <code>match</code> if you need different logic in the positive and negative case.</p>

<p>As @Chris Johnsen shows, you can also explicitly pass a message to the expectation. However, you run the risk of losing the readability advantages.</p>

<p>Compare this:</p>

<pre><code>user.permissions.should be(42), 'user does not have administrative rights'
</code></pre>

<p>with this:</p>

<pre><code>user.should have_administrative_rights
</code></pre>

<p>That would (roughly) be implemented like this:</p>

<pre><code>require 'rspec/expectations'

RSpec::Matchers.define :have_administrative_rights do
  match do |thing|
    thing.permissions == 42
  end
  failure_message_for_should do |actual|

  end
  failure_message_for_should_not do |actual|
    'user has administrative rights'

<p>Yes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Second, is there a way, as a programmer, that I can guarantee in my code that I am working with an unmodified version of a class?</p>

<p>Not yet. Classboxes in Ruby 2.0 are (hopefully) going to be the solution.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Third, should I ever be ""opening"" classes in my code, for any reason?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Only as a last resort.</p>

<p>You should <em>never</em> monkey-patch your own classes. There's simply no point. You control them, you can make them do what you want in the first place.</p>

<p>You should never monkey-patch classes in a library. (The exception to this rule are libraries whose <em>sole purpose</em> it is to monkey-patch something, e.g. Marc-André Lafortune's <code>backports</code> library, which monkey-patches Ruby 1.8.6, 1.8.7, 1.9.0 and 1.9.1 with as much as possible of the functionality from Ruby 1.9.2.) You <em>may</em> provide an add-on library which provides monkey-patches that make it easier to use your library (e.g. you have an encryption library which provides a <code>Kryptonite.encrypt(str)</code> method and you provide an add-on <code>String#encrypt</code> method), but that add-on should be in a separate library, which the user needs to <em>explicitly</em> <code>require</code>. It should be fully optional.</p>

<p>You should not monkey-patch core classes. This refers to classes like <code>Array</code> or <code>Symbol</code> in Ruby, but for a Rails library, I would also include classes like <code>ActiveRecord::Base</code> under the ""core"" label. (Same caveat as above. E.g. in versions of Rails before 3.0, there was no well-defined plugin API, monkey-patching was the <em>only way</em> to extend Rails. Without people who broke this rule, there would never haven been any plugins, and Rails would never be where it is now.)</p>

<p>Try inheritance first. Try composition (wrappers, proxies, facades, adapters, &hellip;) first. Try refactoring first. Try helper objects first. <em>Only</em> if that doesn't work, turn to monkey-patching.</p>

<p>Be respectful when you monkey-patch: if you are adding a new method, make sure it doesn't already exist, and deal with it if it does (e.g. call it from your method). If you are wrapping an existing method, make sure that if somebody else has already wrapped it, their wrapper gets called and that when somebody wants to wrap it afterwards, your wrapper allows that. (In particular, this means you must preserve the method's existing contract.)</p>

<p>Put your monkey-patches in a mixin, if at all possible. That way, they show up in the inheritance chain, which will give anybody who tries to debug the code a fighting chance to figure out what is going on. Put your monkey-patches in separate, obviously named files.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Finally, how is this sort of thing handled in a large-scale, production coding environment? In other words, do people in the programming industry actually do this in code that others will use? Or even if they don't, how do you ensure that some plugin author    somewhere isn't doing something like this that will ruin an essential part of your program?</p>

<p>Don't work with ""really bad programmers"", as you call them.</p>

<p>As simplistic as this sounds, that's basically what it boils down to. Yes, of course, you can write tests, do code reviews, practice pair programming, use static analysis tools, run your code with warnings enabled (e.g. the code you posted in your question will generate a <code>warning: method redefined; discarding old ==</code>). But for me, that's all something that a not-really-bad-programmer would do anyway.</p>

<p>Any one can explain me how can I do the behavior I'm looking for?</p>

","2988","","<p>In Ruby, only blocks can be closures, class bodies (as well as module and method bodies) cannot be closures.

"<p>On ruby, what is the reason for <code>include</code> is private, while <code>Object#extend</code> is public?</p>
","2988","","<p><code>Object#extend</code> <em>has</em> to be public, otherwise you wouldn't be able to use it. After all, its purpose is to mix in a module into an object, so you'd generally call it like <code>obj.extend(Foo)</code>, which isn't possible with private methods.</p>

<p>My guess is the reason why it is private is that it is more invasive, because it changes the behavior of <em>every</em> instance of <code>Bar</code>, whereas <code>Object#extend</code> only changes a single object. Therefore, <code>Module#include</code> is in some sense ""more dangerous"" and thus is made private.</p>

","2988","","<p>Unfortunately, it is quite common for software vendors to put Field Of Use Restrictions in their EULAs which forbid benchmarking their products. Whether or not the specific product you are talking about has such restrictions and whether such restrictions are legally binding in your jurisdiction is something only a lawyer, or ultimately a court of law, can determine.</p>

<p>For example, I live in Germany, where a lot of stuff which US companies put in their EULAs is actually illegal and thus void. You can legally run Apple software on non-Apple hardware, and you can legally re-sell Microsoft OEM licenses, both of which is expressly forbidden in the licenses but is simply an illegal restriction and thus void under German law.</p>

<p>Microsoft's EULAs for instance, at least for their server products, routinely <em>do</em> forbid benchmarking, even though the US DoJ has actually ruled this practice illegal.</p>

<p>Why couldn't anonymous inner class wrapped functions represent functions as defined in lambda calculus? </p>

<p>What actually is an anonymous function and how you can say that some language supports anonymous functions?</p>
","2988","","<p>As I already hinted at with my comment above, the question really hinges on how exactly you define ""support"". In your question you already mentioned that Java is Turing-complete, and thus Java ""supports"" (for some definition of ""supports"") everything that every other programming language supports.</p>

<p>Java <em>does</em> support anonymous functions: just write an interpreter for the &lambda;-calculus in Java and pass the anonymous function in as a string.</p>

<p>However, I for one find that too much work for using an anonymous function. So, for me the interesting question is not so much whether Java supports anonymous functions but whether, when I want to use anonymous functions, Java supports <em>me</em>. IOW: does Java make it easy to use anonymous functions, does it guide me, does it help me?</p>

<p>Let's make a simple experiment: implement the <code>map</code> function and use it to increment every element of the list <code>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</code> by <code>1</code>.</p>

<h2>Haskell</h2>

<p>Here's how the implementation of <code>morph</code> (which is what I'm going to call the function in order to not collide with the already existing builtin <code>map</code> function) looks like in Haskell:</p>

<pre><code>morph _ []     = []
morph f (x:xs) = f x : morph f xs
</code></pre>

<p>That's all. Short and sweet: morphing the empty list with anything is just the empty list, and morphing a list with at least one element is applying the morphing function to the first element and concatenating that with the result of morphing the rest of the list.</p>

<p>As you can see, writing a function which accepts a function as an argument, is very easy, very lightweight.</p>

<p>Assuming that we have a list <code>l</code>:</p>

<pre><code>l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
</code></pre>

<p>We can now call morph like so:</p>

<pre><code>morph (\x -&gt; 1 + x) l
</code></pre>

<p>Again, <em>passing</em> an anonymous function to our higher-order function is very easy, very lightweight.</p>

<p>And it looks almost like &lambda;-calculus. In fact, if you use a Haskell IDE, a text editor with a Haskell mode or a Haskell pretty-printer, it will actually be displayed like this:</p>

<pre><code>morph (λx → 1 + x) l
</code></pre>

<p>It gets even easier if we use an <em>operator section</em>, which allows us to pass a partially applied operator:</p>

<pre><code>morph (1+) l
</code></pre>

<p>Or, we can pass the pre-defined <code>succ</code> function which returns the successor of an integer:</p>

<pre><code>morph succ l
</code></pre>

<p>Although this is of course not an anonymous function, it is a named one.</p>

<h2>Scala</h2>

<p>In Scala, it looks very similar. The main difference is that Scala's type system is more complex than Haskell's and thus requires more type annotations:</p>

<pre><code>def morph[A, B](l: List[A])(f: A =&gt; B): List[B] = l match {
  case Nil     =&gt; Nil
  case x :: xs =&gt; f(x) :: morph(xs)(f)
}
</code></pre>

<p>It is still very lightweight. Essentially, all we had to do was to declare the <code>f</code> parameter to be of type <code>A =&gt; B</code> (i.e. a function from type <code>A</code> to type <code>B</code>), which is actually syntactic sugar for <code>Function1[A, B]</code>.</p>

<p>Now we just need our list:</p>

<pre><code>val l = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
</code></pre>

<p>And morph it:</p>

<pre><code>morph(l) {_ + 1}
</code></pre>

<p>This takes again advantage of some of Scala's syntactic sugar. In anonymous functions, you can leave off the parameter list; if use every parameter exactly once and in the order they are defined, you can simply refer to them as <code>_</code>.</p>

<p>But even the full form is not much heavier:</p>

<pre><code>morph(l) {(e) =&gt; e + 1}
</code></pre>

<p>If I had gone through the trouble of making <code>morph</code> an instance method of some class and defined an implicit conversion from <code>List</code> to that class according to the <em>Pimp My Library</em> pattern, I could have even written something like</p>

<pre><code>l morph {_ + 1}
</code></pre>

<h2>Scheme</h2>

<p>Scheme, of course, should have no problems with anonymous and higher-order functions. Here's <code>morph</code>:</p>

<pre><code>(define (morph f l)
    (if (null? l)
        null
        (cons
            (f (first l))
            (morph f (rest l)))))
</code></pre>

<p>Here's our list:</p>

<pre><code>(define l '(1 2 3 4 5))
</code></pre>

<p>And our anonymous function usage:</p>

<pre><code>(morph (lambda (e) (+ e 1)) '(1 2 3 4 5))
</code></pre>

<h2>Ruby</h2>

<pre><code>module Enumerable
  def morph
    [].tap {|r| each {|e| r &lt;&lt; yield(e) }}
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>This is <em>extremely</em> lightweight. We didn't even have to define a parameter for the function, because in Ruby, every method has an implied function parameter, called a <em>block</em>.</p>

<pre><code>l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
</code></pre>

<p>Calling it is almost as lightweight as Scala</p>

<pre><code>l.morph {|e| e + 1 }
</code></pre>

<p>I can sort-of replicate the operator sections from the Haskell example by grabbing a reference to the <code>+</code> method of <code>1</code>:</p>

<pre><code>l.morph(&amp;1.method(:+))
</code></pre>

<p>Ruby also has a pre-defined <code>succ</code> method for integers which we can pass using the <code>Symbol#to_proc</code> trick:</p>

<pre><code>l.morph(&amp;:succ)
</code></pre>

<p>Some people criticize blocks in Ruby, because every method can only take a single block, and methods taking more than one function are much uglier, but it's actually not <em>that</em> bad. Here's the same code as above, but without using blocks:</p>

<pre><code>module Enumerable
  def morph(f)
    [].tap &amp;-&gt; r { each &amp;-&gt; e { r &lt;&lt; f.(e) }}
  end
end

l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

l.morph -&gt; e { e + 1 }
l.morph(1.method(:+))
</code></pre>

<h2>ECMAScript</h2>

<p>ECMAScript is a direct descendant of Scheme, so it's no surprise that it can handle our problem nicely, although with some amount of syntax clutter:</p>

<pre><code>Array.prototype.morph = function (f) {
    var r = [];
    this.forEach(function (e) { r.push(f(e)); });

    return r;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The main distraction here is the generally ugly syntax, not so much the handling of higher-order functions.</p>

<p>Let's build our list (well, array):</p>

<pre><code>var l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
</code></pre>

<p>And call the <code>morph</code> function (actually, a method in this case) passing an anonymous function as an argument:</p>

<pre><code>l.morph(function (e) { return e + 1; });
</code></pre>

<h2>C#</h2>

<p>Now we're moving closer to our ultimate target language. Here's C#:</p>

<pre><code>public static IEnumerable&lt;B&gt; Morph&lt;A, B&gt;(this IEnumerable&lt;A&gt; l, Func&lt;A, B&gt; f)
{
    IList&lt;B&gt; r = new List&lt;B&gt;();
    foreach (var e in l) r.Add(f(e));

    return r;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Not too bad. Note the type of the function: <code>Func&lt;A, B&gt;</code>. This is a pre-defined type which is part of the core library, just like <code>Function1[A, B]</code> in Scala or <code>a → b</code> in Haskell. (This is an important distinction to Java.)</p>

<p>Thanks to type inference and collection initializers, creating the list isn't all too painful:</p>

<pre><code>var l = new List&lt;int&gt; { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
</code></pre>

<p>And passing a lambda which consists only of a single expression is basically as lightweight as Ruby, Scala, Scheme or Haskell and even more lightweight than ECMAScript, because you don't need the <code>function</code> or <code>return</code> keywords:</p>

<pre><code>l.Morph(e =&gt; e + 1);
</code></pre>

<p>But even using the ""full"" syntax isn't too bad:</p>

<pre><code>l.Morph((e) =&gt; { return e + 1; });
</code></pre>

<p>(You'll notice that I made <code>Morph</code> an extension method, which means I can call it like <code>l.Morph(f)</code> in addition to <code>Morph(l, f)</code>.)</p>

<h2>Java</h2>

<pre><code>static &lt;A, B&gt; List&lt;B&gt; morph(List&lt;A&gt; l, Function1&lt;A, B&gt; f) {
    List&lt;B&gt; r = new ArrayList&lt;B&gt;();
    for (A e: l) r.add(f.apply(e));

    return r;
}
</code></pre>

<p>At first glance, this isn't too bad, actually. In fact, it looks pretty much exactly like the C# version. But why can't I write <code>f(e)</code>? Why do I have to write <code>f.apply(e)</code>? In all other languages I could use the same (or in the case of Ruby, almost the same) syntax for calling a function that was passed as an argument as I would for calling any other function, procedure or method.</p>

<p>I know it isn't much, but it leaves this kind of bitter taste that somehow functions aren't quite first-class. Also, as we'll see further on, there is one of those small annoyances at every single step along the way, and even though every single one of them is insignificant by itself, they <em>do</em> add up.</p>

<p>Here's our list:</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;Integer&gt; l = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
</code></pre>

<p>And this is how we call our <code>morph</code>:</p>

<pre><code>morph(l, new Function1&lt;Integer, Integer&gt;() {
    public Integer apply(Integer n) {
        return n + 1;
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>This is pretty heavy stuff. I mean, all I'm doing is calling a method and passing two arguments. Why does that explode into four lines? In all other languages it was just a simple one-liner. Of course, I could remove all line breaks and it would still be valid:</p>

<pre><code>morph(l, new Function1&lt;Integer, Integer&gt;() { public Integer apply(Integer n) { return n + 1; }});
</code></pre>

<p>But I think you see what I'm getting at. The actual operation that is being performed, incrementing each element by 1, is pretty much invisible between all that noise.</p>

<p>Note also that in some of the other languages I actually used anonymous functions <em>inside</em> the definition of the <code>morph</code> function, for example in Ruby and ECMAScript and it was no big deal. If I were to do that in Java, it would lead to even more clutter and cruft and an explosion of lines.</p>

<p>So, even at this point we are seeing that working with higher-order and anonymous functions in Java is <em>way</em> more cumbersome than in pretty much any other mainstream (and not so mainstream) language.</p>

<p>But we haven't even gotten to the really ugly part yet: what is that <code>Function1&lt;A, B&gt;</code> type there? Where did that come from?</p>

<p>Well, I actually had to <em>write</em> that type <em>myself</em>!</p>

<pre><code>interface Function1&lt;A, B&gt; {
    B apply(A a);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is, of course, a so-called <em>SAM interface</em>, i.e. an interface or an abstract class with a <em>Single 
Abstract Method</em>. Which is the closest thing to a function type Java has. In some sense, a function <em>is</em> just an object with a single method, so that's perfectly fine. The fact that function types are represented via SAM interfaces isn't the problem either. In fact, that's basically how they are are represented in Scala (in Scala, <code>f(a)</code> is just syntactic sugar for <code>f.apply(a)</code>, so <em>any</em> object with an <code>apply</code> method is essentially a function), Ruby (in Ruby, <code>f.(a)</code> is just syntactic sugar for <code>f.call(a)</code>, so <em>every</em> object with a <code>call</code> method is essentially a function) and similarly in C#.</p>

<p>The problem is that I had to write it, that it wasn't already there.</p>

<p>Not only did I have to <em>write</em> it myself, I had to come up with a <em>name</em> for it. <em>And</em> I had to come up with a name for the method. None of which I had to do with any of the other languages here. Well, actually, I just stole the names from Scala, so the actual ""coming up with the names"" part wasn't so difficult.</p>

<p>What's really important are the <em>implications</em> of having to come up with a name. Java has a <em>nominal type system</em>, i.e. a type system based on <em>names</em>. And thus the fact that I had to come up with a name myself means that everybody else also has to come up with names. And because <em>their</em> names are different than mine (and if they aren't, then that will be a compile error), that means that I cannot pass the same function to two different libraries. Say, for example, I want to pass the same filtering function to my gridview and to my ORM. But the gridview expects, say, a <code>javax.swing.Predicate&lt;T&gt;</code> with a single method <code>apply(T el)</code> whereas my ORM expects an <code>org.sleepy.Predicate&lt;T&gt;</code> with a single method <code>apply(T el)</code>.</p>

<p>Note that these two types are really exactly the same, it's just that they have different names and thus I cannot pass the same function to both libraries. This is not a hypothetical example. During the recent discussions about Project Lambda for Java, someone counted how many duplicate instances of a <code>Predicate</code> type there were already in Java SE 6, and IIRC the number was in the double digits.</p>

<p>It is perfectly possible to solve this problem in a nominal type system. After all, there aren't dozens of incompatible copies of a <code>List</code> type, simply because Sun put a <em>single</em> one in the library, and everybody uses that. They could have done the same with <code>Function</code>, but they didn't, which leads to a proliferation of identical, yet mutually incompatible types not only in third-party libraries but even <em>within</em> the JRE. (For example, <code>Runnable</code> is arguably a function type, as is <code>Comparator</code>. But why do they have to be special-cased?) In .NET, it works just fine, because Microsoft put one single type into the runtime. (Well, actually not quite one single type, but close enough.)</p>

<p><em>Because</em> there is no single function type in the JRE, there are also only very few methods which take a function type. This is another thing that makes first-class and anonymous functions hard to use in Java. Once you have one, there's not much you can do with it. You can't filter an array with a predicate function, you can't transform a list using a mapping function, you can't sort a gridview using a comparator function.</p>

<p>This is also one of the reasons why I am so disappointed with some of the iterations of Project Lambda. They keep dropping the introduction of Function Types from the project, although the lack of function types is IMHO one of the biggest problems. The ugly syntax can be fixed with IDE trickery, the lack of standard function types can't. (Not to mention all those people who use the JVM and the JRE but don't use Java. They don't benefit one bit from adding syntactic sugar for anonymous inner SAM classes to the Java language, simply because they <em>do not use</em> the Java language. What they need are function types, and an updated collection library which <em>uses</em> function types.)</p>

<p>So, we're up to four problems now:</p>

<ol>
<li><em>syntactic overhead</em> because you have to use stuff like <code>f.apply(a)</code> and <code>new Function1&lt;A, A&gt;() { public A apply(A a) { return a; }}</code> (BTW, that's the identity function, i.e. the function which does absolutely nothing, and it takes up 58(!) characters),</li>
<li><em>modelling overhead</em> because you have to define your own function types yourself, in addition to the domain types you actually care about,</li>
<li><em>limited usefulness</em> because once you have created your lambdas, there aren't actually that many methods which take lambdas as arguments and </li>
<li><em>limited reuse</em> because even <em>if</em> you find a method that takes a lambda, it doesn't take <em>your</em> lambda, since the types don't match up.</li>
</ol>

<p>And when I talk about ""modelling overhead"", I'm not just talking about <em>one</em> <code>Function1</code> type. Enter primitive types &hellip;</p>

<p>Have you noticed how I used <code>Integer</code>s and not <code>int</code>s in my code above? Yes, that's right, the single biggest design screwup in the history of programming languages, Java's Original Sin, the bane of every Java programmer's existence, has once again come to bite us in the ass: primitive types.</p>

<p>You see, in Scala, there is exactly <em>one</em> class that represents a function with <code>n</code> arguments. It's called <code>FunctionN[T₁, T₂, …, Tn, R]</code>. So, there is exactly one class <code>Function0[R]</code> for functions without any arguments, one class <code>Function1[T, R]</code> for functions with one argument, one class <code>Function3[A, B, C, R]</code> for functions with three arguments and so forth, all the way up to something around 20, I believe.</p>

<p>In C#, there are exactly <em>two</em> classes that represent a function with <code>n</code> arguments: <code>Func&lt;T₁, T₂, …, Tn, R&gt;</code> and <code>Action&lt;T₁, T₂, …, Tn&gt;</code>. This is because there is no type which represents ""no type"". So, you cannot declare a function which doesn't return anything using C# (<code>void</code> is a modifier, not a type), and thus you need a separate type (<code>Action</code>) to represent functions that don't return anything. So, you have two classes <code>Func&lt;R&gt;</code> and <code>Action</code>, which represent functions that don't take any arguments, two classes <code>Func&lt;T, R&gt;</code> and <code>Action&lt;T&gt;</code> which represent functions of one argument and so forth, again up to circa 20. (In Scala, a function that doesn't return anything simply has the return type <code>Unit</code>, so you can just have a <code>Function2[Int, Int, Unit]</code>, for example.)</p>

<p>In Java, however, you need 10&times;9<sup>n</sup> types to represent a function of n arguments. Let me demonstrate that with just <em>one</em> argument:</p>

<p>That's 90(!) different types just to represent the concept of ""something that takes one argument"".</p>

<p>And, of course, if I want to write something which takes a function as an argument, I need to have a corresponding number of overloads as well, so if I want to write a method which filters some values based on a predicate, I need 9 overloads of that function which take <code>Function1_T_boolean</code>, <code>Function1_byte_boolean</code>, <code>Function1_short_boolean</code>, <code>Function1_int_boolean</code>, <code>Function1_long_boolean</code>, <code>Function1_float_boolean</code>, <code>Function1_double_boolean</code>, <code>Function1_boolean_boolean</code> and <code>Function1_char_boolean</code>.</p>

<p>(By the way: this still ignores checked exceptions. Technically, we also need 2<sup>n</sup> copies of every single one of those 90 interfaces, where n is the number of different types of checked exceptions that exist in Java.)</p>

<p>So, that's reasons number 5 and 6: a massive explosion in the number of types and correspondingly the number of methods.</p>

<p>If you put all of that together, then I guess you would agree that anonymous inner classes in Java are much more cumbersome than anonymous functions in, well, pretty much every other programming language.</p>

<p>But there's still more!</p>

<p>We haven't even talked about closures yet! While closures are orthogonal to first-class and anonymous functions, they are also one of the most important (and interesting) use cases of anonymous and first-class functions. Inner classes (whether anonymous or not) <em>are</em> closures, but as @Jon Skeet already pointed out, they are severely limited.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I would say that No, Java does not support anonymous functions.</p>

<p>Oh, I almost forgot: there was another question somewhere:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What actually is an anonymous function</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's easy. A function with no name.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>and how you can say that some language supports anonymous functions?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If it makes it easy to work with them.</p>

<p>Java doesn't: there is a difference between <em>supporting</em> anonymous functions and being able to emulate a subset of the features of anonymous functions by encoding them into anonymous inner SAM classes.</p>

<h3>edit</h3>

<p>To clarify and rephrase.  I'm not trying to launch a debate on ""<strong>WHAT IS THE NEXT BIG THING</strong>""... I'm simply asking ""What is there to take the place of OpenID, should it be <em>dead</em>"".  I'm also NOT saying that I think OpenID <strong>is</strong> dead, but merely asking the question based on a comment made by a well respected developer.</p>

<p>So back to the original question.  What is there for alternatives? Is there a better ""standard"" out there that is ""open"" yet doesn't fall apart if a provider decides to change something? (changing API's or encryption logic for example)... but also one that can span across multiple providers and still recognize a single user?</p>

"<p>this is my algorithm that I have written it with my friends (which are in stackoverflow site)

I want to complete this algorithm that helps me to get duplicate numbers with their repetition. consider that I have <code>[1,1,3,0,5,1,5]</code>
I want this algorithm to return <code>2</code> duplicate numbers which are <code>1 and 5</code> with their repetition which is <code>3 and 2</code> respectively .how can I do this with <code>O(n)</code>?</p>

13      }

</code></pre>
","2988","","<p>In this particular instance it's not so much about the algorithm, it's about the data structure: a <code>Multiset</code> is like a <code>Set</code>, except it doesn't store only unique items, instead it stores a count of how often each item is in the <code>Multiset</code>. Basically, a <code>Set</code> tells you whether a particular item is in the <code>Set</code> <em>at all</em>, a <code>Multiset</code> in addition also tells you <em>how often</em> that particular item is in the <code>Multiset</code>.</p>

<p>So, basically all you have to do is to construct a <code>Multiset</code> from your <code>Array</code>. Here's an example in Ruby:</p>

<pre><code>require 'multiset'

print Multiset[1,1,3,0,5,1,5]
</code></pre>

<p>Yes, that's all there is to it. This prints:</p>

<pre><code>#3 1
#1 3
#1 0
#2 5
</code></pre>

<p>If you only want actual duplicates, you simply <code>delete</code> those items with a count less than <code>2</code>:</p>

<pre><code>print Multiset[1,1,3,0,5,1,5].delete_with {|item, count| count &lt; 2 }
</code></pre>

<p>This prints just</p>

<pre><code>#1 3
#2 5
</code></pre>

<p>As @suihock mentions, you can also use a <code>Map</code>, which basically just means that instead of the <code>Multiset</code> taking care of the element counting for you, you have to do it yourself:</p>

<pre><code>m = [1,1,3,0,5,1,5].reduce(Hash.new(0)) {|map, item| map.tap { map[item] += 1 }}
print m
# { 1 =&gt; 3, 3 =&gt; 1, 0 =&gt; 1, 5 =&gt; 2 }
</code></pre>

<p>Again, if you only want the duplicates:</p>

<pre><code>print m.select {|item, count| count &gt; 1 }
# { 1 =&gt; 3, 5 =&gt; 2 }
</code></pre>

<p>But you can have that easier if instead of counting yourself, you use <code>Enumerable#group_by</code> to group the elements by themselves and then map the groupings to their sizes. Lastly, convert back to a <code>Hash</code>:</p>

<pre><code>print Hash[[1,1,3,0,5,1,5].group_by(&amp;-&gt;x{x}).map {|n, ns| [n, ns.size] }]
# { 1 =&gt; 3, 3 =&gt; 1, 0 =&gt; 1, 5 =&gt; 2 }
</code></pre>

<p>All of these have an amortized worst case step complexity of &Theta;(n).</p>

"<p>I'm looking for a way (in JavaScript) to collect a set of objects into multiple arrays, where each array contains a certain type of object, and the arrays are stored as values in an associative array, with the keys being the types. For example:</p>

<p>Input:</p>

<pre><code>[&lt;apple&gt;, &lt;cat&gt;, &lt;pear&gt;, &lt;mercedes&gt;, &lt;dog&gt;, &lt;ford&gt;, &lt;orange&gt;]
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code>{
  'fruit': [&lt;apple&gt;, &lt;pear&gt;, &lt;orange&gt;],
  'animal': [&lt;cat&gt;, &lt;dog&gt;],
  'car': [&lt;mercedes&gt;, &lt;ford&gt;]
}
</code></pre>

<p>In ruby, you could do the following:</p>

<pre><code>things_by_type = {}
things.each do |thing|
  (things_by_type[thing.type] ||= []) &lt;&lt; thing
end
</code></pre>

<p>which is nice and concise.</p>

<p>What's a good pattern for doing the same thing in JavaScript that's concise and efficient? I could do something like this, but it's not as nice:</p>

<pre><code>var thing, things_by_type = {};
for (var i = 0; i &lt; things.length; i++) {
  thing = things[i];
  if(things_by_type[thing.type]) {
    things_by_type[thing.type].push(thing);
  } else {
    things_by_type[thing.type] = [thing];
  }
}
</code></pre>

end
</code></pre>
  
  <p>which is nice and concise.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually, you can make that even nicer.</p>

<p>First off, <code>Hash.new</code> takes a block argument which will be called every time a non-existing key is referenced. You can use that to create that key. That way you get rid of the conditional logic inside the block.</p>

<pre><code>things_by_type = Hash.new {|h, k| h[k] = [] }
things.each do |thing|
  things_by_type[thing.type] &lt;&lt; thing
end
</code></pre>

<p>Secondly, what you have here is called a <code>fold</code> or <code>reduce</code>: you are ""folding"" or ""reducing"" a collection (the array of objects) into a single value (the hash, which confusingly also happens to be a collection, but is nonetheless a single value).</p>

<p>You can generally easily spot this pattern by looking for places where you initialize some variable, then loop over a collection and manipulate that variable at every iteration of the loop.</p>

<p>Ruby has folding built in, via the <code>Enumerable#reduce</code> method:</p>

<pre><code>things.reduce(Hash.new {|h, k| h[k] = [] }) do |h, thing|
  h.tap { h[thing.type] &lt;&lt; thing }
end
</code></pre>

<p>But what you are <em>really</em> doing, is grouping the array by the type attribute of its elements, which is also built into Ruby as <code>Enumerable#group_by</code>:</p>

<pre><code>things.group_by {|thing| thing.type }
</code></pre>

<p>Which can be further simplified by using <code>Symbol#to_proc</code> to</p>

<pre><code>things.group_by(&amp;:type)
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately, ECMAScript doesn't have <code>groupBy</code>, nor default values for non-existing properties, but it <em>does</em> have <code>Array.prototype.reduce</code>:</p>

<pre><code>things.reduce(function (acc, thing) {
    (acc[thing.type] || (acc[thing.type] = [thing])).push(thing);
    return acc;
}, {});

    return call_block(n-1) + call_block(n-2)

  end

end


puts call_block(10) {puts ""Take this""}
</code></pre>
","2988","","<p>First, let's clean that up a bit so that it's easier to see what's going wrong:</p>

<pre><code>def call_block(n)
  return 0 if n == 1
  return 1 if n == 2

  yield

  call_block(n-1) + call_block(n-2)
end

puts call_block(10) { puts 'Take this' }
</code></pre>

<p>Now let's just trace it through.</p>

<p>We start by calling</p>

<pre><code>call_block(10) { puts 'Take this' }
</code></pre>

<p>So, <code>n</code> is <code>10</code> and the block is { puts 'Take this' }. Since <code>n</code> is neither <code>1</code> nor <code>2</code>, we arrive at the <code>yield</code>, which transfers control to the block.</p>

<p>Now we are calling</p>

<pre><code>call_block(n-1)
</code></pre>

<p>which is</p>

<pre><code>call_block(9)
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that we are not calling it with a block. So, for this new call, <code>n</code> is <code>9</code> and there is no block. Again, we skip the first two lines and come to the <code>yield</code>.</p>

<p>But there is no block to <code>yield</code> to, and that's why the code blows up here.</p>

<p>The solution is both obvious and subtle. The obvious part is: the problem is that we are not passing a block, thus the solution is we need to pass the block along. The subtle part is: how do we do that?</p>

<p>The thing that makes Ruby blocks so syntactically lightweight, is that they are anonymous. But if the block doesn't have a name, we cannot refer to it, and if we cannot refer to it, then we cannot pass it along.</p>

<p>The solution to this is to use another construct in Ruby, which is basically a more heavyweight abstraction for the idea of ""a chunk of code"" than a block: a <code>Proc</code>.</p>

<pre><code>def call_block(n, blk)
  return 0 if n == 1
  return 1 if n == 2

  blk.()

  call_block(n-1, blk) + call_block(n-2, blk)
end

puts call_block(10, -&gt;{ puts 'Take this' })
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, this <em>is</em> a little bit heavier syntactically, but we can give the <code>Proc</code> a name, and thus pass it along to the recursive calls.</p>

<p>However, this pattern is actually common enough that there is special support in Ruby for it. If you put a <code>&amp;</code> sigil in front of a parameter name in a parameter list, Ruby will ""package up"" a block that is passed as an argument into a <code>Proc</code> object and bind it to that name. And conversely, if you put a <code>&amp;</code> sigil in front of an argument expression in an argument list, it will ""unpack"" that <code>Proc</code> into a block:</p>

<pre><code>def call_block(n, &amp;blk)
  return 0 if n == 1
  return 1 if n == 2

  yield # or `blk.()`, whichever you prefer

  call_block(n-1, &amp;blk) + call_block(n-2, &amp;blk)
end

puts call_block(10) { puts 'Take this' }

","2988","","<p>You are missing the Hpricot library, which is an HTML parser.</p>

<p>However, I am not sure <em>why</em> it is missing. It is properly listed as a dependency in Premailer's package specification and it should have been automatically installed when you installed Premailer (unless you explicitly disabled it with the <code>--ignore-dependencies</code> flag).</p>

<p>Also, the Premailer binary should have been installed in <code>C:\Ruby192\bin</code>, not <code>C:\Workspace\Premailer\bin</code>.</p>

<p>Try uninstalling Premailer:</p>

<p>And then try again to install it:</p>

<p>Note: Hpricot is actually written in C, not in Ruby, so to install it, you need to have the RubyInstaller DevKit installed. (This could be an explanation why it didn't get installed automatically.)</p>

<p>A general tip: if you want to interoperate between the CLI and Ruby, it is much easier to use the IronRuby Ruby implementation instead of YARV, which it appears you are using, because IronRuby actually runs on the CLI (more precisely the DLR) and has a standardized API for calling CLI code from Ruby and vice versa (and that API is fully compatible with C# 4's <code>dynamic</code>). Except in <em>this</em> particular case that won't work because, as I mentioned, Hpricot is written in C, as an extension to YARV, so it simply won't work with IronRuby.</p>

<p>Without the actual code that is generating the actual error, it is impossible to answer your question. However, here are a few general tips:</p>

<p>Whenever the computer tells you that it cannot find something, in 99% of the cases, the problem is that the thing the computer tells it couldn't find isn't actually there.</p>

<p>So, in this case, the computer tells you that it cannot find a file named <code>makRequire.rb</code>, and the most likely explanation for that is that <code>makRequire.rb</code> doesn't actually exist.

Because if it doesn't exist, then the reason why the computer cannot find it, should be rather obvious.</p>

<p>In 99% of the <em>rest</em> of the cases, the problem is that the thing the computer is looking for <em>does</em> exist, but the computer is looking in the wrong place. So, after you have verified that <code>makRequire.rb</code> actually <em>does</em> exist, you need to make sure that the directory the file is in, is in Ruby's <code>$LOAD_PATH</code>, and if it isn't, you need to add that directory to Ruby's <code>$LOAD_PATH</code>. Alternatively, if you want to <code>require</code> the file relative to the path of the file that is doing the requiring, you need to use <code>require_relative</code> instead of <code>require</code>.</p>

<p>The third thing to check for, is whether the user who own the <code>ruby</code> process has sufficient privileges to access the file <code>makRequire.rb</code>, the directory it is in and all of its parent directories.</p>

"<p>I have read amortized analysis in coreman but unable to understand what it realy is.
i went through internet but unable to understand.please someone make me understand.thanks</p>
","2988","","<p>The idea behind amortized analysis is based on the idea of amortization in economics: you spend more money now, in order to save money over time. For example: you spend an extra $500 to buy the car with a more modern, more fuel-efficient engine, and over time, you amortize those $500 by saving gas.</p>

<p>The way that amortized analysis differs from most other kinds, is that it looks at a whole sequence of operations, not a single operation.</p>

<p>For example, worst-case analysis would look at insertion into a dynamic array and say ""if the array is full, you need to copy the entire array into a bigger array, therefore the worst-case step complexity of inserting into a dynamic array is <code>Ο(n)</code>"".</p>

<p>Amortized worst-case analysis would say that resizing only happens very seldomly, <em>and</em> it actually buys you the possibility of doing insertions in <code>Ο(1)</code> for the foreseeable future. So, while the worst-case for one individual insertion is <code>Ο(n)</code>, this worst-case will only appear <code>Ο(1)</code> times every <code>Ω(n)</code> operations, which means the cost of resizing the array is amortized over the lifetime of the array, so the overall amortized worst-case step complexity of inserting into a dynamic array is <code>Ο(1)</code>.</p>

"<p>I can understand why there is <em>public</em> and <em>private</em> access modifier, these two are also found in almost any language. I can even understand why there might be a <em>package</em> modifier, as you may want to have your classes (those that tightly belong together) interact with each other in a way, that is not suitable for public interaction (e.g. as it depends upon knowledge of class internals, maybe because it would reveal a secret, or maybe because it may change at any time and relying on it will break all existing code, and so on). However, why would I want to have a <em>protected</em> identifier?

Thank you for all the answers. Putting them all together I was able (finally) to grok the obvious (and not so obvious for someone, who have never seen things like Ruby): that <code>self</code> itself can be
explicit and implicit receiver and that make the difference. So there are two rules, if you want to call a private method: <code>self</code> must be implicit receiver, and that self must be an instance of current class (<code>Example</code> in that case - and that takes place only when self if inside instance method definition, during this method execution). Please correct me if I am wrong.</p>

<pre><code>class Example 

 # self as an explicit receiver (will throw an error)
 def explicit 
  self.some_private_method

","2988","","<p>The <em>definition</em> of <code>private</code> in Ruby is ""can only be called without an explicit receiver"". And that's why you can only call private methods without an explicit receiver. There is no other explanation.</p>

<p>Note that there actually is an exception to the rule: because of the ambiguity between local variables and method calls, the following will <em>always</em> be resolved to be an assignment to a local variable:</p>

<pre><code>foo = :bar
</code></pre>

<p>So, what do you do if you want to call a writer called <code>foo=</code>? Well, you <em>have</em> to add an explicit receiver, because without the receiver Ruby simply won't know that you want to call the method <code>foo=</code> instead of assigning to the local variable <code>foo</code>:</p>

<pre><code>self.foo = :bar
</code></pre>

<p>But what do you do if you want to call a <code>private</code> writer called <code>foo=</code>? You <em>can't</em> write <code>self.foo =</code> because <code>foo=</code> is <code>private</code> and thus cannot be called with an explicit receiver. Well, actually for <em>this</em> specific case (and this case <em>alone</em>), you <em>can</em> actually use an explicit receiver of <code>self</code> to call a <code>private</code> writer.</p>
"
"<p>In python, it's fairly straightforward to reference a function:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def foo():
...     print ""foo called""
...     return 1
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = foo
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo()
foo called
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; x()
foo called
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; x
&lt;function foo at 0x1004ba5f0&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo
&lt;function foo at 0x1004ba5f0&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>However, it seems to be different in Ruby since a naked <code>foo</code> actually calls foo:</p>

<pre><code>ruby-1.9.2-p0 &gt; def foo
ruby-1.9.2-p0 ?&gt;  print ""foo called""
ruby-1.9.2-p0 ?&gt;  1
ruby-1.9.2-p0 ?&gt;  end
 =&gt; nil 
ruby-1.9.2-p0 &gt; x = foo
foo called =&gt; 1 
ruby-1.9.2-p0 &gt; foo
foo called =&gt; 1 
ruby-1.9.2-p0 &gt; x
 =&gt; 1 
</code></pre>

<p>How do I actually assign the <em>function</em> foo to x and then call it?  Or is there a more idiomatic way to do this?</p>
","2988","","<p>Ruby doesn't have functions. It only has methods (which aren't first-class) and <code>Proc</code>s which are first-class, but are not associated with any object.</p>

<p>So, this is a method:</p>

<pre><code>def foo(bar) puts bar end

foo('Hello')
# Hello
</code></pre>

<p>Oh, and, yes, this <em>is</em> a <em>real</em> method, not a top-level function or procedure or something. Methods defined at the top-level end up as private(!) instance methods in the <code>Object</code> class:</p>

<pre><code>Object.private_instance_methods(false) # =&gt; [:foo]
</code></pre>

<p>This is a <code>Proc</code>:</p>

<pre><code>foo = -&gt; bar { puts bar }

foo.('Hello')
# Hello
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that <code>Proc</code>s are called differently from methods:</p>

<pre><code>foo('Hello')  # method
foo.('Hello') # Proc
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>foo.(bar)</code> syntax is just syntactic sugar for <code>foo.call(bar)</code> (which for <code>Proc</code>s and <code>Method</code>s is also aliased to <code>foo[bar]</code>). Implementing a <code>call</code> method on your object and then calling it with <code>.()</code> is the closest thing you will get to Python's <code>__call__</code>ables.</p>

<p>Note that an important distinction between Ruby <code>Proc</code>s and Python lambdas is that there are no restrictions: in Python, a lambda can only contain a single statement, but Ruby doesn't <em>have</em> the distinction between statements and expressions (<em>everything</em> is an expression), and so this limitation simply doesn't exist, therefore in a lot of cases where you <em>need</em> to pass a named function as an argument in Python because you cannot express the logic in a single statement, you would in Ruby simply pass a <code>Proc</code> or a block instead, so that the problem of the ugly syntax for referencing methods doesn't even arise.</p>

<p>You can <em>wrap</em> a method in a <code>Method</code> object (which essentially duck-types <code>Proc</code>) by calling the <code>Object#method</code> method on an object (which will give you a <code>Method</code> whose <code>self</code> is bound to that particular object):</p>

<pre><code>foo_bound = self.method(:foo)

foo_bound.('Hello')
# Hello
</code></pre>

<p>You can also use one of the methods in the <code>Module#instance_method</code> family to get an <code>UnboundMethod</code> from a module (or class, obviously, since a class is-a module), which you can then <code>UnboundMethod#bind</code> to a particular object and call. (I think Python has the same concepts, albeit with a different implementation: an unbound method simply takes the self argument explicitly, just like the way it is declared.)</p>

<pre><code>foo_unbound = Object.instance_method(:foo) # this is an UnboundMethod

foo_unbound.('Hello')
# NoMethodError: undefined method `call' for #&lt;UnboundMethod: Object#foo&gt;

foo_rebound = foo_unbound.bind(self)       # this is a Method

foo_rebound.('Hello')
# Hello
</code></pre>

<p>Note that you can only bind an <code>UnboundMethod</code> to an object which is an instance of the module you took the method from. You cannot use <code>UnboundMethods</code> to ""transplant"" behavior between unrelated modules:</p>

<pre><code>bar = module Foo; def bar; puts 'Bye' end; self end.instance_method(:bar)
module Foo; def bar; puts 'Hello' end end

obj = Object.new
bar.bind(obj)
# TypeError: bind argument must be an instance of Foo

obj.extend(Foo)
bar.bind(obj).()
# Bye
obj.bar
# Hello
</code></pre>

<p>Note, however, that both the <code>Method</code> and the <code>UnboundMethod</code> are <em>wrappers</em> around the method, <em>not</em> the method itself. Methods are <em>not</em> objects in Ruby. (Contrary to what I have written in other answers, BTW. I really need to go back and fix those.) You can <em>wrap</em> them in objects, but they <em>aren't</em> objects, and you can see that because you essentially get all the same problems you <em>always</em> get with wrappers: identity and state. If you call <code>method</code> multiple times for the same method, you will get a different <code>Method</code> object every time. If you try to store some state on that <code>Method</code> object (such as Python-style <code>__doc__</code>strings, for example), that state will be private to <em>that particular</em> instance, and if you try to retrieve your docstring again via <code>method</code>, you will find that it is gone.</p>

<p>There have been several proposals in the past to use Ruby's scope resolution operator <code>::</code> to access bound <code>Method</code>s of objects like this:</p>

<pre><code>bound_method = obj::foo
</code></pre>

<p>Which is supposed to be identical to</p>

<pre><code>bound_method = obj.method(:foo)
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that currently, using the scope resolution operator for <em>calling</em> methods is actually supported:</p>

<pre><code>obj.bar
obj::bar
# Hello
</code></pre>

<p>And even worse, this is actually <em>used</em>, so it would be a backwards-incompatible change.</p>

<p>I'm wondering whether there is a method for IEnumerable like the following .Each() in the .Net library</p>

<pre><code>var intArray = new [] {1, 2, 3, 4};
intArrary.Each(Console.WriteLine);
</code></pre>

<p>I know I can use a <code>foreach</code> loop or easily write an extension method like this:</p>

<pre><code>public static class EnumerableExtensions
{
    public static void Each&lt;T&gt;(this IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; enumberable, Action&lt;T&gt; action)
    {
        foreach (var item in enumberable)
        {
            action(item);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>But I'm hoping not to create my own method to mess up code if there is already such an extension method in the library. And something like .Each() (with a few overloadings which can take conditions as extra params) is heavily needed by programmers, and there should already be one. Am I correct?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>Ruby developers may recognize it as a .each() iterator. And that's what I hope to have in C#. Maybe C# can have more iterator methods like those in Ruby.</p>
","2988","","<p>No, there isn't, unfortunately. (I think this question has been discussed before, but I can't find it currently.)</p>

<p>Due to some bizarre accident of history, the <code>ForEach</code> method ended up on <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code>, instead of <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code>, where it would make more sense, and because of backwards-compatiblity, this can never ever be fixed.</p>

<p>Ever since extension methods existed, adding a <code>ForEach(this IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;, ...)</code> extension method was requested over and over again, but it is usually rejected because it would lead to confusing behavior: since instance methods are always selected before extension methods, this would mean that <em>all</em> <code>IEnumerable</code>s get treated identically, <em>except for</em> <code>List</code>s and they wouldn't allow such inconsistencies in the BCL.</p>

<p>As a result, pretty much every .NET project on the planet now starts off with exactly the code you described above:</p>

{
    public static class IEnumerableExtensions
    {
        public static void ForEach&lt;T&gt;(this IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; xs, Action&lt;T&gt; f)

"<p>I am wondering what are some specific questions I should keep in mind when I am comparing programming languages for use on given work projects. For instance, I am told logic programming languages like Prolog are good for natural language processing. I'm not sure why exactly; I assume it is true because experts say so, but I don't know the consideration that guides them to that conclusion. So I am looking for a simple heuristic, a checklist of questions, I can apply to evaluate programming languages and be able to explain my decisions, so that I can say ""Language X is good for Y because it does Z.""</p>
","2988","","<p>The only way I know of to figure out which programming language is most appropriate for a given problem, is to know lots of programming languages. After all, if you don't know screwdrivers exist, how will you know not to use a hammer when you encounter a screw?</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there are thousands (maybe tens of thousands) of programming languages, so learning even a significant portion of them is just not realistic.</p>

<p>However, programming languages implement <em>paradigms</em>. And Peter van Roy's famous poster only lists about 34 of those. Although he deliberately decided to ignore several aspects, including anything related to typing, so the real number is probably higher than that. But we can expect it to be well below 100.</p>

<p>That's still a lot, though, but thankfully, paradigms aren't atomic either, they are composed of <em>concepts</em>. The poster lists about a dozen of those (again ignoring typing and a couple of other things). Significantly less than paradigms.</p>

<p>Learning a significant portion of concepts is entirely feasible. Once you know them, you can look at a problem and see which concepts would be useful to have to build a solution. Then you look at which paradigms contain those concepts and which languages implement those paradigms. Pick one, learn it, use it, solve the problem.</p>

<p>And since you already know the concepts (and thus the paradigms) the language implements, you only need to learn the syntax, not the semantics. There aren't actually that many different syntaxes in the wild (C, C++, Objective-C, Objective-C++, D, Go, Java, C#, ECMAScript, PHP, Vala and many others share a lot of syntax, for example, as do Smalltalk, Self, Newspeak and Objective-C, SML, OCaml and F#, and so on), so chances are, you'll pick that up very quickly.

<p>You simply group the numbers by themselves using <code>Enumerable#group_by</code>, which gives you something like</p>

<pre><code>{ 101 =&gt; [101, 101], 420 =&gt; [420] }
</code></pre>

<p>And then you <code>Enumerable#map</code> the value arrays to their lengths, i.e. <code>[101, 101]</code> becomes <code>2</code>. Then just convert it back to a <code>Hash</code> using <code>Hash::[]</code>.</p>

<p>However, if you are willing to use a third-party library, it becomes even more trivial, because if you use a <code>MultiSet</code> data structure, the answer falls out naturally. (A <code>MultiSet</code> is like a <code>Set</code>, except that an item can be added multiple times and the <code>MultiSet</code> will keep count of how often an item was added&nbsp;&ndash; which is exactly what you want.)</p>

"<p>I'd like to execute an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWK#Versions_and_implementations"" rel=""nofollow"">gawk</a> script with <code>--re-interval</code> using a shebang. The ""naive"" approach of </p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/gawk --re-interval -f
... awk script goes here
</code></pre>

<p>does not work, since gawk is called with the first argument <code>""--re-interval -f""</code> (not splitted around the whitespace), which it does not understand. Is there a workaround for that?</p>

<p>Of course you can either not call gawk directly but wrap it into a shell script that splits the first argument, or make a shell script that then calls gawk and put the script into another file, but I was wondering if there was some way to do this within one file.</p>

<p>The behaviour of shebang lines differs from system to system - at least in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygwin"" rel=""nofollow"">Cygwin</a> it does not split the arguments by whitespaces. I just care about how to do it on a system that behaves like that; the script is not meant to be portable.</p>
","2988","","<p>The shebang line has never been specified as part of POSIX, SUS, LSB or any other specification. AFAIK, it hasn't even been properly documented.</p>

<p>There is a rough consensus about what it does: take everything between the <code>!</code> and the <code>\n</code> and <code>exec</code> it. The assumption is that everything between the <code>!</code> and the <code>\n</code> is a full absolute path to the interpreter. There is no consensus about what happens if it contains whitespace.</p>

<ol>
<li>Some operating systems simply treat the entire thing as the path. After all, in most operating systems, whitespace or dashes are legal in a path.</li>
<li>Some operating systems split at whitespace and treat the first part as the path to the interpreter and the rest as individual arguments.</li>
<li>Some operating systems split at the <em>first</em> whitespace and treat the front part as the path to the interpeter and the rest as a <em>single</em> argument (which is what you are seeing).</li>
<li>Some even don't support shebang lines <em>at all</em>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Thankfully, 1. and 4. seem to have died out, but 3. is pretty widespread, so you simply cannot rely on being able to pass more than one argument.</p>

<p>And since the location of commands is also not specified in POSIX or SUS, you generally use up that single argument by passing the executable's <em>name</em> to <code>env</code> so that <em>it</em> can determine the executable's location; e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env gawk
</code></pre>

<p>[Obviously, this <em>still</em> assumes a particular path for <code>env</code>, but there are only very few systems where it lives in <code>/bin</code>, so this is generally safe. The location of <code>env</code> is a lot more standardized than the location of <code>gawk</code> or even worse something like <code>python</code> or <code>ruby</code> or <code>spidermonkey</code>.]</p>

<p>Which means that you cannot actually use <em>any</em> arguments <em>at all</em>.</p>

","2988","","<p>As the error message already tells you, the problem is that you have a <code>TypeError</code>. Just because Ruby is dynamically and implicitly typed doesn't mean that you don't have to think about types.</p>

<p>The type of <code>Enumerable#inject</code> without an explicit accumulator (this is usually called <code>reduce</code>) is something like</p>

<pre><code>reduce :: [a] → (a → a → a) → a
</code></pre>

<p>or in a more Rubyish notation I just made up</p>

<pre><code>Enumerable[A]#inject {|A, A| A } → A
</code></pre>

<p>You will notice that all the types are the same. The element type of the <code>Enumerable</code>, the two argument types of the block, the return type of the block and the return type of the overall method.</p>

<p>In your case, the types for the block just don't add up. The block gets passed two <code>String</code>s and it is supposed to return a <code>String</code>. But you call the <code>+</code> method on the first argument (which is a <code>String</code>) with an argument that is an <code>Integer</code>. But <code>String#+</code> doesn't take an <code>Integer</code> it only takes a <code>String</code> or more precisely something which can be <em>converted</em> to a <code>String</code>, i.e. something that responds to <code>#to_str</code>. That's why you get a <code>TypeError</code> for <code>String#+</code>.</p>

<p>The type of <code>Enumerable#inject</code> <em>with</em> an explicit accumulator (this is usually called <code>fold</code>) is something like</p>

<pre><code>fold :: [b] → a → (a → b → a) → a

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>Enumerable[B]#inject(A) {|A, B| A } → A
</code></pre>

<p>Here you see that the accumulator can have a <em>different</em> type than the element type of the collection. Which is precisely what you need.</p>

<p>These two rules generally get you through all <code>Enumerable#inject</code>-related problems:</p>

<ol>
<li>the type of the accumulator and the return type of the block must be the same</li>
<li>when not passing an explicit accumulator, the type of the accumulator is the same as the element type</li>
</ol>

<p>Rule #1 will most often bite you when you do something like</p>

<pre><code>acc[key] = value
</code></pre>

<p>in your block, because assignments evaluate to the assigned value, not the receiver of the assignment. You'll have to replace this with</p>

<pre><code>acc.tap { acc[key] = value }
</code></pre>

<p>In your particular case, the two solutions have already been mentioned. Either use an explicit accumulator</p>

"<p>Are these two essentially the same thing? They look very similar to me. </p>

<p>Did lambda expression borrow its idea from Ruby?</p>
","2988","","<h1>C# vs. Ruby</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are these two essentially the same thing? They look very similar to me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They are very different.</p>

<p>First off, lambdas in C# do two <em>very</em> different things, only one of which has an equivalent in Ruby. (And that equivalent is, surprise, lambdas, not blocks.)</p>

<p>In C#, lambda expression literals are overloaded. (Interestingly, they are the <em>only</em> overloaded literals, as far as I know.) And they are overloaded on their <em>result type</em>. (Again, they are the <em>only</em> thing in C# that can be overloaded on its result type, methods can only be overloaded on their argument types.)</p>

<p>C# lambda expression literals can <em>either</em> be an anonymous piece of executable code <em>or</em> an <em>abstract representation</em> of an anonymous piece of executable code, depending on whether their result type is <code>Func</code> / <code>Action</code> or <code>Expression</code>.</p>

<p>Ruby doesn't have any equivalent for the latter functionality (well, there are interpreter-specific non-portable non-standardized extensions). And the equivalent for the former functionality is a lambda, not a block.</p>

<p>The Ruby syntax for a lambda is very similar to C#:</p>

<pre><code>-&gt;(x, y) { x + y }           # Ruby
(x, y) =&gt; { return x + y; } // C#
</code></pre>

<p>In C#, you can drop the <code>return</code>, the semicolon and the curly braces if you only have a single expression as the body:</p>

<pre><code>-&gt;(x, y) { x + y }  # Ruby
(x, y) =&gt; x + y    // C#
</code></pre>

<p>You can leave off the parentheses if you have only one parameter:</p>

<pre><code>-&gt; x { x }  # Ruby
x =&gt; x     // C#
</code></pre>

<p>In Ruby, you can leave off the parameter list if it is empty:</p>

<pre><code>-&gt; { 42 }  # Ruby
() =&gt; 42  // C#
</code></pre>

<p>An alternative to using the literal lambda syntax in Ruby is to pass a block argument to the <code>Kernel#lambda</code> method:</p>

<pre><code>-&gt;(x, y) { x + y }
lambda {|x, y| x + y } # same thing
</code></pre>

<p>The main difference between those two is that you don't know what <code>lambda</code> does, since it could be overridden, overwritten, wrapped or otherwise modified, whereas the behavior of literals cannot be modified in Ruby.</p>

<p>In Ruby 1.8, you can also use <code>Kernel#proc</code> although you should probably avoid that since that method does something different in 1.9.</p>

<p>Another difference between Ruby and C# is the syntax for <em>calling</em> a lambda:</p>

<pre><code>l.()  # Ruby
l()  // C#
</code></pre>

<p>I.e. in C#, you use the same syntax for calling a lambda that you would use for calling anything else, whereas in Ruby, the syntax for calling a method is different from the syntax for calling any other kind of callable object.</p>

<p>Another difference is that in C#, <code>()</code> is built into the language and is only available for certain builtin types like methods, delegates, <code>Action</code>s and <code>Func</code>s, whereas in Ruby, <code>.()</code> is simply syntactic sugar for <code>.call()</code> and can thus be made to work with <em>any</em> object by just implementing a <code>call</code> method.</p>

<h1>procs vs. lambdas</h1>

<p>So, what <em>are</em> lambdas exactly? Well, they are instances of the <code>Proc</code> class. Except there's a slight complication: there are actually two different kinds of instances of the <code>Proc</code> class which are subtly different. (IMHO, the <code>Proc</code> class should be split into two classes for the two different kinds of objects.)</p>

<p>In particular, not all <code>Proc</code>s are lambdas. You can check whether a <code>Proc</code> is a lambda by calling the <code>Proc#lambda?</code> method. (The usual convention is to call lambda <code>Proc</code>s ""lambdas"" and non-lambda <code>Proc</code>s just ""procs"".)</p>

<p>Non-lambda procs are created by passing a block to <code>Proc.new</code> or to <code>Kernel#proc</code>. However, note that before Ruby 1.9, <code>Kernel#proc</code> creates a <em>lambda</em>, not a proc.</p>

<p>What's the difference? Basically, lambdas behave more like methods, procs behave more like blocks.</p>

<p>If you have followed some of the discussions on the Project Lambda for Java 8 mailinglists, you might have encountered the problem that it is not at all clear how non-local control-flow should behave with lambdas. In particular, there are three possible sensible behaviors for <code>return</code> (well, three <em>possible</em> but only two are really <em>sensible</em>) in a lambda:</p>

<ul>
<li>return from the lambda</li>
<li>return from the method the lambda was called from</li>
<li>return from the method the lambda was created in</li>
</ul>

<p>That last one is a bit iffy, since in general the method will have <em>already</em> returned, but the other two both make perfect sense, and neither is more right or more obvious than the other. The current state of Project Lambda for Java 8 is that they use two different keywords (<code>return</code> and <code>yield</code>). Ruby uses the two different kinds of <code>Proc</code>s:</p>

<ul>
<li>procs return from the calling method (just like blocks)</li>
<li>lambdas return from the lambda (just like methods)</li>
</ul>

<p>They also differ in how they handle argument binding. Again, lambdas behave more like methods and procs behave more like blocks: </p>

<ul>
<li>you can pass more arguments to a proc than there are parameters, in which case the excess arguments will be ignored</li>
<li>you can pass less arguments to a proc than there are parameters, in which case the excess parameters will be bound to <code>nil</code></li>
<li>if you pass a <em>single</em> argument which is an <code>Array</code> (or responds to <code>to_ary</code>) and the proc has multiple parameters, the array will be unpacked and the elements bound to the parameters (exactly like they would in the case of destructuring assignment)</li>
</ul>

<h1>Blocks: lightweight procs</h1>

<p>A block is essentially a lightweight proc. <em>Every</em> method in Ruby has <em>exactly one</em> block parameter, which does not actually appear in its parameter list (more on that later), i.e. is implicit. This means that on <em>every</em> method <em>call</em> you can pass a block argument, whether the method expects it or not.</p>

<p>Since the block doesn't appear in the parameter list, there is no name you can use to refer to it. So, how do you use it? Well, the only two things you can do (not really, but more on that later) is <em>call</em> it implicitly via the <code>yield</code> keyword and check whether a block was passed via <code>block_given?</code>. (Since there is no name, you cannot use the <code>call</code> or <code>nil?</code> methods. What would you call them on?)</p>

<p>Most Ruby implementations implement blocks in a very lightweight manner. In particular, they don't actually implement them as objects. However, since they have no name, you cannot refer to them, so it's actually impossible to tell whether they <em>are</em> objects or not. You can just think of them as procs, which makes it easier since there is one less different concept to keep in mind. Just treat the fact that they aren't actually implemented as blocks as a compiler optimization.</p>

<h1><code>to_proc</code> and <code>&amp;</code></h1>

<p>There <em>is</em> actually a way to refer to a block: the <code>&amp;</code> sigil / modifier / unary prefix operator. It can only appear in parameter lists and argument lists.</p>

<p>In a <em>parameter list</em>, it means ""<em>wrap up</em> the implicit block into a proc and bind it to this name"". In an <em>argument list</em>, it means ""<em>unwrap</em> this <code>Proc</code> into a block"".</p>

<pre><code>def foo(&amp;bar)
end
</code></pre>

<p>Inside the method, <code>bar</code> is now bound to a proc object that represents the block. This means for example that you can store it in an instance variable for later use.</p>

<pre><code>baz(&amp;quux)
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, <code>baz</code> is actually a method which takes zero arguments. But of course it takes the implicit block argument which all Ruby methods take. We are passing the contents of the variable <code>quux</code>, but unroll it into a block first.</p>

<p>This ""unrolling"" actually works not just for <code>Proc</code>s. <code>&amp;</code> calls <code>to_proc</code> on the object first, to convert it to a proc. That way, <em>any</em> object can be converted into a block.</p>

<p>The most widely used example is <code>Symbol#to_proc</code>, which first appeared sometime during the late 90s, I believe. It became popular when it was added to ActiveSupport from where it spread to Facets and other extension libraries. Finally, it was added to the Ruby 1.9 core library and backported to 1.8.7. It's pretty simple:</p>

<pre><code>class Symbol
  def to_proc
    -&gt;(recv, *args) { recv.send self, *args }
  end
end

%w[Hello StackOverflow].map(&amp;:length) # =&gt; [5, 13]
</code></pre>

<p>Or, if you interpret classes as functions for creating objects, you can do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>class Class
  def to_proc
    -&gt; *args { new *args }
  end
end

[1, 2, 3].map(&amp;Array) # =&gt; [[nil], [nil, nil], [nil, nil, nil]]
</code></pre>

<h1><code>Method</code>s and <code>UnboundMethod</code>s</h1>

<p>Another class to represent a piece of executable code, is the <code>Method</code> class. <code>Method</code> objects are reified proxies for methods. You can create a <code>Method</code> object, by calling <code>Object#method</code> on <em>any</em> object and passing the name of the method you want to reify:</p>

<pre><code>m = 'Hello'.method(:length)
m.() # =&gt; 5
</code></pre>

<p><code>Method</code>s respond to <code>to_proc</code>, so you can pass them anywhere you could pass a block:</p>

<pre><code>[1, 2, 3].each(&amp;method(:puts))
# 1
# 2
# 3
</code></pre>

<p>An <code>UnboundMethod</code> is a proxy for a method that hasn't been bound to a receiver yet, i.e. a method for which <code>self</code> hasn't been defined yet. You cannot call an <code>UnboundMethod</code>, but you can <code>bind</code> it to an object (which must be an instance of the module you got the method from), which will convert it to a <code>Method</code>.</p>

<p><code>UnboundMethod</code> objects are created by calling one of the methods from the <code>Module#instance_method</code> family, passing the name of the method as an argument.</p>

<pre><code>u = String.instance_method(:length)

u.()
# NoMethodError: undefined method `call' for #&lt;UnboundMethod: String#length&gt;

u.bind(42)
# TypeError: bind argument must be an instance of String

u.bind('Hello').() # =&gt; 5
</code></pre>

<h1>Generalized callable objects</h1>

<p>Like I already hinted at above: there's not much special about <code>Proc</code>s and <code>Method</code>s. <em>Any</em> object that responds to <code>call</code> can be called and <em>any</em> object that responds to <code>to_proc</code> can be converted to a <code>Proc</code> and thus unwrapped into a block and passed to a method which expects a block.</p>

</pre></p>
","2988","","<p>The answer to this question, as to pretty much <em>every</em> language design question is: ""Just because"". Language design is a series of mostly subjective trade-offs. And for most of those subjective trade-offs, the <em>only</em> correct answer to the question why something is the way it is, is simply ""because Matz said so"".</p>

<p>There are certainly other choices:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Lisp doesn't have operators <em>at all</em>. <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>::</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>=</code> and so on are simply normal legal function names (variable names, actually), just like <code>foo</code> or <code>bar?</code></p>

<pre><code>(plus 1 2)
(+ 1 2)
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Smalltalk <em>almost</em> doesn't have operators. The only special casing Smalltalk has is that methods which consist only of operator characters do not have to end with a colon. In particular, since there are no operators, all method calls have the same precedence and are evaluated strictly left-to-right: <code>2 + 3 * 4</code> is <code>20</code>, not <code>14</code>.</p>

<pre><code>1 plus: 2
1 + 2
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Scala <em>almost</em> doesn't have operators. Just like Lisp and Smalltalk, <code>*</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>#:::</code> and so on are simply legal method names. (Actually, they are also legal class, trait, type and field names.) <em>Any</em> method can be called either with or without a dot. If you use the form without the dot and the method takes only a single argument, then you can leave off the brackets as well. Scala <em>does</em> have precedence, though, although it is not user-definable; it is simply determined by the first character of the name. As an added twist, operator method names that end with a colon are inverted or right-associative, i.e. <code>a :: b</code> is equivalent to <code>b.::(a)</code> and not <code>a.::(b)</code>.</p>

<pre><code>1.plus(2)
1 plus(2)
1 plus 2
1.+(2)
1 +(2)
1 + 2
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>In Haskell, any function whose name consists of operator symbols is considered an operator. Any function can be treated as an operator by enclosing it in backticks and any operator can be treated as a function by enclosing it in brackets. In addition, the programmer can freely define associativity, fixity and precedence for user-defined operators.</p>

<pre><code>plus 1 2
1 `plus` 2
(+) 1 2
1 + 2
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>There is no particular reason why Ruby couldn't support user-defined operators in a style similar to Scala. There <em>is</em> a reason why Ruby can't support arbitrary methods in operator position, simply because</p>

<pre><code>foo plus bar
</code></pre>

<p>is <em>already</em> legal, and thus this would be a backwards-incompatible change.</p>

<p>Another thing to consider is that Ruby wasn't actually fully designed in advance. It was designed through its implementation. Which means that in a lot of places, the implementation is leaking through. For example, there is absolutely no logical reason why</p>

<pre><code>puts(!true)
</code></pre>

<p>is legal but</p>

<pre><code>puts(not true)
</code></pre>

<p>isn't. The only reason <em>why</em> this is so, is because Matz used an LALR(1) parser to parse a non-LALR(1) language. If he had designed the language <em>first</em>, he would have never picked an LALR(1) parser in the first place, and the expression would be legal.</p>

<p>The <code>Refinement</code> feature currently being discussed on <code>ruby-core</code> is another example. The way it is currently specified, will make it <em>impossible</em> to optimize method calls and inline methods, <em>even if the program in question doesn't actually use <code>Refinement</code>s at all</em>. With just a simple tweak, it can be just as expressive and powerful, <em>and</em> ensure that the pessimization cost is only incurred for scopes that actually <em>use</em> <code>Refinement</code>s. Apparently, the sole reason <em>why</em> it was specified this way, is that a) it was easier to prototype this way, and b) YARV doesn't <em>have</em> an optimizer, so nobody even bothered to think about the implications (well, nobody except Charles Oliver Nutter).</p>

<p>So, for basically <em>any</em> question you have about Ruby's design, the answer will almost always be either ""because Matz said so"" or ""because in 1993 it was easier to implement that way"".</p>

<p>That's wrong. BDD and TDD have absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with testing. None. Nada. Zilch. Zip. Nix. Not in the slightest.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, TDD has the word ""test"" in pretty much everything (not only in its name, but also in test framework, unit test, <code>TestCase</code> (the class you tpyically inherit from), <code>FooTest</code> (the class which typically holds your tests), <code>testBar</code> (the typical naming pattern for a test method), plus a lot test-related terminology such as ""assertion"" and ""verification"") which leads some people to believe that it actually <em>does</em> have something to do with tests. So, some smart people said: ""Hey, let's just change the name"" to remove any potential for confusion.</p>

<li>Unit &rarr; Behavior</li>

"<p>I'd like to implement a class in Ruby that's comparable (using the <code>&lt;=&gt;</code> operator) with any Fixnum, <em>and vice-versa</em>. This will ultimately be used in a range. Here is an outline of my class:</p>

<pre><code>class N
  include Comparable
  attr :offset
  def initialize(offset = 0)
    @offset = offset
  end
  def succ
    N.new(@offset + 1)
  end
  def +(offset)
    N.new(@offset + offset)
  end
  def &lt;=&gt;(other)
    return @offset &lt;=&gt; other.offset if other.kind_of? N
    return 1  # N is greater than everything else
  end
end

def n; N.new(0); end
</code></pre>

<p>Now this works great when used in <code>n..n+2</code> and <code>n..999</code>, but not in <code>1..n</code>. This is due to the fact that <code>n &lt;=&gt; 1</code> works but <code>1 &lt;=&gt; n</code> does not (returns <strong><em>nil</em></strong>).</p>

<p>Is there any way I can get Fixnum to treat my N class as a comparable object? Your thoughts are appreciated :)</p>
","2988","","<p>If you want to implement your own number type, you <em>must</em> implement <code>coerce</code>:</p>

n = N.new

1 &lt;=&gt; n # =&gt; -1

<p>All of Ruby's builtin number types in the core library, all number types in the standard library, as well as all third-party number types use the <code>coerce</code> protocol to find a common type in order to make operators such as <code>+</code>, <code>*</code> and <code>==</code> commutative and <code>-</code>, <code>/</code> and <code>&lt;=&gt;</code> symmetric.</p>

"<p>I'm reading the Metaprogramming section of <em>Programming Ruby 1.9</em> and I'm having trouble understanding what's going on <em>internally</em> between <code>class_eval</code>/<code>class_exec</code> vs. <code>instance_eval</code>/<code>instance_exec</code>.</p>

<p>So first of all, my understanding is that <code>def</code> adds a method to the method table of <code>self</code> (the class object):</p>

<pre><code>class A
  puts self  # =&gt; A
  def foo; 42; end  # added to the method table of self, so becomes an instance method
end
A.new.foo  # =&gt; 42
</code></pre>

<p>And if we use <code>class_eval</code>, we get the same behavior:</p>

<pre><code>A.class_eval do
  puts self  # =&gt; A
  def bar; 42; end  # same as above
end
A.new.bar  # =&gt; 42
</code></pre>

<p>But somehow in the <code>instance_eval</code> case, things are different:</p>

<pre><code>A.instance_eval do
  puts self  # =&gt; A
  def baz; 42; end  # added to the method table of an anonymous
                    # singleton class of self, so becomes a class method
end
puts A.baz  # =&gt; 42

s = 'string'
s.instance_eval do ... end  # same behavior, so now def creates an instance method
</code></pre>

<p>So I understand the functional difference between <code>class_eval</code> and <code>instance_eval</code>.</p>

<p>But the contexts inside the <code>class_eval</code> and <code>instance_eval</code> blocks look <em>exactly</em> the same to me -- in particular, <code>self</code> points to the same object, and the <code>local_variables</code> are the same.  So what's going on inside the blocks (internally) that's making <code>def</code> act different?</p>

<p>Is there some piece of documentation I could read?  The RDoc for <a href=""http://ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Object.html#M000334"">instance_eval</a> and <a href=""http://ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Module.html#M001650"">class_eval</a> doesn't help.  Looking at the source, <a href=""http://ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Object.src/M000334.html"">instance_eval</a> seems to set up a singleton class object whereas <a href=""http://ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Module.src/M001650.html"">class_eval</a> doesn't -- but is this difference visible outside the C code, on the Ruby level?</p>
","2988","","<p>Just to add to @krusty.ar's answer: <code>def</code> and <code>define_method</code> add methods to the current <em>method definition context</em> (I believe that's what it's called, I'm not sure), not to the current <code>self</code>.</p>

<p>It's just that inside of a module, class or singleton class body, those two happen to be the same.</p>

<p>But, for example, in a script body (aka top-level), <code>self</code> is the <code>main</code> object, but the current method definition context is <code>Object</code>.</p>

"<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1607947/practicality-of-compiling-another-language-to-javascript"">Another post</a> questioned how practical it is to compile languages into Javascript.  Practicality aside, what interpreters translate from some language <em>X</em> to Javascript and were implemented in Javascript?  I'm especially interested in the cases where <em>X</em> wasn't designed with the intention of targeting Javascript.  Even if the interpreter isn't totally finished I'd like to hear about it.</p>

<p>You may be curious about the motivation for this question.  Javascript certainly can't leverage as much power as assembler, but the flexibility for code distribution and execution may sometimes outweigh that cost.</p>

<p>One use case for these interpreters is a model for teaching and learning programming languages.  Consider how useful it is to have a Javascript interpreter in the interactive book <a href=""http://eloquentjavascript.net/"" rel=""nofollow""><em>Eloquent Javascript</em></a>.  Sure, there may be a performance hit over compiling it natively, but in some situations the cost is certainly worth it.  And yes, I realize it's always an option to rely on the server to compile or interpret code, but I'm specifically interested in client-side approaches.</p>

<hr/>

<p><em>UPDATE</em>:  A lot of responses include references to compilers that weren't implemented in Javascript.  I just want to stress that the interpreter itself should be implemented in Javascript so that both it and the source language code could run on the browser on your grandparent's computer.</p>

"<p>How to use string methods on utf-8 characters ?</p>

<p>For example I have a string with a cyrillic characters so when I use string.upcase it<code>s dosen</code>t work</p>
","2988","","<p>Ruby only supports case conversions on the letters <code>A</code>&ndash;<code>Z</code> and <code>a</code>&ndash;<code>z</code>.</p>

<p>The reason for this is simply that case conversions for other letters aren't well defined. For example, in Turkish <code>'I'.downcase # =&gt; 'ı'</code> and <code>i.upcase # =&gt; 'İ'</code>, but in French <code>'I'.downcase # =&gt; 'i'</code> and <code>i.upcase # =&gt; 'I'</code>. Ruby would have to know not only the character encoding, but also the language to do that correctly.</p>

<p>Even worse, in German</p>

<pre><code>'MASSE'.downcase
</code></pre>

<p>is <em>either</em></p>

<pre><code>'maße'   # ""measurements""
'masse'  # ""mass""
</code></pre>

<p>In other words: you need to actually <em>understand</em> the text, i.e. you need a full-blown AI, to do case conversions correctly.</p>

<p>And I myself have actually accidentally constructed a sentence once, which was undecidable <em>even for a human</em>.</p>

<p>In short: it's simply impossible to do correctly, which is why Ruby doesn't do it <em>at all</em>. There are third-party libraries, however, like the Unicode library and ActiveSupport, which <em>do</em> support a somewhat larger subset of characters.</p>

","2988","","<pre><code>h.sort_by {|k, v| [v, k] }

</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Note: if you simply want to delegate to some property's <code>&lt;=&gt;</code> method, (i.e. sort by a key rather than a general comparison function) it is generally prefered to use <code>sort_by</code> instead of <code>sort</code>.

"<p>Can we expose interfaces in Ruby like we do in java and enforce the Ruby modules or classes to implement the methods defined by interface. </p>

<p>One way is to use inheritance and method_missing to achieve the same but is there any other more appropriate approach available ?</p>
","2988","","<p>Ruby has <em>Interfaces</em> just like any other language.</p>

<p>Note that you have to be careful not to conflate the concept of the <em>Interface</em>, which is an abstract specification of the responsibilities, guarantees and protocols of a unit with the concept of the <code>interface</code> which is a keyword in the Java, C# and VB.NET programming languages. In Ruby, we use the former all the time, but the latter simply doesn't exist.</p>

<p>It is very important to distinguish the two. What's important is the <em>Interface</em>, not the <code>interface</code>. The <code>interface</code> tells you pretty much nothing useful. Nothing demonstrates this better than the <em>marker interfaces</em> in Java, which are interfaces that have no members at all: just take a look at <a href=""http://Download.Oracle.Com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/Serializable.html""><code>java.io.Serializable</code></a> and <a href=""http://Download.Oracle.Com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Cloneable.html""><code>java.lang.Cloneable</code></a>; those two <code>interface</code>s mean <em>very</em> different things, yet they have the <em>exact same</em> signature.</p>

<p>So, if two <code>interface</code>s that mean different things, have the same signature, what <em>exactly</em> is the <code>interface</code> even guaranteeing you?</p>

<p>Another good example:</p>

<pre><code>package java.util;

interface List&lt;E&gt; implements Collection&lt;E&gt;, Iterable&lt;E&gt; {
    void add(int index, E element)
        throws UnsupportedOperationException, ClassCastException,
            NullPointerException, IllegalArgumentException,
            IndexOutOfBoundsException;
}
</code></pre>

<p>What is the <em>Interface</em> of <code>java.util.List&lt;E&gt;.add</code>?</p>

<ul>
<li>that the length of the collection does not decrease</li>
<li>that all the items that were in the collection before are still there</li>
<li>that <code>element</code> is in the collection</li>
</ul>

<p>And which of those actually shows up in the <code>interface</code>? None! There is nothing in the <code>interface</code> that says that the <code>Add</code> method must even <em>add</em> at all, it might just as well <em>remove</em> an element from the collection.</p>

<p>This is a perfectly valid implementation of that <code>interface</code>:</p>

<pre><code>class MyCollection&lt;E&gt; implements java.util.List&lt;E&gt; {
    void add(int index, E element)
        throws UnsupportedOperationException, ClassCastException,
            NullPointerException, IllegalArgumentException,
            IndexOutOfBoundsException {
        remove(element);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Another example: where in <a href=""http://Download.Oracle.Com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Set.html""><code>java.util.Set&lt;E&gt;</code></a> does it actually say that it is, you know, a <em>set</em>? Nowhere! Or more precisely, in the documentation. In English.</p>

<p>In pretty much all cases of <code>interfaces</code>, both from Java and .NET, all the <em>relevant</em> information is actually in the docs, not in the types. So, if the types don't tell you anything interesting anyway, why keep them at all? Why not stick just to documentation? And that's exactly what Ruby does.</p>

<p>Note that there are <em>other</em> languages in which the <em>Interface</em> can actually be described in a meaningful way. However, those languages typically don't call the construct which describes the <em>Interface</em> ""<code>interface</code>"", they call it <code>type</code>. In a dependently-typed programming language, you can for example express the properties that a <code>sort</code> function returns a collection of the same length as the original, that every element which is in the original is also in the sorted collection and that no bigger element appears before a smaller element.</p>

<p>So, in short: Ruby does not have an equivalent to a Java <code>interface</code>. It <em>does</em> however have an equivalent to a Java <em>Interface</em>, and its exactly the same as in Java: documentation.</p>

<p>Also, just like in Java, <em>Acceptance Tests</em> can be used to specify *Interface*s as well.</p>

<p>In particular, in Ruby, the <em>Interface</em> of an object is determined by what it can <em>do</em>, not what <code>class</code> is is, or what <code>module</code> it mixes in. Any object that has a <code>&lt;&lt;</code> method can be appended to. This is very useful in unit tests, where you can simply pass in an <code>Array</code> or a <code>String</code> instead of a more complicated <code>Logger</code>, even though <code>Array</code> and <code>Logger</code> do not share an explicit <code>interface</code> apart from the fact that they both have a method called <code>&lt;&lt;</code>.</p>

<p>Another example is <a href=""http://RubyDoc.Info/docs/ruby-stdlib/1.9.2/StringIO/""><code>StringIO</code></a>, which implements the same <em>Interface</em> as <code>IO</code> and thus a large portion of the <em>Interface</em> of <code>File</code>, but without sharing any common ancestor besides <code>Object</code>.</p>

<p>I've seen it used a few times lately but can't figure out what it does. Can anyone illustrate how it works?</p>
","2988","","<p>Just like with every other method in Ruby (or actually pretty much any object-oriented language),</p>

<pre><code>a === b
</code></pre>

<p>means whatever the author of <code>a</code>'s class wants it to mean.</p>

<p>However, if you don't want to confuse the heck out of your colleagues, the convention is that <code>===</code> is the <em>case subsumption</em> operator. Basically, it's a boolean operator which asks the question ""<em>If I have a drawer labelled <code>a</code> would it make sense to put <code>b</code> in that drawer?</em>""</p>

<p>An alternative formulation is ""<em>If <code>a</code> described a set, would <code>b</code> be a member of that set?</em>""</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code> (1..5) === 3           # =&gt; true
 (1..5) === 6           # =&gt; false

Integer === 42          # =&gt; true
Integer === 'fourtytwo' # =&gt; false

  /ell/ === 'Hello'     # =&gt; true
  /ell/ === 'Foobar'    # =&gt; false
</code></pre>

<p>The main usage for the <code>===</code> operator is in <code>case</code> expressions, since</p>

<pre><code>case foo
when bar
  baz
when quux
  flurb
else
  blarf
end
</code></pre>

<p>gets translated to something (roughly) like</p>

<pre><code>_temp = foo

if bar === _temp
  baz
elsif quux === _temp
  flurb
else
  blarf
end
</code></pre>

<p>Note that if you want to search for this operator, it is usually called the <em>triple equals operator</em> or <em>threequals operator</em> or <em>case equality operator</em>. I really dislike those names, because this operator has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with equality.</p>

<p>In particular, one would expect equality to be symmetric: if <code>a</code> is equal to <code>b</code>, then <code>b</code> better be also equal to <code>a</code>. Also, one would expect equality to be transitive: if <code>a == b</code> and <code>b == c</code>, then <code>a == c</code>. While there is no way to actually <em>guarantee</em> that in a single-dispatch language like Ruby, you should at least make an effort to preserve this property (for example, by following the <code>coerce</code> protocol).</p>

<p>However, for <code>===</code> there is no expectation of either symmetry or transitivity. In fact, it is very much by design <em>not</em> symmetric. That's why I don't like calling it anything that even <em>remotely</em> resembles equality. It's also why I think, it should have been called something else like <code>~~~</code> or whatever.</p>

<pre><code>class Foo
  def bar
    'Hello'
  end
end 

class ExtendedFoo &lt; Foo
  def bar
    super + ' World'
  end
end

ExtendedFoo.new.bar # =&gt; 'Hello World'
</code></pre>

<p>This works, if you control creation of the <code>Foo</code> objects. Just change every place which creates a <code>Foo</code> to instead create an <code>ExtendedFoo</code>. This works even better if you use the Dependency Injection Design Pattern, the Factory Method Design Pattern, the Factory Design Pattern or something along those lines.</p>

<h1>Delegation</h1>

<p>If you <em>do not</em> control creation of the <code>Foo</code> objects, for example because they are created by a framework that is outside of your control (like Ruby on Rails for example), then you could use the Wrapper Design Pattern:</p>

<pre><code>require 'delegate'

class Foo
  def bar
    'Hello'
  end
end 

class WrappedFoo &lt; DelegateClass(Foo)
  def initialize(wrapped_foo)
    super
  end

  def bar
    super + ' World'
  end
end

foo = Foo.new # this is not actually in your code, it comes from somewhere else

wrapped_foo = WrappedFoo.new(foo) # this is under your control

wrapped_foo.bar # =&gt; 'Hello World'
</code></pre>

<p>Basically, at the boundary of the system, where the <code>Foo</code> object comes into your code, you wrap it into another object, and then use <em>that</em> object instead of the original one everywhere else in your code.</p>

<h1>Mixin Inheritance (broken)</h1>

<p>You might be tempted to do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>class Foo
  def bar
    'Hello'
  end
end 

module FooExtensions
  def bar
    super + ' World'
  end
end

class Foo
  include FooExtensions
end
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately, that won't work. It's a good idea, because it uses inheritance, which means that you can use <code>super</code>. However, <code>include</code> inserts the mixin <em>above</em> the class in the inheritance hierarchy, which means that <code>FooExtensions#bar</code> will never be called (and if it <em>were</em> called, the <code>super</code> would not actually refer to <code>Foo#bar</code> but rather to <code>Object#bar</code> which doesn't exist), since <code>Foo#bar</code> will always be found first.</p>

<h1><code>alias_method</code> chain</h1>

<p>The problem we are having with our monkey patching is that when we overwrite the method, the method is gone, so we cannot call it anymore. So, let's just make a backup copy!</p>

<pre><code>class Foo
  def bar
    'Hello'
  end
end 

class Foo
  alias_method :old_bar, :bar

  def bar
    old_bar + ' World'
  end
end

Foo.new.bar # =&gt; 'Hello World'
Foo.new.old_bar # =&gt; 'Hello'
</code></pre>

<p>The problem with this is that we have now polluted the namespace with a superfluous <code>old_bar</code> method. This method will show up in our documentation, it will show up in code completion in our IDEs, it will show up during reflection. Also, it still can be called, but presumably we monkey patched it, because we didn't like its behavior in the first place, so we might not want other people to call it.</p>

<h1>Method Wrapping</h1>

<p>So, the big question is: how can we hold on to the <code>bar</code> method, without actually keeping around an <em>actual method</em>? The answer lies, as it does so often, in functional programming. We get a hold of the method as an actual <em>object</em>, and we use a closure (i.e. a block) to make sure that we <em>and only we</em> hold on to that object:</p>

<pre><code>class Foo
  def bar
    'Hello'
  end
end 

class Foo
  old_bar = instance_method(:bar)

  define_method(:bar) do
    old_bar.bind(self).() + ' World'
  end
end

Foo.new.bar # =&gt; 'Hello World'
</code></pre>

<p>Of the methods that use actual monkey patching instead of inheritance or delegation, this is the cleanest: since <code>old_bar</code> is just a local variable, it will go out of scope at the end of the class body, and it is impossible to access it from anywhere, <em>even</em> using reflection! And since <code>define_method</code> takes a block, and blocks close over their surrounding lexical environment (which is <em>why</em> we are using <code>define_method</code> instead of <code>def</code> here), <em>it</em> (and <em>only</em> it) will still have access to <code>old_bar</code>, even after it has gone out of scope.</p>

<p>Short explanation:</p>

<pre><code>old_bar = instance_method(:bar)
</code></pre>

<p>Here we are wrapping the <code>bar</code> method into an <code>UnboundMethod</code> method object and assigning it to the local variable <code>old_bar</code>. This means, we now have a way to hold on to <code>bar</code> even after it has been overwritten.</p>

<pre><code>old_bar.bind(self)
</code></pre>

<p>This is a bit tricky. Basically, in Ruby (and in pretty much all single-dispatch based OO languages), a method is bound to a specific receiver object, called <code>self</code> in Ruby. In other words: a method always knows what object it was called on, it knows what its <code>self</code> is. But, we grabbed the method directly from a class, how does it know what its <code>self</code> is?</p>

<p>Well, it doesn't, which is why we need to <code>bind</code> our <code>UnboundMethod</code> to an object first, which will return a <code>Method</code> object that we can then call. (<code>UnboundMethod</code>s cannot be called, because they don't know what to do without knowing their <code>self</code>.)</p>

<p>And what do we <code>bind</code> it to? We simply <code>bind</code> it to ourselves, that way it will behave <em>exactly</em> like the original <code>bar</code> would have!</p>

<p>Lastly, we need to call the <code>Method</code> that is returned from <code>bind</code>. In Ruby 1.9, there is some nifty new syntax for that (<code>.()</code>), but if you are on 1.8, you can simply use the <code>call</code> method; that's what <code>.()</code> gets translated to anyway.</p>

<p>Here are a couple of other questions, where some of those concepts are explained:</p>

<h1>The Future: Ruby 2.0</h1>

<p>In Ruby 2.0, there is a way to make this easier.</p>

<h2><a href=""http://Ruby-Doc.Org/core-2.0/Module.html#method-i-prepend"" rel=""nofollow""><code>Module#prepend</code></a>: Mixin Inheritance (fixed)</h2>

<p>I like this, because it just uses inheritance, without the need for new keywords, method combinators, new semantics or anything like that.</p>

<p>Remember above in the <em>Mixin Inheritance (broken)</em> section, when we said that the problem is that the mixin gets inserted <em>above</em> the class in the inheritance hierarchy? Well, <a href=""http://Ruby-Doc.Org/core-2.0/Module.html#method-i-prepend"" rel=""nofollow""><code>Module#prepend</code></a> is simply a new method which does the same thing as <code>Module#include</code>, except it mixes in the module directly <em>below</em> the class:</p>

<pre><code>class Foo
  def bar
    'Hello'
  end
end 

module FooExtensions
  def bar
    super + ' World'
  end
end

class Foo
  prepend FooExtensions # the only change to above: prepend instead of include
end

Foo.new.bar # =&gt; 'Hello World'
</code></pre>

<p>This code actually works right now, if you get yourself a recent checkout of the trunk branch of the YARV source code and compile it.</p>

<h2>Rebind module method</h2>

<p>Binding of methods were available in earlier Ruby versions however they always had to be from same class or inheritor of the class. Since Ruby 2.0 you can rebind any module method</p>

<pre><code>module Foo
  def bar
    ""Hello #{who}""
  end
end

class Car
  def bar
    'Different hello'
  end

  def who
    'Tomas'
  end
end

car = Car.new
car.bar # =&gt; 'Different hello'
Foo.instance_method(:bar).bind(car).call # =&gt; ""Hello Tomas""
car.bar # =&gt; 'Different hello'
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Other competing ideas that did not make it into Ruby were:</p>

<h2>Method Combinators</h2>

<p>One idea is the idea of method combinators from CLOS. This is basically a very lightweight version of a subset of Aspect-Oriented Programming.</p>

<p>Using syntax like</p>

<pre><code>class Foo
  def bar:before
    # will always run before bar, when bar is called
  end

  def bar:after
    # will always run after bar, when bar is called
    # may or may not be able to access and/or change bar's return value
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>you would be able to ""hook into"" the execution of the <code>bar</code> method.</p>

<p>It is however not quite clear if and how you get access to <code>bar</code>'s return value within <code>bar:after</code>. Maybe we could (ab)use the <code>super</code> keyword?</p>

<pre><code>class Foo
  def bar
    'Hello'
  end
end 

class Foo
  def bar:after
    super + ' World'
  end
end
</code></pre>

<h2><code>old</code> keyword</h2>

<p>This idea adds a new keyword similar to <code>super</code>, which allows you to call the <em>overwritten</em> method the same way <code>super</code> lets you call the <em>overridden</em> method:</p>

<pre><code>class Foo
  def bar
    'Hello'
  end
end 

class Foo
  def bar
    old + ' World'
  end
end

Foo.new.bar # =&gt; 'Hello World'
</code></pre>

<p>The main problem with this is that it is backwards incompatible: if you have method called <code>old</code>, you will no longer be able to call it!</p>

<h2><code>redef</code> keyword</h2>

<p>Similar to above, but instead of adding a new keyword for <em>calling</em> the overwritten method and leaving <code>def</code> alone, we add a new keyword for <em>redefining</em> methods. This is backwards compatible, since the syntax currently is illegal anyway:</p>

<pre><code>class Foo
  def bar
    'Hello'
  end
end 

class Foo
  redef bar
    old + ' World'
  end
end

Foo.new.bar # =&gt; 'Hello World'
</code></pre>

<p>Instead of adding <em>two</em> new keywords, we could also redefine the meaning of <code>super</code> inside <code>redef</code>:</p>

<pre><code>class Foo
  def bar
    'Hello'
  end
end 

class Foo
  redef bar
    super + ' World'
  end
end

Foo.new.bar # =&gt; 'Hello World'
</code></pre>

"<p>I know that security through obscurity is frowned upon and considered not really secure, but isn't a password security through obscurity?  It's only secure so long as no one finds it.</p>

<p>Is it just a matter of the level of obscurity? (i.e. a good password well salted and hashed is impractical to break)</p>

<p>Note I'm not asking about the process of saving passwords (Assume they are properly hashed and salted).  I'm asking about the whole idea using a password, which is a piece of information, which if known could compromise a person's account.  </p>

<p>Or am I misunderstanding what security through obscurity means?  I guess that's what I assume it to mean, that is there exists some information which if known would compromise a system (in this case, the system being defined as whatever the password is meant to protect)</p>
","2988","","<p>Maybe it's easier to understand what Security-by-Obscurity is about, by looking at something that is in some sense the <em>opposite</em>: <em>Auguste Kerckhoffs's Second Principle</em> (now simply known usually as <em>Kerckhoffs's Principle</em>), formulated in 1883 in two articles on <em>La Cryptographie Militaire</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[The cipher] must not be required to be secret, and it must be able to fall into the hands of the enemy without inconvenience.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Claude Shannon reformulated it as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The enemy knows the system.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And Eric Raymond as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Any security software design that doesn't assume the enemy possesses the source code is already untrustworthy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An alternative formulation of that principle is that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The security of the system must depend <em>only</em> of the secrecy of the key, not the secrecy of the system.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, we can simply define Security-by-Obscurity to be any system that does not follow that principle, and thus we cleverly out-defined the password :-)</p>

<p>There are two basic reasons why this Principle makes sense:</p>

<ol>
<li>Keys tend to be much smaller than systems, therefore they are easier to protect.</li>
<li>Compromising the secrecy of a key only compromises the secrecy of all communications protected by that key, compromising the secrecy of the system compromises <em>all</em> communications.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that it doesn't say anywhere that you can't keep your system secret. It just says you shouldn't depend on it. You may use Security-by-Obscurity as an <em>additional</em> line of defense, you just shouldn't assume that it actually works.</p>

<p>In general, however, cryptography is <em>hard</em>, and cryptographic systems are complex, therefore you pretty much <em>need</em> to publish it, to get as many eyeballs on it as possible. There are only very few organizations on this planet that actually have the necessary smart people to design cryptographic systems in secrecy: in the past, when mathematicians were patriots and governments were rich, those were the NSA and the KGB, right now it's IBM and a couple of years from now it's gonna be the Chinese Secret Service and international crime syndicates.</p>

"<p>Is there something like WindowBuilder for Scala?</p>
","2988","","<p>I don't know of any WYSIWYG GUI builder for Scala. But you don't need one. In fact, strictly speaking, Scala doesn't <em>have</em> a GUI; it just uses the underlying platform's GUI (or GUIs).</p>

<p>So, the JVM port of Scala uses AWT, Swing or SWT and the CLI port of Scala uses WinForms or WPF. I've heard rumors of ports of Scala to the ECMAScript runtime and the Objective-C runtime, and those would presumable use HTML5 and Quartz/Cocoa, respectively.</p>

<p>This means that you can just use the existing tools, like Expression Blend for WPF or Matisse for Swing.</p>

<p>Note, however, that at least for Swing, there is the brilliant <code>scala.swing</code> library, which contains an embedded DSL for building GUIs programmatically.

<p>In 99% of the <em>rest</em> of the cases, the computer is looking in the wrong place.

<p>Alternatively, if you do not want to <code>require</code> a file from the <code>$LOAD_PATH</code> but rather relative to the position of the file that is <em>doing</em> the <code>require</code>ing, then you need to use <code>require_relative</code>.</p>

"<p>Just curious: sure, we all know that the general case of type inference for generics is undecidable.

<p>To you maybe, but not to me.</p>

<p>To me, the huge hole this rips into the type system is simply not acceptable. If you want to throw type-safety out the window like that, I'd much rather use a dynamically typed language that was actually <em>designed</em> for this stuff.</p>

<p>The fact that arrays are covariant, even though this is known to break type-safety, is bad enough, now you want to break it for <em>everything</em>?</p>

<p>This goes to the very heart of what a type system is about. All a type system does is <em>reject programs</em>. And because of Rice's Theorem, those rejected program include perfectly well-typed, type-safe programs.</p>

<p>That is a <em>huge</em> cost. Taking away expressivity, preventing me from writing useful programs. In order to justify that cost, the type system better pay be back <em>big time</em>. It has basically two ways of doing that: giving back expressivity at the type-level it took away at the program-level and type-safety.</p>

<p>The former is out, simply because C#'s type system isn't powerful enough to let me express anything even remotely interesting. This leaves only the latter, and it is already on pretty shaky ground because of <code>null</code>, covariant arrays, unrestricted side-effects, <code>unsafe</code> and so on. By making generic types automatically covariant, you more or less completely take away the last shred of type-safety that is left.</p>

<p>There are only <em>very few</em> cases where <code>S &lt;: T ⇒ G&lt;S&gt; &lt;: G&lt;T&gt;</code> is actually type-safe. (<code>IEnumerable</code> is one such example.) And there are probably equally many cases where only <code>S &lt;: T ⇒ G&lt;T&gt; &lt;: G&lt;S&gt;</code> is type-safe. (<code>IObservable</code>, <code>IComparer</code>, <code>IComparable</code>, <code>IEqualityComparer</code>.) Generally, <em>neither</em> <code>G&lt;S&gt; &lt;: G&lt;T&gt;</code> nor <code>G&lt;T&gt; &lt;: G&lt;S&gt;</code> are type-safe.</p>

"<p>I'm trying to understand clojure protocols and what problem they are supposed to solve. Does anyone have a clear explanation of the whats and whys of clojure protocols?</p>
","2988","","<p>The purpose of Protocols in Clojure is to solve the Expression Problem in an efficient manner.</p>

<p>So, what's the Expression Problem? It refers to the basic problem of extensibility: our programs manipulate data types using operations. As our programs evolve, we need to extend them with new data types and new operations. And particularly, we want to be able to add new operations which work with the existing data types, and we want to add new data types which work with the existing operations. <em>And</em> we want this to be true <em>extension</em>, i.e. we don't want to modify the <em>existing</em> program, we want to respect the existing abstractions, we want our extensions to be separate modules, in separate namespaces, separately compiled, separately deployed, separately type checked. We want them to be type-safe. [Note: not all of these make sense in all languages. But, for example, the goal to have them type-safe makes sense even in a language like Clojure. Just because we can't statically <em>check</em> type-safety doesn't mean that we want our code to randomly break, right?]</p>

<p>The Expression Problem is, how do you actually provide such extensibility in a language?</p>

<p>It turns out that for typical naive implementations of procedural and/or functional programming, it is very easy to add new operations (procedures, functions), but very hard to add new data types, since basically the operations work with the data types using some sort of case discrimination (<code>switch</code>, <code>case</code>, pattern matching) and you need to add new cases to them, i.e. modify existing code.</p>

<p>And for typical naive OO, you have the exact opposite problem: it is easy to add new data types which work with the existing operations (either by inheriting or overriding them), but it is hard to add new operations, since that basically means modifying existing classes/objects.</p>

<p>Several languages have several constructs for solving the Expression Problem: Haskell has typeclasses, Scala has implicit arguments, Racket has Units, Go has Interfaces, CLOS and Clojure have Multimethods. There are also ""solutions"" which <em>attempt</em> to solve it, but fail in one way or another: Interfaces and Extension Methods in C# and Java, Monkeypatching in Ruby, Python, ECMAScript.</p>

<p>Note that Clojure actually already <em>has</em> a mechanism for solving the Expression Problem: Multimethods. The problem that OO has with the EP is that they bundle operations and types together. With Multimethods they are separate. The problem that FP has is that they bundle the operation and the case discrimination together. Again, with Multimethods they are separate.</p>

<p>So, let's compare Protocols with Multimethods, since both do the same thing. Or, to put it another way: Why Protocols if we already <em>have</em> Multimethods?</p>

<p>The main thing Protocols offer over Multimethods is Grouping: you can group multiple functions together and say ""these 3 functions <em>together</em> form Protocol <code>Foo</code>"". You cannot do that with Multimethods, they always stand on their own. For example, you could declare that a <code>Stack</code> Protocol consists of <em>both</em> a <code>push</code> and a <code>pop</code> function <em>together</em>.</p>

<p>So, why not just add the capability to group Multimethods together? There's a purely pragmatic reason, and it is why used the word ""efficient"" in my introductory sentence: performance.</p>

<p>Clojure is a hosted language. I.e. it is specifically designed to be run on top of <em>another</em> language's platform. And it turns out that pretty much any platform that you would like Clojure to run on (JVM, CLI, ECMAScript, Objective-C) has specialized high-performance support for dispatching <em>only</em> on the type of <em>only</em> the first argument. Clojure Multimethods OTOH dispatch on <em>arbitrary properties</em> of <em>all arguments</em>.</p>

<p>So, Protocols restrict you to dispatch <em>only</em> on the <em>first</em> argument and <em>only</em> on its type (or as a special case on <code>nil</code>).</p>

<p>This is not a limitation on the idea of Protocols per se, it is a pragmatic choice to get access to the performance optimizations of the underlying platform. In particular, it means that Protocols have a trivial mapping to JVM/CLI Interfaces, which makes them very fast. Fast enough, in fact, to be able to rewrite those parts of Clojure which are currently written in Java or C# in Clojure itself.</p>

<p>Clojure has actually already had Protocols since version 1.0: <code>Seq</code> is a Protocol, for example. But until 1.2, you couldn't write Protocols in Clojure, you had to write them in the host language.</p>

"<p>I have defined simple grammar for parsing string and number using Treetop as below.</p>

<pre><code>grammar Simple

</code></pre>

<p>Ruby:</p>

<pre><code>parser = SimpleParser.new
parser.parse('123abc wer') # =&gt; nil
</code></pre>

<p>I expect the parser to return <strong>string node</strong> but look like the parser <strong>could not understand</strong> the input. Any idea would be appreciated.</p>
","2988","","<p>In Treetop (and PEGs in general, actually) the choice operator is <em>ordered</em>, unlike most other parsing formalisms.</p>

<p>So, in</p>

<pre><code>rule value
  number / string
end
</code></pre>

<p>you are telling Treetop that you <em>prefer</em> <code>number</code> over <code>string</code>.</p>

<p>Your input starts with <code>1</code>, which matches <em>both</em> <code>number</code> and <code>string</code> (through <code>word</code>), but you told Treetop to prefer the <code>number</code> interpretation, so it parses it as a <code>number</code>. When it comes to the <code>a</code> in the input, it has no more rules to apply, and thus it returns nothing (<code>nil</code>), because in Treetop it is an error to not consume the entire input stream.</p>

<p>If you simply reverse the order of the choice, the entire input will interpreted as a <code>string</code> instead of a <code>number</code>:</p>

<pre><code>SyntaxNode+String0 offset=0, ""123abc wer"" (word,space,string):
  SyntaxNode offset=0, ""123abc"":
    SyntaxNode offset=0, ""1""
    SyntaxNode offset=1, ""2""
    SyntaxNode offset=2, ""3""
    SyntaxNode offset=3, ""a""
    SyntaxNode offset=4, ""b""
    SyntaxNode offset=5, ""c""
  SyntaxNode offset=6, "" "":
    SyntaxNode offset=6, "" ""
  SyntaxNode offset=7, ""wer"":
    SyntaxNode offset=7, ""w""
    SyntaxNode offset=8, ""e""
    SyntaxNode offset=9, ""r""
</code></pre>

<p>Or, you could keep the order as it is, but allow the <code>value</code> rule to be matched multiple times. Either insert a new top-level rule like this:</p>

<pre><code>rule values
  value+
end
</code></pre>

<p>or modify the <code>value</code> rule like this:</p>

<pre><code>rule value
  (number / string)+
end

"<p>I'm just exploring ruby and was wondering about the theoretical possibility of adding a method to the class of an object.  For example, define a method that takes in a parameter and would add a method to the class of that parameter (not just to the parameter object itself).  Something like this example:</p>

<pre><code>class SomeClass
end

class AnotherClass
end

alpha = SomeClass.new
beta = AnotherClass.new

def AddHelloMethodTo param

 # This is where I'm trying to
 # add a method to the class of the parameter
 def param.class.Hello 
  ""Hello""
 end

end

AddHelloMethodTo alpha
AddHelloMethodTo beta

gamma = AnotherClass.new

alpha.Hello
beta.Hello
gamma.Hello
</code></pre>

<p>(Excuse me if I have syntax errors / typos I'm REALLY new to this!)<br>
Notice how I don't call the <code>AddHelloMethodTo</code> on <code>gamma</code> but I expect Hello to be defined because I added it to the class.<br>
Is this possible?</p>
","2988","","<p>This is the closest to what you had. I took the liberty of changing it to standard Ruby coding style, but notice that the only <em>real</em> change is the first line of <code>add_hello_method_to_class_of</code>:</p>

<pre><code>class SomeClass; end
class AnotherClass; end

alpha = SomeClass.new
beta = AnotherClass.new

def add_hello_method_to_class_of(obj)
  obj.class.send(:define_method, :hello) do
    'Hello'
  end
end

add_hello_method_to_class_of(alpha)
add_hello_method_to_class_of(beta)

gamma = AnotherClass.new

alpha.hello
beta.hello
gamma.hello
</code></pre>

<p>Originally, you had</p>

<pre><code>def obj.class.hello
</code></pre>

<p>This will work, but it doesn't do what you think it does. This will add a <em>singleton method</em> to the <em>class object</em> itself, but it appears you assume that it will add an <em>instance method</em>. If you want to add an <em>instance method</em>, you need to use <code>Module#define_method</code> like this:</p>

<pre><code>obj.class.define_method(:hello)
</code></pre>

<p>Except that <code>Module#define_method</code> is <code>private</code>, so you need to use reflection to circumvent that access restriction:</p>

<pre><code>obj.class.send(:define_method, :hello)
</code></pre>

<p>Note that I also changed the name of the method from <code>add_hello_method_to</code> to <code>add_hello_method_to_class_of</code>, since, well it <em>doesn't</em> add the <code>hello</code> method to its argument, it adds it to its argument's <em>class</em>.</p>

<p>However, if you do monkey patching like this, it is generally considered good practice to use mixins instead, since then, the mixin shows up in the object's inheritance chain, which leaves anybody debugging that code at least a fighting chance to figure out where the heck that mysterious <code>hello</code> method is coming from:</p>

<pre><code># file: hello_extension.rb
module HelloExtension
  def hello
    'Hello'
  end
end

def add_hello_method_to_class_of(obj)
  obj.class.send(:include, HelloExtension)
end

# some other file
require 'hello_extension'

class SomeClass; end
class AnotherClass; end

alpha = SomeClass.new
beta = AnotherClass.new

add_hello_method_to_class_of(alpha)
add_hello_method_to_class_of(beta)

gamma = AnotherClass.new

alpha.hello
beta.hello
gamma.hello
</code></pre>

<p>Now, you can easily debug this code:</p>

<pre><code>gamma.class.ancestors
# =&gt; [AnotherClass, HelloExtension, Object, Kernel, BasicObject]
</code></pre>

<p>If someone wonders where the <code>hello</code> method is coming from, then it doesn't take much to figure out that a mixin called <code>HelloExtension</code> probably has something to do with it. And following standard Ruby naming conventions they even know to look in a file named <code>hello_extension.rb</code></p>

<p>You can even do this:</p>

<pre><code>gamma.method(:hello).source_location
# =&gt; ['hello_extension.rb', 3]

"<p>I have a simple class that defines some constants, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>module Foo
  class Bar
    BAZ = ""bof""
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>Everything is puppies and rainbows until I tell Rake to run all my <code>Test::Unit</code> tests. When it does, I get warnings:</p>

<pre><code>bar.rb:3: warning: already initialized constant BAZ
</code></pre>

<p>My habit has been to avoid these warnings by making the constant initialization conditional, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>...
BAZ = ""bof"" unless const_defined? :BAZ
...
</code></pre>

<p>This seems to solve the problem, but it is a little tedious, and I don't ever see anyone else initializing constants this way. This makes me think I might be Doing It Wrong. Is there a better way to initialize constants that won't generate warnings?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: By way of a little more detail on how I'm using these constants, let's say I've defined a <code>Token</code> class that has constants for all the characters that are part of the syntax of some artificial language. I also have a <code>Scanner</code> class that reads a stream of characters, generating a <code>Token</code> instance for each one.</p>

<pre><code>module Foo
  class Token
    LPAREN = ""(""
    RPAREN = "")""
    ...
  end

  class Scanner
    def next_token
      case read_char()
        when Token::LPAREN: # Generate a new LPAREN token
        ...
</code></pre>

<p>That is, when checking to see what kind of token should be generated for the given character, I want to use the constants defined in <code>Token</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2</strong>: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4532405/what-is-the-right-way-to-initialize-a-constant-in-ruby/4533168#4533168"">Jörg's answer</a> revealed that the problem was probably in how I was constructing paths in my <code>require</code> statements, not in how I was initializing or using the constants. I rewrote my <code>require</code> statements to eliminate any manual path creation, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code># File: $PROJECT_ROOT/lib/foo.rb; trying to load $PROJECT_ROOT/lib/foo/bar.rb
require File.expand_path(File.dirname(__FILE__)) + ""foo/bar""
</code></pre>

<p>is now written to rely on <code>$LOAD_PATH</code>:</p>

<pre><code># File: $PROJECT_ROOT/lib/foo.rb; trying to load $PROJECT_ROOT/lib/foo/bar.rb
require 'lib/foo/bar'
</code></pre>

<p>I removed the conditional checks from my constant initialization statements, and rake now runs unit tests without throwing any warnings.</p>
","2988","","<p>The only way this can happen, is when <code>bar.rb</code> is <code>require</code>d multiple times. Which shouldn't happen, since <code>require</code> doesn't load files that have already been loaded once.</p>

<p>It does, however, only use the path you pass to it to determine whether a file has already been loaded, at least in Ruby 1.8:</p>

<pre><code>require 'bar'   # =&gt; true, file was loaded

require 'bar'   # =&gt; false, file had already been loaded

require './bar' # =&gt; true, OOPS, I DID IT AGAIN
# bar.rb:3: warning: already initialized constant BAZ
</code></pre>

<p>So, you are right: this could very well be an indication that there is something wrong with your dependency management.</p>

<p>Typical warning signs are</p>

<ul>
<li><p>manually constructing file paths instead of just relying on <code>$LOAD_PATH</code></p>

<pre><code>require ""File.expand_path('../lib/bar', File.dirname(__FILE__))""
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>manipulating <code>$LOAD_PATH</code> anywhere except maybe the main entry point to your library:</p>

<pre><code>path = File.expand_path(File.dirname(__FILE__))
$LOAD_PATH &lt;&lt; path unless $LOAD_PATH.include?(path)
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>In general, my philosophy is that it's not my job as a library writer to figure out how to put my library on the <code>$LOAD_PATH</code>. It's the system administrator's job. If the sysadmin uses RubyGems to install my library, then RubyGems will take care of it, otherwise whatever other package management system he uses should take care of it, and if he uses <code>setup.rb</code>, then it will be installed in <code>site_ruby</code>, which is already on the <code>$LOAD_PATH</code> anyway.</p>

"<p>The TDD cycle is <em>test, code, refactor, (repeat) and then ship</em>. TDD implies development that is driven by testing, specifically that means understanding requirements and then writing tests first before developing or writing code.  </p>

<p>My natural inclination is a philosophical bias in favor of TDD; I would like to be convinced that there are other approaches that now work well or even better than TDD so I have asked this question. There are other questions that suggest TDD is expensive, tough to implement, presents challenges ... agreed, but what are good alternatives?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>What are good examples of <em>perfectly acceptable</em> approaches that do not use/need/require test driven development?</strong></p>

<p>I can think of plenty approaches that are not TDD but could be a lot more trouble than what they are worth ... it's not moral judgement, it's just that they are cost more than they are worth ... the following are simply examples of  things that might be ok as learning exercises, but approaches I'd find to be NOT acceptable in serious production and NOT TDD might include:  </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Inspecting quality into your product</strong> -- Focusing efforts on developing a proficiency in testing/QA can be problematic, especially if you don't work on the requirements and development side first ...  symptom of this include bug triaging where the developers have so many different bugs to deal with it, it is necessary to employ a form of triage -- each development cycle gets worse and worse, programmers work more and more hours, sleep less and less, struggle to keep going in death march until they are consumed. </li>
<li><strong>Superstition ... believing in things that you don't understand</strong> -- this would involve borrowing code that you <em>believe</em> has been proven or tested from somewhere, e.g. legacy code, a magic code starter wizard or an open source project, and you go forward hacking up a storm of modifications, sliding FaceBook Connect into your the user interface, inventing some new magic features on the fly (e.g. a mashup using the Twitter API, GoogleMaps API and maybe Zappos API), showing off your cool new ""product"" to a few people and then writing up a simple ""specification"" and list of ""test cases"" and turning that over to Mechanical Turk for testing. (Extra points are awarded for believing your product is then next Facebook, Twitter or YouTube.)  </li>

","2988","","<p><em>Cleanroom Software Engineering</em> is a methodology that sounds on the one hand extremely rigid, static, ""un-agile"" and pretty much the <em>opposite</em> of TDD, but on the other hand it is actually very similar. It is highly iterative for example, like all Agile methods. Like TDD, you write a specification first, but unlike TDD that specification takes the form of a mathematical proof of correctness rather than an executable test.</p>

<p>Where the TDD cycle is</p>

<ol>
<li>Specify</li>
<li>Code</li>
<li>Refactor</li>

</ol>

<p>I put the tests in parentheses because they are usually (semi-)automatically generated from the specification. So, while they are part of the development cycle, they are not part of the work the programmer has to do.</p>

<p>From what I've read, the performance metrics of Cleanroom are very similar to those of TDD, which leads me to believe that the <em>real</em> value of TDD isn't actually in the testing part, it is in the <em>thinking</em> part. It would be interesting to perform an experiment, where you replace the ""Red"" part of TDD with a simple stopwatch that locks your keyboard for 30 seconds before you can write a new method.</p>

","2988","","<p>The DevKit contains a development environment for the <a href=""http://RubyInstaller.Org/"" rel=""nofollow"">MinGW port of MRI and YARV</a>. You are using the MSVC6 port of MRI, so you need to install a development environment for MSVC6.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there is no ready-made DevKit-like package for that. You will have to install it on your own. Note that it's not actually <em>that</em> hard to install, the biggest problem is to get a hold of a copy of Microsoft Visual C 6.0, since that hasn't been on sale for about 10 years now. You'll basically have to find someone who is going to sell you a used copy.</p>

<p>May I ask why you need to use a port of Ruby that hasn't been maintained in over 2 years, contains a version of Ruby that is so old that it cannot even run most modern code (e.g. Rails requires at least 1.8.7 or 1.9.2) and has several bugs, including security holes? Why don't you just use the MinGW port which is actually maintained?</p>

"<p>Can somebody please explain (with example) the difference between context-independent and context-dependent overloading?</p>
","2988","","<p>I have never heard about those. And there's only about five hits on Google, one of which is this very question, which seems to suggest to me that these are made-up terms. And as with any made-up term, if you want to know what it means, you have to ask the person who made it up.</p>

<p>From what little I could gather, it seems to be related to return-type based overloading.</p>

<p>Basically, if you have four overloaded functions like these:</p>

<pre><code>foo :: string → int
foo :: string → string
foo :: string → ()
foo :: int → int
</code></pre>

<p>And you call them like this:</p>

<pre><code>1 + foo 1
1 + foo ""one""
foo ""one""
</code></pre>

<p>Then, with context-dependent overloading (i.e. overloading based on the return type as well as the parameter types), the following implementations will be selected:</p>

<pre><code>1 + foo 1     # foo :: int → int
1 + foo ""one"" # foo :: string → int (because `+` takes an `int`)
foo ""one""     # foo :: string → ()  (because there is no return value)
</code></pre>

<p>Whereas with context-independent overloading (i.e. ignoring the return type), the following implementations will be selected:</p>

<pre><code>1 + foo 1     # foo :: int → int
1 + foo ""one"" # ERROR
foo ""one""     # ERROR
</code></pre>

<p>In both the <code>ERROR</code> cases, there is an ambiguity between <code>foo :: string → int</code>, <code>foo :: string → string</code> and <code>foo :: string → ()</code>, since they only differ in their return type but have the same paremeter type.</p>

<pre><code>new ScriptEngineManager().getEngineByName(""javascript"");
</code></pre>

<p>I went to the rhino's download page, get the most recent version, and extracted the js.jar from it, added the jar on the project, but still have the same problem.</p>
","2988","","<p>The JavaScript Engine is only included in the Sun/Oracle JDK. If you use some other Java implementation like IBM J9 or Oracle JRockit (quite likely on a server), or if you don't use the Sun/Oracle JDK but the Sun/Oracle JRE (even more likely on a server), then you don't get the JavaScript engine.</p>

<p>You need to use Sun's full JDK.</p>

<p>Note also that the JavaScript engine shipped with JDK6 is <em>not</em> Rhino, it's a stripped-down lobotomized version of a several year old obsolote release of Rhino. In particular, it is missing the compiler, which means that performance will probably suck.</p>

<p>Also note that the API is not necessarily compatible between Rhino and the JDK6 JavaScript engine, <em>even if</em> you manage to find that obsolete release of Rhino that it is based on. So, if you want to use Rhino in deployment, you'd better use it in development, too.</p>

<p>And last but not least: just because you make some entry in your Eclipse project file, doesn't mean that your server's classpath is going to magically change. You need to make sure that all your classpaths are properly set up.

"<p>I would like to know if there is any elegant way to implement a loop for the following method. I can only come up with a regular while loop (Java programmer) as the following pseudo code:</p>

<pre><code>while x&lt;10       
  search = Google::Search::Web.new()
  search.query = ""china""
  search.start = x
end

","2988","","<p>Since it doesn't look like the value of <code>x</code> never actually changes, there are two possible ways to rewrite this. Either <code>x &gt;= 10</code> before the loop starts, then it will never be run, and it can simply be replaced with nothing. Otherwise, it's an infinite loop, and the most idiomatic way to write that is</p>

<pre><code>loop do
  search = Google::Search::Web.new
  search.query = 'china'
  search.start = x
end

<p>If you don't know the value of <code>x</code> beforehand, you can simply make the loop conditional:</p>

<pre><code>loop do
  search = Google::Search::Web.new
  search.query = 'china'
  search.start = x
end if x &lt; 10

<p>If <code>x</code> is a message send whose method changes its return value, then I don't see any obvious way to improve your code other than removing the superfluous braces.</p>

"<p>If I do</p>

<pre><code>def eval_file(file)
  instance_eval read(file)

<p>Then once something happens in one of the methods / blocks inside the file all I see is something like <code>(eval):20 in 'eval_file</code>'. When I use eval_file with many files it is hard to tell from which one the exception came (the exception happens after the eval, when using a method)</p>

<p>Is there some way for me to see the actual file and line number?</p>
","2988","","<p>As you can see from <a href=""http://RubyDoc.Info/stdlib/core/1.9.2/BasicObject%3ainstance_eval"">the documentation</a>, <code>BasicObject#instance_eval</code> (and in fact all the other <code>*_eval</code>s as well) will simply report whatever file name and line number you tell it to:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h1>Method: BasicObject#instance_eval</h1>
  
  <ul>
  <li>(<code>Object</code>) <code>instance_eval(string[, filename [, lineno]])</code></li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Evaluates a string containing Ruby source code, or the given block, within the context of the receiver (<em>obj</em>). In order to set the context, the variable <code>self</code> is set to <em>obj</em> while the code is executing, giving the code access to <em>obj</em>’s instance variables. In the version of <code>instance_eval</code> that takes a <code>String</code>, <strong>the optional second and third parameters supply a filename and starting line number that are used when reporting compilation errors</strong>.</p>
  
  <p>[&hellip;]</p>
  
  <h2>Overloads:</h2>
  
  <ul>
  <li>(<code>Object</code>) <code>instance_eval(string[, filename [, lineno]])</code></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>[Emphasis mine.]</p>

<p>In general, if you use the <code>String</code> overload of the <code>*_eval</code> methods, you should make sure that you get <a href=""http://OlaBini.Com/blog/2008/01/ruby-antipattern-using-eval-without-positioning-information/"">sensible location information by passing file name and line number</a> [<a href=""http://Ola-Bini.BlogSpot.Com/2008/01/ruby-antipattern-using-eval-without.html"">alternative link</a>].</p>

<p>In your particular case, you would omit the line number, since you want Ruby to simply use the line number(s) of the file, but you need to pass the file name:</p>

","2988","","<p>It's very difficult to figure out what exactly it is that you are trying to do. As @ehabkost already pointed out, if an exception is raised, the execution is aborted anyway, so there's nothing you need to do. Anything which comes after the code that raised the exception won't be executed anyway, after all that is the <em>whole point</em> of exceptions.</p>

<p>Does this do what you want?</p>

<p>By the way: you should <em>never</em>, under no circumstances, just blindly rescue <em>all</em> exceptions. You should only ever rescue <em>exactly</em> the ones you expect. Do you <em>really</em> think it is a good idea to just blindly swallow, say, a <code>ThreadError</code> without ever noticing it? There are 39 direct subclasses of <code>ActiveRecordError</code> alone, perhaps one of those is more appropriate than just rescuing all exceptions (or at least all <code>StandardError</code> exceptions).</p>

"<p>It's common knowledge in most programming languages that the flow for working with files is open-use-close.

""claimed by the garbage collector."" means that the GC acts at some point in the future. and it's expensive. a lot of reasons for explicitly closing files.</p>

","2988","","<blockquote>
  <p>I saw many times in ruby codes unmatched <code>File.open</code> calls</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Can you give an example? I only ever see that in code written by newbies who <em>lack</em> the ""common knowledge in most programming languages that the flow for working with files is open-use-close"".</p>

<p>Experienced Rubyists either explicitly close their files, or, more idiomatically, use the block form of <a href=""http://RubyDoc.Info/stdlib/core/1.9.2/File.open""><code>File.open</code></a>, which automatically closes the file for you. Its implementation basically looks something like like this:</p>

<pre><code>def File.open(*args, &amp;block)
  return open_with_block(*args, &amp;block) if block_given?
  open_without_block(*args)
end

def File.open_without_block(*args)
  # do whatever ...
end

def File.open_with_block(*args)
  yield f = open_without_block(*args)
rescue
ensure
  f.close
  raise
end
</code></pre>

<p>Scripts are a special case. Scripts generally run so short, and use so few file descriptors that it simply doesn't make sense to close them, since the operating system will close them anyway when the script exits.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do we need to explicitly close?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If yes then why does the GC autoclose?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because after it has collected the object, there is no way for you to close the file anymore, and thus you would leak file descriptors.</p>

<p>Note that it's not the garbage collector that closes the files. The garbage collector simply executes any finalizers for an object before it collects it. It just so happens that the <code>File</code> class defines a finalizer which closes the file.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If not then why the option?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because wasted memory is cheap, but wasted file descriptors aren't. Therefore, it doesn't make sense to tie the lifetime of a file descriptor to the lifetime of some chunk of memory.</p>

<p>You simply cannot predict <em>when</em> the garbage collector will run. You cannot even predict <em>if</em> it will run <em>at all</em>: if you never run out of memory, the garbage collector will never run, therefore the finalizer will never run, therefore the file will never be closed.</p>

"<p>I had a good look around but I couldn't find the <strong>convention</strong> on how to use quotes for strings, I know the difference between the two, but everywhere I see good code with double quotes where the singles are enough, therefor I can't recognize any pattern.

I rather use the single quotes as much as possible (also to enstrong my confidence with the difference between the two).</p>

","2988","","<p>I don't think there is a strong convention within the entire community.

<p>Personally, whenever I have several different ways to express the same thing, I tend to use those different ways to convey different semantics.

<p>The important bit here is to explicitly specify the encoding of the file, using the <code>:encoding</code> key in the <code>options</code> <code>Hash</code> of the <code>File.new</code> method (or in this case, <code>File.open</code>).

<p>I also took the liberty of changing your code to a more idiomatic Ruby style:</p>

<li>There's really no need to use <code>Array#pack</code> here, just write down what you want.</li>
<li>Whenever possible, use the block form of <code>File.open</code>, which will take care of closing the file for you, even in the case of an error or exception.</li>
<li>When dealing with text files, you should always pass the <code>t</code> modifier. It doesn't make any difference on most operating systems (which is why, unfortunately, most Rubyists forget to pass it), but it is <em>crucial</em> on Windows, which is what you appear to be using.</li>

<p>If you own the book, it's in Chapter 3's, ""Classes, Objects, and Variables,"" specifically in the section about virtual attributes.</p>

<p>Basically, a class is defined with an initializer that sets a couple of instance variables, one of which is <code>@price</code>. That variable has an accessor / mutator created with attr_accessor like so:</p>

<pre><code>attr_accessor :price
</code></pre>

<p>That class also has a virtual attribute called, <code>price_in_cents</code> which simply returns the value from this line:</p>

<pre><code>Integer(price*100 + 0.5)
</code></pre>

<p>Now my question is why is <code>price</code> in the virtual attribute not prefixed with an <code>@</code>? It is clearly dealing with an instance variable. Executing the code without the <code>@</code> works just the same as with; why is that?</p>

<p>P.S. Sorry for not just posting the code wholesale—given that this is a question about code in a book, I wasn't sure what legal right I'd have to post.</p>
","2988","","<p>That's a receiverless message send.</p>

<p>In Ruby, the receiver <code>self</code> is implicit: you can leave it out if you want to. So, <code>price</code> is basically the same as <code>self.price</code> (ignoring access restrictions).</p>

<p>In other words, it's calling the method <code>price</code> you defined with <code>attr_accessor</code>.</p>

<p>But where is <code>meth2</code> defined? Well, it's obviously <em>not</em> defined as a nested method, since there <em>are no</em> nested methods in Ruby. It's defined as an instance method of <code>Test1</code>:</p>

<pre><code>Test1.new.meth2
# Yay
</code></pre>

<p>Also, it will obviously be redefined every time you run <code>meth1</code>:</p>

<pre><code>Test1.new.meth1
# Yay

Test1.new.meth1.

# test1.rb:3: warning: previous definition of meth2 was here

<p>In short: no, Ruby <em>does not</em> support nested methods.</p>

<p>Note also that in Ruby, method bodies cannot be closures, only block bodies can. This pretty much eliminates the major use case for nested methods, since even <em>if</em> Ruby supported nested methods, you couldn't use the outer method's variables in the nested method.</p>

<p>I'm doing rapid analysis of lots of data (many TB) and I am going to have a lot of instances of a lot of objects.  For some of these objects, it doesn't make sense to have two different instances with the same data.  For example, one such object is a ""window"" (as in temporal window) object that has two properties:  start time and end time.  I want to be able to use the constructor in any of these ways and get a window object back:</p>

<pre><code>window = Window.new(time_a, time_b)
window = Window.new([time_a, time_b])
window = Window.new(seconds_since_epoch_a, seconds_since_epoch_b)
window = Window.new(window_obj)
window = Window.new(end =&gt; time_b, start =&gt; time_a)
...

<p>Some other object that needs a window might be instantiated this way:</p>

<pre><code>obj = SomeObj.new(data =&gt; my_data, window =&gt; window_arg)
</code></pre>

<p>I don't necessarily know what's in window_arg, and I don't really care -- it will accept any single argument that can be interpreted by the Window constructor.  In the case of already having a Window instance, I'd rather just use that instance.  But the job of interpreting that seems like a concern of the Window constructor.  Anyway, as I mentioned I'm churning through many TB of data and creating lots of instances of things.  If a window object gets passed around, I want it just to be recognized as a window object and used.</p>

","2988","","<p>Ruby doesn't have nested classes.</p>

<p>The only way to inherit behavior is, well, via inheritance.</p>

<p>If you want your code to work, you need to use a language which supports nested classes. While this is an <em>incredibly</em> neat and powerful feature, I unfortunately know of only two languages that have nested classes:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://daimi.au.dk/~beta/"">BETA</a>, the language which introduced nested classes (and its successor <a href=""http://daimi.au.dk/~eernst/gbeta/"">gbeta</a>)</li>
<li><a href=""http://NewspeakLanguage.Org/"">Newspeak</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I don't know of any other.</p>

<p>Java has a construct called nested classes, but they have some unfortunate design limitations.</p>

<p>In your example above, it's not the <em>class <code>B</code></em> that is nested inside <code>A</code>, it is the <em>constant</em> <code>B</code> that is nested inside <code>A</code>. Think about this:</p>

<pre><code>C = A::B
</code></pre>

<p>Now, the class is available under <em>two</em> names: <code>A::B</code> and <code>C</code>. It should be immediately obvious that <code>C</code> is global and not nested inside <code>A</code>. (Well, actually, <code>C</code> is nested inside <code>Object</code>, because there aren't really global constants either, but that's beside the point.) But since <code>C</code> and <code>A::B</code> are the same class, it obviously cannot be both nested and not nested. The only logical conclusion is that the <em>class itself</em> isn't nested.</p>

<p>The defining feature of nested classes is that method lookup goes along two dimensions: up the inheritance chain, and outwards through the nesting. Ruby, like 99.9% of all OO languages, only supports the former. (In some sense, nested classes inherit not only the features of their superclass, but also the features of their surrounding class.)</p>

</code></pre>

<p>So the first test fails, whereas the second test passes. Why is that?</p>
","2988","","<p>The second test passes, because it doesn't test anything. It doesn't contain any expectation (i.e. a call to <code>should</code> or <code>should_not</code>). It <em>cannot</em> fail, because there is nothing <em>to</em> fail.</p>

<p>The first test fails, because you are asserting that an instance of <code>RspecTest</code> is equal to the string <code>'foo'</code>. This cannot possibly be true. How could those two objects possibly be equal if they aren't even the same <em>kind</em> of object?</p>

<p>Judging by the description of the test, you didn't actually mean to test whether the instance of <code>RspecTest</code> is equal to the string <code>'foo'</code>, but rather whether the return value of the instance method <code>to_s</code> is equal to the string <code>'foo'</code>. However, you never call <code>to_s</code> anywhere.</p>

<p>Let's first fix the two obvious problems. Now, we have a test like this:</p>

<pre><code>it 'should return foo (to_s)' do
  RspecTest.new.to_s.should == 'foo'
end

it 'should return foo (inspect)' do
  RspecTest.new.inspect.should == 'foo'
end
</code></pre>

<p>There is some unnecessary duplication there with the two <code>RspecTest.new</code> calls, so let's fix that by simply making <code>RspecTest.new</code> the default subject:</p>

<pre><code>  subject { RspecTest.new }

  it 'should return foo (to_s)' do
    subject.to_s.should == 'foo'
  end

  it 'should return foo (inspect)' do
    subject.inspect.should == 'foo'
  end
</code></pre>

<p>And actually, if you don't supply an explicit subject, then RSpec will walk up the chain of nested <code>describe</code> blocks until it finds a class, and will simply call that class's <code>new</code> method to provide the subject. So, we can just delete the <code>subject</code> declaration:</p>

<pre><code>  it 'should return foo (to_s)' do
    subject.to_s.should == 'foo'
  end

  it 'should return foo (inspect)' do
    subject.inspect.should == 'foo'
  end
</code></pre>

<p>Personally, I prefer to let RSpec provide the example name by itself, so that the example name and the actual example code don't get out of sync, so I'd probably write that more like this:</p>

<pre><code>describe RspecTest do
  describe '#to_s' do
    it { subject.to_s.should == 'foo' }
  end

  describe '#inspect' do
    it { subject.inspect.should == ""foo"" }
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Which yields:</p>

<pre><code>RspecTest
  #to_s
    should == ""foo""
  #inspect
    should == ""foo""

Finished in 0.16023 seconds
2 examples, 0 failures
</code></pre>

<p>Last but not least, your initializer isn't actually doing anything, so you don't need it. All together, my version looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>class RspecTest
  def to_s; 'foo' end
end

describe RspecTest do
  describe '#to_s' do
    it { subject.to_s.should == 'foo' }
  end

  describe '#inspect' do
    it { subject.inspect.should == ""foo"" }

"<p>I'm new to Haskell and Parsec. After reading <a href=""http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/using-parsec.html"">Chapter 16 Using Parsec of Real World Haskell</a>, a question appeared in my mind: Why and when is Parsec better than other parser generators like Yacc/Bison/Antlr?</p>

<p>My understanding is that Parsec creates a nice DSL of writing parsers and Haskell makes it very easy and expressive. But parsing is such a standard/popular technology that deserves its own language, which outputs to multiple target languages. So when shall we use Parsec instead of, say, generating Haskell code from Bison/Antlr?</p>

<p>This question might go a little beyond technology, and into the realm of industry practice. When writing a parser from scratch, what's the benefit of picking up Haskell/Parsec compared to Bison/Antlr or something similar?</p>

<p>BTW: my question is quite similar to <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1364259/antlr-vs-happy-vs-other-parser-generators"">this one</a> but wasn't answered satisfactorily there.</p>
","2988","","<p>One of the main differences between the tools you listed, is that ANTLR, Bison and their friends are parser <em>generators</em>, whereas Parsec is a parser <em>combinator</em> library.</p>

<p>A parser generator reads in a description of a grammar and spits out a parser. It is generally not possible to <em>combine</em> existing grammars into a new grammar, and it is certainly not possible to combine two existing generated parsers into a new parser.</p>

<p>A parser combinator OTOH does nothing <em>but</em> combine existing parsers into new parsers. Usually, a parser combinator library ships with a couple of trivial built-in parsers that can parse the empty string or a single character, and it ships with a set of combinators that take 1 or more parsers and return a new one that, for example, parses the sequence of the original parsers (e.g. you can combine a <code>d</code> parser and an <code>o</code> parser to form a <code>do</code> parser), the alternation of the original parsers (e.g. a <code>0</code> parser and a <code>1</code> parser to a <code>0|1</code> parser) or parses the original parse multiple times (repetetion).</p>

<p>What this means is that you could, for example, take an existing parser for Java and an existing parser for HTML and combine them into a parser for JSP.</p>

<p>Most parser generators don't support this, or only support it in a limited way. Parser <em>combinators</em> OTOH <em>only</em> support this and nothing else.</p>

"<p>Currently I'm reading ""The Well-Grounded Rubyist"" by David A. Black, and I stuck at 10.9 chapter (Enumerators and the next dimension of enumerability). My question is about <code>yield</code> method.
What is the meaning of the word <code>yield</code> in Ruby context? My native language is Russian, and Google Translate shows me a bunch of translation variants, that are confusing me. There are some of them: <em>give</em>, <em>bring</em>, <em>surrender</em> (<em>give up</em>), <em>produce</em>, <em>agree</em>, <em>comply</em> and many others.</p>

<p><strong>UPD:</strong> please, pay attention to the fact, that I'm trying to understand the meaning of the  <a href=""http://rubydoc.info/stdlib/core/1.9.2/Enumerator/Yielder#yield-instance_method"" rel=""nofollow"">Enumerator::Yielder#yield</a> method, but not <code>yield</code> keyword itself.</p>

<p><strong>UPD_2:</strong> I've found interesting article about Enumerators: ""<a href=""http://www.michaelharrison.ws/weblog/?p=163"" rel=""nofollow"">Lazy Enumerators in Ruby</a>"".</p>
","2988","","<p>The word <em>yield</em> doesn't really have any special meaning in the context of Ruby. It means the same thing as it means in every other programming language, or in programming and computer science in general.</p>

<p>It is usually used when some kind of execution context <em>surrenders</em> control flow to a different execution context. For example, in Unix, there is a <code>sched_yield</code> function which a thread can use to give up the CPU to another thread (or process). With coroutines, the term <code>yield</code> is generally used to transfer control from one coroutine to another. In C#, there is a <code>yield</code> keyword, which is used by an iterator method to give up control to the <em>iterating</em> method.</p>

<p>And in fact, this last usage is exactly identical to the usage of the <a href=""http://RubyDoc.Info/stdlib/core/1.9.2/Enumerator/Yielder#yield-instance_method""><code>Enumerator::Yielder#yield</code></a> method in Ruby, which you were asking about. Calling this method will suspend the enumerator and give up control to the enumerating method.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>fibs = Enumerator.new do |y|
  a, b = 0, 1
  y.yield a
  loop do
    y.yield b
    a, b = b, a + b
  end
end

puts fibs.next #  0
puts fibs.next #  1
puts fibs.next #  1
puts fibs.next #  2
puts fibs.next #  3
puts fibs.next #  5
puts fibs.next #  8
puts fibs.next # 13
puts fibs.next # 21
</code></pre>

<p>As you see, there is an infinite loop. Obviously, if this loop just ran on its own, it wouldn't be of much use. But since every time it hits the <code>yield</code> method, it gives up control until it is called again, this will produce the Fibonacci numbers one by one, essentially representing an infinitely long list of all Fibonacci numbers.</p>

<p>There is another method, <a href=""http://RubyDoc.Info/stdlib/core/1.9.2/Fiber#yield-class_method""><code>Fiber.yield</code></a>, which serves a similar purpose. (In fact, I already described it above, because <code>Fiber</code> is just Ruby's name for coroutines.) Inside a <code>Fiber</code>, you call <code>Fiber.yield</code> to give up control back to the execution context that originally gave control to you.</p>

<p>Lastly, there is the <code>yield</code> keyword, which is used inside a method body to give up control to the block that was passed into the method.</p>

<p>Note that, at least in the <code>Enumerator</code> case (i.e. the first example), you can additionally interpret <code>yield</code> as <em>to produce</em>, since the <code>Enumerator</code> produces a new value, every time it calls <code>yield</code>.</p>

","2988","","<p>As a general hint for solving such error messages: in 99% of all cases, when a computer tells you it cannot find something, it is because that thing doesn't exist. In 99% of the rest of the cases, that thing isn't where the computer expects it to be.</p>

<p>The first one is obviously not the case here, since <code>bowling.rb</code> clearly <em>does</em> exist. However, your problem squarely falls into those second 99%: <code>require</code> loads a file file from Ruby's <code>$LOAD_PATH</code>. But you didn't put <code>bowling.rb</code> into a directory on Ruby's <code>$LOAD_PATH</code>, you simply put it in the same directory as <code>bowling_spec.rb</code>.</p>

<p>One obvious solution would be to add that directory to Ruby's <code>$LOAD_PATH</code>. Obvious, but&nbsp;&ndash; in this case&nbsp;&ndash; wrong.</p>

<p>If you want to load a file relative to the position of the currently executing file, you need to use <code>require_relative</code>. This is the <em>right</em> solution in this case.</p>

<p>Note that, in order for the <code>describe</code> method to even <em>exist</em>, let alone work, you would also need to either add <code>require 'rspec'</code> to your spec file, or run it using the RSpec runner (i.e. <code>rspec bowling_spec.rb</code> instead of <code>ruby bowling_spec.rb</code>), but this is completely unrelated to the problem you are seeing.</p>

","2988","","<p>This is easy to do with Git with a <code>pre-receive</code> hook. Of course, this requires that you are actually <em>able</em> to install hooks, and for obvious reasons, GitHub doesn't allow you to upload arbitrary executable files to run on their servers :-)</p>

<p>In general, the workflow with Git or really any distributed version control system, is that you don't allow other people to push to your repository. Instead, you pull from theirs. This requires a much lower level of trust. So, this would be workaround number 1: don't let them push, have them fork and then pull from them. That way, you can control what goes into your repository.</p>

<p>Another workaround would be to set up your own staging repository on a server you own, where you can install your own Git hooks. You can configure a <code>pre-receive</code> hook which denies pushing if it's not a fast-forward and <code>post-receive</code> hook which automatically forwards all pushes to GitHub. Of course, this means that you lose many of the benefits of using GitHub in the first place.</p>

<p>As a third workaround, you could use multiple repositories. This is a combination of the two other approaches: have one repository that your collaborators can push to and another one that only you have access to, that you pull into from the first repository.</p>

  <p>What blocks Ruby, Python to get Javascript V8 speed?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nothing.</p>

<p>Well, okay: money. (And time, people, resources, but if you have money, you can buy those.)</p>

<p>V8 has a team of brilliant, highly-specialized, highly-experienced (and thus highly-paid) engineers working on it, that have decades of experience (I'm talking individually&nbsp;&ndash; collectively it's more like centuries) in creating high-performance execution engines for dynamic OO languages. They are basically the same people who also created the Sun HotSpot JVM (among many others).</p>

<p>Lars Bak, the lead developer, has been literally working on VMs for 25 years (and all of those VMs have lead up to V8), which is basically his entire (professional) life. Some of the people writing Ruby VMs aren't even 25 years old.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are there any Ruby / Python features that are blocking implementation of optimizations (e.g. inline caching) V8 engine has?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Given that at least IronRuby, JRuby, MagLev, MacRuby and Rubinius have either monomorphic (IronRuby) or polymorphic inline caching, the answer is obviously no.</p>

<p>Modern Ruby implementations already do a great deal of optimizations. For example, for certain operations, Rubinius's <code>Hash</code> class is faster than YARV's. Now, this doesn't sound terribly exciting until you realize that Rubinius's <code>Hash</code> class is implemented in 100% pure Ruby, while YARV's is implemented in 100% hand-optimized C.</p>

<p>So, at least in some cases, Rubinius can generate better code than GCC!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Or this is rather matter of resources put into the V8 project by Google.</p>

<p>Yes. Not just Google. The lineage of V8's source code is 25 years old now. The people who are working on V8 also created the Self VM (to this day one of the fastest dynamic OO language execution engines ever created), the Animorphic Smalltalk VM (to this day one of the fastest Smalltalk execution engines ever created), the HotSpot JVM (the fastest JVM ever created, probably the fastest VM period) and OOVM (one of the most efficient Smalltalk VMs ever created).</p>

<p>In fact, Lars Bak, the lead developer of V8, worked on <em>every single one</em> of those, plus a few others.</p>

<p>I vaguely remember that at or around the same time, someone else was also playing around with a database in Ruby. I think it was either inspired by or a reaction to RDDB.</p>

<p>Last but not least, there is the <a href=""http://RubyDoc.Info/stdlib/pstore/frames/"" rel=""nofollow"">PStore library</a> in the stdlib, which&nbsp;&ndash; depending on your definition&nbsp;&ndash; may or may not count as a database.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And if not, would it be unwise to create one in Ruby?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The biggest problem I see in Ruby are its concurrency primitives. Threads and locks are <em>so</em> 1960s. If you want to support multiple concurrent users, then you obviously need concurrency, although if you want to build an embedded in-process database, then this is much less of a concern.</p>

<p>Other than that, there are some not-so-stellar implementations of Ruby, but that is not a limitation of Ruby but of those particular implementations, and it applies to pretty much every other programming language as well. Rubinius (especially the current development trunk, which adds Ruby 1.9 compatibility and removes the Global Interpreter Lock) and JRuby would both be fine choices.</p>

<p>As an added bonus, Rubinius comes with a built-in actors library for concurrency and JRuby gives you access to e.g. Clojure's concurrency libraries or the Akka actors library.</p>

<p>Performance isn't really much of a concern, I think. Rubinius's <code>Hash</code> class, which is written in 100% pure Ruby, performs comparably to YARV's <code>Hash</code> class, which is written in 100% hand-optimized C. This shows you that Ruby code, at least when it is carefully written, can be just as fast as C, especially since databases tend to be long-running and thus Rubinius's or JRuby's (and in the latter case specifically also the JVM's) dynamic optimizers (which C compilers typically do <em>not</em> have) can <em>really</em> get to work.</p>

","2988","","<p><code>Hash#each</code>, just like every other <code>#each</code> method, yields <em>one</em> argument to the block. In the case of <code>Hash#each</code>, that one argument is a two-element array consisting of the key and the value.</p>

<p>So, <code>Hash#each</code> yields <em>one</em> argument, but your lambda has <em>two</em> mandatory parameters, therefore you get an arity error.</p>

<p>It works with blocks, since blocks are less strict about their arguments, and in particular, if a block has multiple parameters, but only gets one argument, it will try to deconstruct the argument as if it had been passed in with a splat.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of <code>Proc</code>s: lambdas and non-lambdas (confusingly, the latter are usually also called <code>Proc</code>s). Lambdas behave like methods in terms of how the <code>return</code> keyword behaves and (more importantly, for this case) how they bind arguments, whereas non-lambda <code>Proc</code>s behave like blocks in terms of how <code>return</code> and argument binding work. That's why <code>Proc.new</code> (which creates a non-lambda <code>Proc</code>) works, but <code>lambda</code> (which obviously creates a lambda) doesn't.</p>

<p>You can check whether a <code>Proc</code> is a lambda or not by calling <code>Proc#lambda?</code>.</p>

<p>If you want to deconstruct the argument, you will have to do so explicitly, the same way you would when you define a method:</p>

","2988","","<p>First off, as @pst pointed out, your example can be entirely implemented using static typing, it doesn't require dynamic typing.</p>

<p>Secondly, if you want to program in a dynamically typed language, program in a dynamically typed language.</p>

<p>That being said, you <em>can</em> actually do something like that in Scala. Here is a simplistic example:</p>

<pre><code>class Dict[V](args: (String, V)*) extends Dynamic {
  import scala.collection.mutable.Map

  private val backingStore = Map[String, V](args:_*)

  def typed[T] = throw new UnsupportedOperationException()

  def applyDynamic(name: String)(args: Any*) = {
    val k = if (name.endsWith(""_="")) name.dropRight(2) else name
    if (name.endsWith(""_="")) backingStore(k) = args.first.asInstanceOf[V]
    backingStore.get(k)
  }

  override def toString() = ""Dict("" + backingStore.mkString("", "") + "")""
}

object Dict {
  def apply[V](args: (String, V)*) = new Dict(args:_*)
}

val t1 = Dict[Any]()
t1.bar_=(""quux"")

val t2 = new Dict(""foo"" -&gt; ""bar"", ""baz"" -&gt; ""quux"")
val t3 = Dict(""foo"" -&gt; ""bar"", ""baz"" -&gt; ""quux"")

t1.bar // =&gt; Some(quux)
t2.baz // =&gt; Some(quux)
t3.baz // =&gt; Some(quux)
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, you were pretty close, actually. Your main mistake was that <code>Dynamic</code> is a trait, not a class, so you can't instantiate it, you have to mix it in. And you obviously have to actually define what you want it to do, i.e. implement <code>typed</code> and <code>applyDynamic</code>.</p>

<p>If you want <em>your</em> example to work, there are a couple of complications. In particular, you need something like a type-safe heterogenous map as a backing store. Also, there are some syntactic considerations. For example, <code>foo.bar = baz</code> is only translated into <code>foo.bar_=(baz)</code> if <code>foo.bar_=</code> exists, which it doesn't, because <code>foo</code> is a <code>Dynamic</code> object.</p>

<p>If, however, for some reason, you <em>need</em> RubyGems, then you should move your entire Ruby environment out of the distribution package manager and manage it yourself. Just install whatever version and flavor of Rubinius, JRuby, IronRuby, YARV or whatever you want, install the latest version of RubyGems from source (or don't, since all of the above already ship with one pre-installed anyway) and install all of your Ruby libraries as Gems.</p>

"<p>If one were to implement Ruby on top of a Javascript engine (either in the browser or on top of standalone V8 or Spidermonkey), what would be the key impedance mismatches between the Ruby and JS object models ?</p>
","2988","","<p>The most in-your-face one is obviously the fact that ECMAScript is prototype-based and Ruby is class-plus-mixin-based. Also, in Ruby, encapsulation is done with objects, in ECMAScript with closures.</p>

<p>However, my guess is that Ruby's control flow constructs are going to be a much bigger hurdle than its object model. After all, <a href=""http://JSClass.JCoglan.Com/"">James Coglan's JS.Class</a> <em>is</em> basically an implementation of Ruby's object model in ECMAScript and it's not that big.</p>

<p>ECMAScript simply lacks the tools needed to build your own control-flow constructs on top of it. Typically, you need either <code>GOTO</code>, continuations or proper tail calls. If you have one of those, you can easily implement everything else: exceptions, loops, switches, threads, <code>Fiber</code>s, generators, coroutines, &hellip; you name it.</p>

<p>But ECMAScript doesn't have them (and for good reason, at least in the case of <code>GOTO</code>). The only control-flow construct ECMAScript has that is powerful enough to be able to build other constructs on top of is exceptions. Unfortunately, those are pretty slow. (Nonetheless, they <em>have</em> been used as an implementation substrate, for example in the Microsoft Live Labs Volta compiler, which used ECMAScript exceptions to implement .NET exceptions, iterators, generators and even threads.)</p>

<p>So, basically you are stuck with implementing at least your own call stack if not an entire interpreter (as is the case with HotRuby), performing global CPS transforms or something like that.</p>

<p>Basically, what you <em>want</em> from a Ruby engine running on top of ECMAScript, is</p>

<ol>

<li>performance and </li>
<li>tight integration with ECMAScript (i.e. the ability to pass objects and call methods back and forth between the two languages).</li>

"<p>When I decided to learn Ruby a short while ago I also decided that I'd start using unit tests and the TDD methodology. I started out using Test::Unit and wrote a couple of very small classes to get a feel for unit testing in general and Ruby and Test::Unit in particular.</p>

<p>So far everything has been quite easy but then I wanted to do something similar to nUnit's TestCase as I had 20 tests where the only thing that changed was the input and output.</p>

<p>The code looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>def test_2_inserted_return_true
    actual = @prime_generator.is_prime?(2)
    assert_equal(true, actual)
  end

  def test_3_inserted_return_true
      actual = @prime_generator.is_prime?(3)
      assert_equal(true, actual)
    end

  def test_5_inserted_return_true
    actual = @prime_generator.is_prime?(5)
    assert_equal(true, actual)
  end
</code></pre>

<p>Which is quite horrible from a DRY-perspective. What I would want is something similar to nUnit's TestCase.</p>

<p>Something like this:</p>

<pre><code>[TestCase(2.5d, 2d, Result=1.25d)]
[TestCase(-2.5d, 1d, Result = -2.5d)]
public double ValidateDivision(double numerator, double denominator)
{
    var myClass = new MyClass();
    return myClass.Divide(numerator,denominator);
}
</code></pre>

<p>I've tried googling but could not find anything about Test::Unit. I've found some on RSpec and Selenium but that doesn't really help me. I also tried searching here but couldn't find anything either.</p>

<p>I thought about making the test method take parameters but defining methods again like that... Not happy about it. Besides, if I remember correctly it wasn't even possible (I am not able to test now or I would).</p>

<p>So, my question is: Is it possible to do data driven testing with Test::Unit in Ruby (1.9.2)? If not then what frameworks can do it?</p>
","2988","","<p>Let's not forget about good ol' loops:</p>

<pre><code>def test_that_the_first_few_primes_are_detected_as_prime
  [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17].each do |p|
    assert @primality_tester.prime?(p)
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Some people would use metaprogramming to define separate test methods, but in this case I think it's overkill:</p>

<pre><code>[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17].each do |p|
  define_method :""test_that_#{p}_is_detected_as_prime"" do
    assert @primality_tester.prime?(p)
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Generally, I don't think tests should be DRY. They should be DAMP (descriptive and meaningful phrases). After all, tests are your specification and your documentation, and they are read by people who may not be familiar with Ruby or even programming in general. So, I'm not even sure that your original example is bad, especially if you clean it up a bit like I did above:</p>

<pre><code>def test_that_2_is_detected_as_prime
  assert @primality_tester.prime?(2)
end

def test_that_3_is_detected_as_prime
  assert @primality_tester.prime?(3)
end

def test_that_5_is_detected_as_prime
  assert @primality_tester.prime?(5)
end
</code></pre>

<p>Here's what I did:</p>

<ul>
<li>Rename the tests: Now, the test name forms a complete sentence, and it doesn't simply restate what the test does.</li>
<li>Use <code>assert</code> instead of <code>assert_equal</code>: Checking for equality to <code>true</code> is almost never a good idea anyway, and <code>assert</code> <em>already</em> checks that the result is truthy, so why bother?</li>
<li>Rename <code>@prime_generator</code> to <code>@primality_tester</code>, since, well, it doesn't <em>generate primes</em>, it only checks whether a number is prime.</li>
<li>Rename <code>is_prime?</code> to just <code>prime?</code>, since the question is already implied by the question mark</li>
<li>Last, but certainly not least: Fix the formatting, since not only was the formatting inconsistent with standard Ruby coding conventions, it wasn't even consistent within <em>itself</em></li>
</ul>

<p>However, the <em>best</em> solution IMO would be something like this:</p>

<pre><code>def test_that_the_first_few_primes_are_detected_as_prime
  assert @primality_tester.prime?(2)
  assert @primality_tester.prime?(3)
  assert @primality_tester.prime?(5)
end
</code></pre>

<p>There's duplication in there, but it is duplication that is necessary to keep the test readable and pronouncable. DRY is a good principle for production code, which evolves and is extended, but for tests, DRY always needs to be balanced against DAMP. (Maybe it would make sense to write a custom assertion, but I doubt it. At least I can't come up with a good name for one, which is always a hint.)</p>

<p>A completely <em>different</em> approach would be property-based checking similar to Haskell's QuickCheck or .NET's Pex. There's a Ruby port of QuickCheck called <a href=""http://RushCheck.RubyForge.Org/"" rel=""nofollow"">RushCheck</a>, but it has been unmaintained since 2006 and maintenance has only picked up a couple of weeks ago with still a lot of work left to do to get it up to speed on recent versions of Ruby.</p>

"<p>Can someone explain to me with simple words what those two operators do:</p>

<pre><code>$

","2988","","<p><code>\</code> is not an operator, it is part of the literal syntax. More precisely, it is part of <em>two</em> literal syntaxes: it denotes a lambda literal and it serves as an escape character in string literals.</p>

<p>The operator <code>$</code> is defined in the prelude as</p>

<pre><code>($) :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; a -&gt; b
f $ x = f x
</code></pre>

<p>In other words, it does <em>exactly</em> the same thing as whitespace does, namely just plain function application. <em>However</em>, while function application is left-associative and has high precedence (the highest, in fact), <code>$</code> is right-associative and has low precedence.</p>

<p>This allows you to omit parentheses when you have chains like ""<code>f</code> applied to <code>g</code> applied to <code>h</code> applied to <code>x</code>"", which without the <code>$</code> operator would be written like</p>

<pre><code>f (g (h x))
</code></pre>

<p>but with the operator can be written as</p>

<pre><code>f $ g $ h x
</code></pre>

<p>It is also useful if you want to pass the function application operator itself as an argument to another function. Say, you have list of functions and a list of values and you want to apply every function in the list to the corresponding value in the other list:</p>

<pre><code>zipWith ($) fs xs

"<p>Coming from Python, I like many of the features that Coffeescript borrows from Python and Perl (ranges/slices, comprehensions, destructuring assignments). Is there any syntactic sugar in Coffeescript to mimic Python's <code>enumerate</code> or <code>zip</code> (<code>itertools.izip</code>) functions?</p>

<p>Here are the patterns that I don't care much for:</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there is no <code>Array.prototype.zip</code> or <code>Array.prototype.zipWith</code>. That seems to be a pretty big omission, especially considering that there is both <code>reduce</code> and <code>reduceRight</code>, the latter of which many other languages don't have.

<li><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/98268/whats-the-difference-between-a-script-and-an-application"">What’s the difference between a “script” and an “application”?</a></li>
</ul>
","2988","","<p>There's a lot of possible answers to this.</p>

<p>First: it's not really a question of the <em>difference</em> between a scripting language and a programming language, because a scripting language <em>is</em> a programming language. It's more a question of what traits make some programming language a scripting language while another programming language <em>isn't</em> a scripting language.</p>

<p>Second: it's really hard to say what a XYZ language is, whether that XYZ be ""scripting"", ""functional programming"", ""object-oriented programming"" or what have you. The definition of what ""functional programming"" is, is pretty clear, but nobody knows what a ""functional programming language"" is.</p>

<p>Functional programming or object-oriented programming are programming <em>styles</em>; you can write in a functional style or an object-oriented style in pretty much any language. For example, the Linux Virtual File System Switch and the Linux Driver Model are heavily object-oriented despite written in C, whereas a lot of Java or C# code you see on the web is very procedural and not object-oriented <em>at all</em>. OTOH, I have seen some heavily functional Java code.</p>

<p>So, if functional programming and object-oriented programming are merely styles that can be done in <em>any</em> language, then how do you define an ""object-oriented programming language""? You could say that an object-oriented programming language is a language that allows object-oriented programming. But that's not much of a definition: <em>all</em> languages allow object-oriented programming, therefore <em>all</em> languages are object-oriented? So, you say, well a language is object-oriented, if it <em>forces</em> you to programming in an object-oriented style. But that's not much of a definition, either: <em>all</em> languages allow functional programming, therefore <em>no</em> language is object-oriented?</p>

<p>So, for me, I have found the following definition:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A language is a scripting language (object-oriented language / functional language) if it <em>both</em></p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><em>facilitates</em> scripting (object-oriented programming / functional programming), i.e. it not only <em>allows</em> it but makes it <em>easy</em> and <em>natural</em> and contains features that <em>help</em> with it, <em>AND</em></li>
  <li><em>encourages</em> and <em>guides</em> you towards scripting (object-oriented programming / functional programming).</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>So, after five paragraphs, I have arrived at: ""a scripting language is a language for scripting"". What a great definition. NOT.</p>

<p>Obviously, we now need to look at the definition of ""scripting"".</p>

<p>This is where the third problem comes in: whereas the term ""functional programming"" is well-defined and it's only the term ""functional programming language"" that is problematic, unfortunately with scripting, <em>both</em> the term ""scripting"" and the term ""scripting language"" are ill-defined.</p>

<p>Well, firstly scripting <em>is</em> programming. It's just a special kind of programming. IOW: every script is a program, but not every program is a script; the set of all scripts is a proper subset of the set of all programs.</p>

<p>In my personal opinion, the thing that makes scripting scripting and distinguishes it from other kinds of programming, is that &hellip;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Scripts largely manipulate objects that</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>were not created by the script,</li>
  <li>have a lifetime independent of the script and</li>
  <li>live outside the domain of the script.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Also, the datatypes and algorithms used are generally not defined by the script but by the outside environment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Think about a shell script: shell scripts usually manipulate files, directories and processes. The majority of files, directories and processes on your system were probably not created by the currently running script. And they don't vanish when the script exits: their lifetime is completely independent of the script. And they aren't really part of the script, either, they are a part of the system. You didn't start your script by writing <code>File</code> and <code>Directory</code> classes, those datatypes are none of your concern: you just assume they are there, and you don't even know (nor do you <em>need</em> to know) how they work. And you don't implement your own algorithms, either, e.g. for directory traversal you just use <code>find</code> instead of implementing your own breadth-first-search.</p>

<p>In short: a script attaches itself to a larger system that exists independently of the script, manipulates some small part of the system and then exits.</p>

<p>That larger system can be the operating system in case of a shell script, the browser DOM in case of a browser script, a game (e.g. World of Warcraft with Lua or Second Life with the Linden Scripting Language), an application (e.g. the AutoLisp language for AutoCAD or Excel/Word/Office macros), a web server, a pack of robots or something else entirely.</p>

<p>Note that the scripting aspect is completely orthogonal to all the other aspects of programming languages: a scripting language can be strongly or weakly typed, strictly or loosely typed, statically or dynamically typed, nominally, structurally or duck typed, heck it can even be untyped. It can be imperative or functional, object-oriented, procedural or functional, strict or lazy. Its implementations can be interpreted, compiled or mixed.</p>

<p>For example, Mondrian is a strictly strongly statically typed lazy functional scripting language with a compiled implementation.</p>

<p>However, all of this is moot, because the way the term <em>scripting language</em> is <em>really</em> used in the real world, has nothing to do with any of the above. It is most often used simply as an insult, and the definition is rather simple, even simplistic:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li><em>real</em> programming language: my programming language</li>
  <li>scripting language: your programming language</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>This seems to be the way that the term is most often used.</p>

"<p>My 7 year old would like to learn, how to program? (his idea not mine, and he does things in the outside world. So, I am not too worried from that point of view. He already went so far as to take a game programming book out of my office to read at bed time.) The other day we sat down and wrote a very simple number guessing game (you pick 8 and it is correct, anything else it is wrong).  </p>

<p>It went OK but there were a number of questions he had based on the syntax of the language. (I happened to pick Java as I had the IDE opened at the time.)  I teach post-secondary introductory programming courses so this was a bit of an eye opener to me (most students out of high school are reluctant to ask questions) as I really had to figure out, how to explain syntax to a 7 year old?</p>

<p>Clearly any C type language is going to have the same issues, as will most “languages”. I looked at squeak but decided not to use it yet. I looked at the Alice environment but didn't like it for this either.</p>

<p>From a physical point of view he is comfortable with a keyboard/mouse and can put together Lego sets with relative ease (so following directions with a fun outcome works for him). I have access to Lego NXT but he is still a bit young for that (it takes too long to see the results of the work, even with the supplied graphical environment). </p>

<p>Ideally I'd like the experience to help him build up confidence in math and logic (if a 7 year old has logic:-).</p>

<p>I remember using turtle graphics/logo as a child. I am leaning towards this but wondering if there are any other ideas or if anyone can recommend a good logo environment?</p>

<p>Edit 1:</p>

<p>Logo works out well.  I'll need to teach him the concept of angles (90 degrees, 180 degrees).  Unfortunalty they don't really do division at school yet so angles might be fun...</p>

<p>First off draw a square:</p>

<pre><code>FORWARD 50
RIGHT 90
FORWARD 50
RIGHT 90
FORWARD 50
RIGHT 90
FORWARD 50
RIGHT 90
</code></pre>

<p>At some point later I'll go into loops:</p>

<pre><code>REPEAT 4 
[
    FORWARD 50
    RIGHT 90
]
</code></pre>

<p>And then variables:</p>

<pre><code>make ""length 50

REPEAT 4 
[
    FORWARD :length
    RIGHT 90
]
</code></pre>

<p>This works out very well.  Virtually no syntax, easy for a 7 year old to remember the vocabulary, and immediate feedback.</p>

<p>Edit 2:</p>

<p>Well it was a success, in that he was able to write a simple program (no loops yet) while I was out of the room.  It actually works out very well - we went out and got to graph paper and a protractor, we fugured out 90 degree angles, and he made a bunch of squares, turned a square into a rectangle, and got to see where he went wrong and how to debug it.  I'd recommend this approach for anyone with a 7 year old who is interested in programming.  I think I'd recommend it to my post-secondary students too (!)</p>

","2988","","<p>A test is not a unit test if it is not testing a unit.</p>

<p>Seriously, that's all there is to it.</p>

<p>The concept of ""unit"" in unit testing is not well-defined, in fact, the best definition I have found so far, isn't actually a definition because it is circular: a unit in a unit test is the smallest possible thing that can be tested in isolation.</p>

<p>This gives you two checkpoints: is it tested in isolation? And is it the smallest possible thing?</p>

<p>Please note that both of these are context-dependent. What might be the smallest possible thing in one situation (say, an entire object) might in another situation just one small piece of one single method. And what counts as isolation in one situation might be in another (e.g. in a memory-managed language, you <em>never</em> run in isolation from the garbage collector, and most of the time that is irrelevant, but sometimes it might not be).</p>

"<p>With the Ruby 1.9.2 release on the horizon, it's time to get developers excited about Ruby 1.9. What are some nice things you can do in Ruby 1.9 that you can't do in Ruby 1.8?</p>
","2988","","<p>I can't believe that this hasn't been mentioned yet: the single biggest feature of Ruby 1.9.2+ is that for the first time in 17 years, Ruby will have a specification.</p>

<p>You might have heard that all release schedule for Ruby 1.9.2 (which was supposed to be released in the Spring of 2010) <a href=""http://Ruby-Forum.Com/topic/195825/#853518"">has been canceled</a>, and this is the reason: first, a complete specification of Ruby 1.9.2 will be developed in the RubySpec project, then Ruby 1.9.2 (the programming language) will be released, and only then will YARV 1.9.2 be released, <em>after</em> it passes the RubySpec testsuite.</p>

<p>This is exactly backwards from how it worked before: first MRI was released, then all the other implementors read the (not very well designed, and generally badly documented) C source code of MRI, to try and figure out what the heck that new feature was supposed to do, then they tried to write executable specifications, and only then did they even have a remote chance of actual compatibility. But by that time, generally, a new version of YARV had already been released, and the cycle began anew ... Not to mention that the maintainers of MRI and YARV didn't even run the RubySpecs.</p>

<p>This has <em>huge</em> ramifications. For example, despite the fact that currently more than a dozen different Ruby implementations are in active development, and over the years of its existence there have been more than 30 different implementations of the Ruby programming language, this fact has <em>not</em> been acknowledged by the maintainers of the Ruby programming language. For them, Ruby and MRI (or more recently Ruby and YARV) have always been one and the same thing: MRI was both the language and the execution engine, Ruby was both the execution engine and the language. The ""specification"" of the Ruby programming language was the C source code of MRI.</p>

<p>As of five weeks ago, this has changed: now, the official specification of the Ruby programming language (at least version 1.9.2 and later) is the executable testsuite of the RubySpec project. And YARV is just another Ruby implementation, completely equal to MacRuby, IronRuby, JRuby, Cardinal, tinyrb, SmallRuby, BlueRuby, MagLev and the others.</p>

<p>This means that so called ""alternate"" implementations (which as of now should no longer be called ""alternate"" because YARV has lost its special status) now have a chance to actually catch up with the latest language features implemented in YARV. In fact, since most of the other implementations are actually both much better designed and implemented in much better languages than YARV (which is basically a huge spaghetti mess of C), plus having more manpower, it is entirely plausible that other implementations will actually be Ruby 1.9.2 compliant <em>before</em> YARV.</p>

"<p><em>First note the inflammatory subject title is a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%5Flongest%5Fsuicide%5Fnote%5Fin%5Fhistory"">quotation made about the manifesto of a UK political party</a> in the early 1980s</em>. This question is subjective but it is a genuine question, I've made it CW and I'd like some opinions on the matter.</p>

<p>Despite whatever my wife and coworkers keep telling me, I don't think I'm an idiot: I have a good degree in mathematics from the <a href=""http://www.ox.ac.uk/"">University of Oxford</a> and I've been programming commercially for almost 12 years and in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scala%5F%28programming%5Flanguage%29"">Scala</a> for about a year (also commercially).</p>

<p>I have just started to look at the <a href=""http://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala/browser/scala/trunk/src/library/scala/collection"">Scala collections library re-implementation</a> which is coming in the imminent <strong>2.8</strong> release. Those familiar with the library from 2.7 will notice that the library, from a usage perspective, has changed little. For example...</p>

<pre><code>&gt; List(""Paris"", ""London"").map(_.length) 
res0: List[Int] List(5, 6)
</code></pre>

<p>...would work in either versions. <strong>The library is eminently useable</strong>: in fact it's fantastic. However, those previously unfamiliar with Scala and <em>poking around to get a feel for the language</em> now have to make sense of method signatures like:</p>

<pre><code>def map[B, That](f: A =&gt; B)(implicit bf: CanBuildFrom[Repr, B, That]): That
</code></pre>

<p>For such simple functionality, this is a daunting signature and one which I find myself struggling to understand. <strong>Not that I think Scala was ever likely to be the next Java</strong> (or /C/C++/C#) - I don't believe its creators were aiming it at that market - but I think it is/was certainly feasible for Scala to become the next Ruby or Python (i.e. to gain a significant commercial user-base)   </p>

<ul>
<li>Is this going to put people off coming to Scala?</li>
<li>Is this going to give Scala a bad name in the commercial world as an <em>academic plaything</em> that only dedicated PhD students can understand? Are <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief%5Ftechnical%5Fofficer"">CTO</a>s and heads of software going to get scared off?</li>
<li>Was the library re-design a sensible idea?</li>
<li>If you're using Scala commercially, are you worried about this? Are you planning to adopt 2.8 immediately or wait to see what happens?</li>
</ul>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve%5FYegge"">Steve Yegge</a> <a href=""http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/06/rhinos-and-tigers.html"">once attacked Scala</a> (mistakenly in my opinion) for what he saw as its overcomplicated type-system. I worry that someone is going to have a field day spreading <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,%5Funcertainty%5Fand%5Fdoubt"">fud</a> with this API (similarly to how Josh Bloch scared the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java%5FCommunity%5FProcess"">JCP</a> out of adding closures to Java).</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong> - <em>I should be clear that, whilst I believe that Josh Bloch was influential in the rejection of the BGGA closures proposal, I don't ascribe this to anything other than his honestly-held beliefs that the proposal represented a mistake.</em> </p>
","2988","","<p>I do not have a PhD, nor any other kind of degree neither in CS nor math nor indeed any other field. I have no prior experience with Scala nor any other similar language. I have no experience with even remotely comparable type systems. In fact, the only language that I have more than just a superficial knowledge of which even <em>has</em> a type system is Pascal, not exactly known for its sophisticated type system. (Although it <em>does</em> have range types, which AFAIK pretty much no other language has, but that isn't really relevant here.) The other three languages I know are BASIC, Smalltalk and Ruby, none of which even have a type system.</p>

<p>And yet, I have no trouble at all understanding the signature of the <code>map</code> function you posted. It looks to me like pretty much the same signature that <code>map</code> has in every other language I have ever seen. The difference is that this version is more generic. It looks more like a C++ STL thing than, say, Haskell. In particular, it abstracts away from the concrete collection type by only requiring that the argument is <code>IterableLike</code>, and also abstracts away from the concrete return type by only requiring that an implicit conversion  function exists which can build <em>something</em> out of that collection of result values. Yes, that is quite complex, but it really is only an expression of the general paradigm of generic programming: do not assume anything that you don't actually have to.</p>

<p>In this case, <code>map</code> does not actually <em>need</em> the collection to be a list, or being ordered or being sortable or anything like that. The only thing that <code>map</code> cares about is that it can get access to all elements of the collection, one after the other, but in no particular order. And it does not need to know what the resulting collection is, it only needs to know how to build it. So, that is what its type signature requires.</p>

<p>So, instead of</p>

<pre><code>map :: (a → b) → [a] → [b]
</code></pre>

<p>which is the traditional type signature for <code>map</code>, it is generalized to not require a concrete <code>List</code> but rather just an <code>IterableLike</code> data structure</p>

<pre><code>map :: (IterableLike i, IterableLike j) ⇒ (a → b) → i → j
</code></pre>

<p>which is then further generalized by only requiring that a function exists that can <em>convert</em> the result to whatever data structure the user wants:</p>

<pre><code>map :: IterableLike i ⇒ (a → b) → i → ([b] → c) → c
</code></pre>

<p>I admit that the syntax is a bit clunkier, but the semantics are the same. Basically, it starts from </p>

<pre><code>def map[B](f: (A) ⇒ B): List[B]
</code></pre>

<p>which is the traditional signature for <code>map</code>. (Note how due to the object-oriented nature of Scala, the input list parameter vanishes, because it is now the implicit receiver parameter that every method in a single-dispatch OO system has.) Then it generalized from a concrete <code>List</code> to a more general <code>IterableLike</code></p>

<pre><code>def map[B](f: (A) ⇒ B): IterableLike[B]
</code></pre>

<p>Now, it replaces the <code>IterableLike</code> result collection with a function that <em>produces</em>, well, really just about anything.</p>

<pre><code>def map[B, That](f: A ⇒ B)(implicit bf: CanBuildFrom[Repr, B, That]): That
</code></pre>

<p>Which I really believe is not <em>that</em> hard to understand. There's really only a couple of intellectual tools you need:</p>

<ol>
<li>You need to know (roughly) what <code>map</code> is. If you gave <em>only</em> the type signature without the name of the method, I admit, it would be a lot harder to figure out what is going on. But since you already <em>know</em> what <code>map</code> is supposed to do, and you know what its type signature is supposed to be, you can quickly scan the signature and focus on the anomalies, like ""why does this <code>map</code> take two functions as arguments, not one?""</li>
<li>You need to be able to actually <em>read</em> the type signature. But even if you have never seen Scala before, this should be quite easy, since it really is just a mixture of type syntaxes you already know from other lanugages: VB.NET uses square brackets for parametric polymorphism, and using an arrow to denote the return type and a colon to seperate name and type, is actually the norm.</li>
<li>You need to know roughly what generic programming is about. (Which isn't <em>that</em> hard to figure out, since it's basically all spelled out in the name: it's literally just programming in a generic fashion).</li>
</ol>

<p>None of these three should give any professional or even hobbyist programmer a serious headache. <code>map</code> has been a standard function in pretty much every language designed in the last 50 years, the fact that different languages have different syntax should be obvious to anyone who has designed a website with HTML and CSS and you can't subscribe to an even remotely programing related mailinglist without some annoying C++ fanboi from the chucrh of St. Stepanov explaining the virtues of generic programming.</p>

<p>Yes, Scala <em>is</em> complex. Yes, Scala has one of the most sophisticated type systems known to man, rivaling and even surpassing languages like Haskell, Miranda, Clean or Cyclone. But if complexity were an argument against success of a programming language, C++ would have died long ago and we would all be writing Scheme. There are lots of reasons why Scala will very likely not be successful, but the fact that programmers can't be bothered to turn on their brains before sitting down in front of the keyboard is probably not going to be the main one.</p>

"<p>I've accidentally stumbled upon an old <a href=""http://lukeredpath.co.uk/blog/developing-a-rails-model-using-bdd-and-rspec-part-1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">article</a> by Luke Redpath that presents a very simple BDD example (very short and easy to follow even for non-Ruby programmers like me). I found the end result very incomplete, thus making the example pretty useless.</p>

<p>The end result is a single test which verifies that a user with preset attributes is valid. In my view, this is simply not enough to verify the validation rules correctly. For example, if you change</p>

<pre><code>validates_length_of :password, :in =&gt; 6..12, :allow_nil =&gt; :true
</code></pre>

<p>to</p>

<pre><code>validates_length_of :password, :in =&gt; 7..8, :allow_nil =&gt; :true
</code></pre>

<p>(or even remove password length validation completely) the test will still pass, but you can obviously see the code is now violating the initial requirements.</p>

<p>I just think the last refactoring of putting all the individual tests into a single one is simply not enough. He tests only the ""happy path"" which doesn't guarantee much. I would absolutely have all the tests that verify that the correct error is triggered with certain values. In the case of the password, I would test that a password of length less than 6 and greater than 12 is invalid and triggers the appropriate error. The ""happy path"" test would be there as well, but not alone by itself as it's in the article.</p>

<p>What's your opinion? I'm just trying to figure out why the guy did it the way he did and whether he simply overlooked the problem or it was his intention. I may be missing something.</p>
","2988","","<p>I don't quite understand your question. The specs <em>do</em> contain expectations about the password lenght, both for the happy path <em>and</em> the two different failure modes (password too long and password too short):</p>

<pre><code>specify ""should be valid with a full set of valid attributes"" do
  @user.attributes = valid_user_attributes
  @user.should_be_valid
end
</code></pre>

<p>This takes care of the happy path, since <code>valid_user_attributes</code> contains a valid password.</p>

<pre><code>specify ""should be invalid if password is not between 6 and 12 characters in length"" do
  @user.attributes = valid_user_attributes.except(:password)
  @user.password = 'abcdefghijklm'
  @user.should_not_be_valid
  @user.password = 'abcde'
  @user.should_not_be_valid
end
</code></pre>

<p>And this tests the two failure modes.</p>

<p>Granted, there is one boundary case missing (12 characters), but that's not too bad.</p>

"<p>Not only Compact Framework.

Also, they wouldn't have started building Silverlight if they hadn't <em>alrady</em> had a working build of .NET for OSX.</p>

<p>So, .NET <em>is</em> portable. It's just that Microsoft will never port it.</p>

"<p>ASP is a Compiled Language or isnt it? sure it is.
PHP is a Interpreted Language. 
I also developed once an asp app with the VS 2008 IDE.
But there is a Big difference between ASP and PHP. 
What are the Differences? </p>
","2988","","<blockquote>
  <p>ASP is a Compiled Language or isnt it? sure it is.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, it isn't.</p>

<p>The first reason why ASP is not a compiled language is because there is <em>no such thing</em> as a compiled language. A language is neither compiled nor interpreted. A language just <em>is</em>. A language is a bunch of abstract mathematical rules. Interpretation or Compilation are traits of a language <em>implementation</em>, they have <em>nothing</em> to do with the language. <em>Every</em> language can be implemented by either a compiler or an interpreter; most modern high-performance language implementations actually use <em>both</em> and switch between them depending on which one is faster in a particular context.</p>

<p>The second reason why ASP is not a compiled language is because it is not a language. It is a framework. You can write code for ASP in <em>any</em> language for which an ActiveScripting engine exists (e.g. Ruby via ActiveRuby), but most commonly one would write code in either VBScript or JScript.</p>

<p>Which brings us to the third reason: The implementations of VBScript and JScript that ship with Windows, as well as ActiveRuby and all other ActiveScripting engines that I know of, are <em>pure interpreters</em>, they <em>cannot</em> compile. So, even though I wrote above that <em>any</em> language <em>can</em> be implemented using either a compiler or an interpreter, <em>all</em> the language execution engines that are supported by ASP are <em>interpreted</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>PHP is a Interpreted Language.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again: no, it isn't.</p>

<p>Reason one is the same as above: there simply is no such thing as an interpreted language.</p>

<p>And, in contrast to ASP, the vast majority of PHP implementations actually <em>do</em> contain a compiler. Some even are <em>pure</em> compilers, they don't even <em>have</em> an interpreter. (Phalanger, for example always compiles straight to CIL, with no interpretation whatsoever. P8 can either interpret or compile straight to JVM bytecode or both: interpret, gather profile data while interpreting and then JIT-compile to JVM bytecode.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But there is a Big difference between ASP and PHP. What are the Differences?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>ASP is a (language-independent) framework, PHP is a language. That's a rather big difference. (Actually, PHP contains one small bit that would in other languages usually considered to be part of a web framework: webserver integration.)</p>

<p>PHP is highly portable across operating systems, CPU architectures and webservers: there is a PHP implementation for nearly every execution environment, from the JVM to the CLI to Parrot to running natively on pretty much every operating system under the sun.

"<p>I'm well aware of the whole argument over whether or not checked exceptions are a good idea and I fall on the side that they are...but that is not the point of this question. I'm in the process of designing a fairly simple compiled OOP language and I've decided to use checked exceptions basically as a way of returning errors without going down the C route of returning error codes.</p>

<p>I'm looking for some insight as to how I could improve on the Java model of checked exceptions to eliminate most of their bad aspects, perhaps a syntactic change or changing the actual functionality slightly. One of the main criticisms against checked exceptions is that lazy programmers are likely to swallow them and so errors would not appear.</p>

<p>Perhaps it could be optional to catch exceptions and therefore if one is not caught the program would crash? Or maybe there could be specific notation to denote that an exception is not being handled (like the C++ virtual function '= 0' notation)? Or I could even cause the program to crash if the exception handler is empty (though this might surprise programmers new to the language)?</p>

<p>How about the try...catch syntax, do you think there could be a more concise way of expressing that an exception is being caught? The language will use a garbage collector, much like Java, so is there any need for the finally clause? Finally, what other disadvantages are there to checked exceptions and what potential solutions (if any) exist?</p>
","2988","","<p>Checked Exceptions are just a small instance of a more general drive towards what Erik Meijer calls <em>type honesty</em>. I.e. procedures, methods, functions should not lie with their types. If you see a type signature, you should be able to trust its type.</p>

<p>This is not true for Java today (especially if you imagine a Java-- without Checked Exceptions).</p>

<p>If you have a type signature like this in Java:</p>

<pre><code>Foo bar(Baz)
</code></pre>

<p>it says ""I take a <code>Baz</code> as input and produce a <code>Foo</code> as output"". But that's a lie.</p>

<p>Actually, <code>bar</code> takes <em>either</em> a <code>Baz</code> <em>or</em> <code>null</code> as input. It also takes the <em>entire</em> global state, class state and instance state as input, as well as the entire universe, really (via e.g. file I/O, network I/O, database I/O and so forth). And it does not produce a <code>Baz</code> as output either: it produces <em>either</em> a <code>Foo</code> <em>or</em> <code>null</code> <em>or</em> an Exception <em>or</em> <code>Bottom</code> (i.e. nothing at all). <em>Plus</em> its output also includes the entire global state, the entire class state, the entire instance state and really also the entire state of the universe.</p>

<p><code>bar</code>'s <em>actual</em> type is:</p>

<pre><code>(IO&lt;Foo | null | Exception&gt; | Bottom) bar(IO&lt;Baz | null&gt;)
</code></pre>

<p>or something like that.</p>

<p>This needs to be fixed, and Checked Exceptions are a (very small) part of that. I personally think that the other parts are more important and the Java designers should have concentrated on fixing <em>those</em> rather than exceptions (especially since exceptions are just side-effects, anyway and so you actually pretty much automatically fix exceptions for free when you fix side-effects).</p>

<p>Anyway, this is why I believe that the general idea <em>behind</em> Checked Exceptions is a Good Thing&trade;, even if the specific implementation in Java might be a bit cumbersome.</p>

<p>How to fix Checked Exceptions depends a lot on what exactly you think is actually <em>wrong</em> with them.</p>

<p>Some people believe that the problem with Checked Exceptions is that when you change the internal implementation of your method to use a different helper method than it did before, which throws a different set of exceptions than the old one, you need to either explicitly handle those exceptions or declare them, thus breaking all your clients. Now, if that is what you think is wrong with Checked Exceptions, then there is only way to fix them: don't have them in the first place. Changing the exceptions you throw <em>is</em> a breaking change in your API contract, and breaking changes in your API contract <em>should</em> break client code. (Or more precisely: you shouldn't make breaking changes to your API contract, in order to <em>not</em> break client code.)</p>

<p>I believe that the main problem with Checked Exceptions as implemented by Java is that they break one of the main features of exceptions: non-local error handling. An error happens way over here, and is handled way over there, and these two are the only ones that need to know about it. If a different kind of error can happen over here, then the <em>only</em> place that needs to know about that new error and the only place that needs to <em>change</em> is the error handler over there.</p>

<p>With Checked Exceptions as implemented in Java, every piece of code in between <em>also</em> needs to change.</p>

<p>One proposal to fix this problem, are <a href=""http://WWW.CS.KULeuven.Be/publicaties/rapporten/cw/CW407.abs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Anchored Exception Declarations</a>. (Improved in <a href=""http://WWW.CS.KULeuven.Be/publicaties/rapporten/cw/CW544.abs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Modular Anchored Exception Declarations</a>.)</p>

<p>The idea of Anchored Exception Declarations is basically to use <em>delegation</em> for the exception declarations the same way that you use delegation in the method body, which is after all what creates the problem in the first place.</p>

<p>Say you have some file reader method which delegates to another method:</p>

<pre><code>String fileReader(String filename) {
  return this.fileHelper.read(filename);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now you go into the JavaDoc for <code>FileHelper#read</code> and cut&amp;paste the exception list into your method:</p>

<pre><code>String fileReader(String filename) throws IOException, CustomFileReaderEx
</code></pre>

<p>Now the author of <code>FileHelper#read</code> decides that he uses a different implementation strategy. Now he makes sure that the <em>actual</em> file read never can fail, by first ensuring that the file exists, can be opened, and is of the right format. So, naturally, the set of exceptions changes. It is no longer possible to get an <code>IOException</code> or a <code>CustomFileReaderEx</code>. Instead you can get a <code>InvalidFilenameEx</code> or <code>CorruptDataEx</code>. So, you cut&amp;paste again:</p>

<pre><code>String fileReader(String filename) throws InvalidFilenameEx, CorruptDataEx
</code></pre>

<p>Not only did <em>you</em> have to make that change, but everybody else who calls <code>fileReader</code> (and everybody who calls them and everybody who calls them and ...) as well. That's crazy! The reason why you delegated the call to the <code>fileHelper</code> in the first place was so that you need not concern yourself with those details.</p>

<p>So, the idea of Anchored Exception Declarations is to use this delegation for the Exception Declarations themselves. Instead of saying which <em>precise</em> exceptions you throw, you just blame someone else. ""He did it!"":</p>

<pre><code>String fileReader(String filename) throws like this.fileHelper.read
</code></pre>

<p>And your clients just say:</p>

<pre><code>Foo whatever() throws like fileReader
</code></pre>

<p>That way, when <code>FileHelper</code> changes its exceptions, then the <em>only</em> code that needs to change is the very top-level exception handling code, just like I described above for the <em>unchecked</em> case.</p>

<p>There are restrictions, of course. For example, in order to not break encapsulation, you can only use identifiers in your <code>throws like</code> clause which are accessible to all your clients. If, in this case, <code>fileHelper</code> is a <code>private</code> field, you cannot use it. You would need some other way. For example, if the <code>FileHelper</code> class is <code>public</code> (or if it is package private <em>and</em> all your clients live in the same package), you could instead say</p>

<pre><code>String fileReader(String filename) throws like FileHelper.read
</code></pre>

<p>There are other restrictions listed in the paper as well. (One of those is lifted in the Modular Anchored Exception Declarations paper.)</p>

<p>Anyway, this is <em>one</em> way to ameliorate some of the problems with Checked Exceptions. However, Checked Exceptions have been around for almost 40 years now, and we still haven't figured them out, so it's <em>obviously</em> a hard problem.</p>

"<p>I found out after testing that linux allows any character in a file name except for <code>/</code> and null (<code>\0</code>). So what sequence should I not allow in a filename? I heard a leading <code>-</code> may confuse some command line programs, which doesn't matter to me, however it may bother other people if they decide to collect a bunch of files and filter it with some GNU programs.</p>

<p>It was suggested to me to remove leading and trailing spaces and I plan to only because typically the user doesn't mean to have leading/trailing space.</p>

<p>What problematic sequence might there be and what sequence should I consider not allowing?
I am also considering not allowing characters illegal in windows just for convenience. I think I may not allow dashes at the beginning (dash is a legal window character)</p>
","2988","","<p>Your question is somewhat confusing since you talk at length about Linux, but then in a comment to another answer you say that you are generating filenames for people to download, which presumably means that you have absolutely no control whatsoever over the filesystem and operating system that the files will be stored on, making Linux completely irrelevant.</p>

<p>For the purpose of this answer I'm going to assume that your question is wrong and your comment is correct.</p>

<p>The vast majority of operating systems and filesystems in use today fall roughly into three categories: POSIX, Windows and MacOS.</p>

<p>The POSIX specification is very clear on what a filename that is guaranteed to be portable across <em>all</em> POSIX systems looks like. The characters that you can use are defined in <a href=""http://OpenGroup.Org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap03.html#tag_03_276"">Section 3.276 (Portable Filename Character Set) of the Open Group Base Specification</a> as:<pre>ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
0123456789._-</pre>The maximum filename length that you can rely on is defined in <a href=""http://OpenGroup.Org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/limits.h.html#tag_13_23_03_05"">Section 13.23.3.5 (<code>&lt;limits.h&gt;</code> Minimum Values)</a> as <code>14</code>. (The relevant constant is <code>_POSIX_NAME_MAX</code>.)</p>

<p>So, a filename which is up to 14 characters long and contains only the 65 characters listed above, is safe to use on all POSIX compliant systems, which gives you 24407335764928225040435790 combinations (or roughly 84 bits).</p>

<p>If you don't want to annoy your users, you should add two more restrictions: don't start the filename with a dash or a dot. Filenames starting with a dot are customarily interpreted as ""hidden"" files and are not displayed in directory listings unless explicitly requested. And filenames starting with a dash may be interpreted as an option by many commands. (Sidenote: it is amazing how many users don't know about the <code>rm ./-rf</code> or <code>rm -- -rf</code> tricks.)</p>

<p>This leaves you at 23656340818315048885345458 combinations (still 84 bits).</p>

<p>Windows adds a couple of new restrictions to this: filenames cannot end with a dot and filenames are case-insensitive. This reduces the character set from 65 to 39 characters (37 for the first, 38 for the last character). It doesn't add any length restrictions, Windows can deal with 14 characters just fine.</p>

<p>This reduces the possible combinations to 17866587696996781449603 (73 bits).</p>

<p>Another restriction is that Windows treats everything after the last dot as a filename extension which denotes the type of the file. If you want to avoid potential confusion (say, if you generate a filename like <code>abc.mp3</code> for a text file), you should avoid dots altogether.</p>

<p>You still have 13090925539866773438463 combinations (73 bits).</p>

<p>If you have to worry about DOS, then additional restrictions apply: the filename consists of one or two parts (seperated by a dot), where neither of the two parts can contain a dot. The first part has a maximum length of 8, the second of 3 characters. Again, the second part is usually reserved to indicate the file type, which leaves you only 8 characters.</p>

<p>Now you have 4347792138495 possible filenames or 41 bits.</p>

<p>The good news is that you can use the 3 character extension to actually <em>correctly</em> indicate the file type, without breaking the POSIX filename limit (8+3+1 = 12 &lt; 14).</p>

<p>If you want your users to be able to burn the files onto a CD-R formatted with ISO9660 Level 1, then you have to disallow hyphen anywhere, not just as the first character. Now, the remaining character set looks like<pre>ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
0123456789_</pre>which gives you 3512479453921 combinations (41 bits).</p>

"<p>I'm currently working on the topic of programming-languages and interpreter-design. I have already created several programming languages but couldn't reach my goal so far:</p>

<p>Create a programming-language which focuses on giving the programmer a <em>good feeling</em> when writing code in it. It should just be fun and/or interesting and in no case annoying to write something in it. </p>

<p>I get this feeling when writing code in Python. I sometimes get the opposite with PHP and in rare cases when having to reinvent some wheel in C++.</p>

","2988","","<p>You mentioned Ruby in your question. AFAIK, Ruby is the <em>only</em> programming language, for which <em>Joy</em> is an actual, stated, explicit design goal. (In fact, it is the <em>only</em> design goal.)</p>

<p>The reason that Yukihiro Matsumoto was able to design Ruby this way, is that he already knew and used <em>tons</em> of programming languages <em>before</em> he started designing Ruby and learned tons more <em>in order to</em> design Ruby. (Interestingly, he didn't know Python, and has said that he probably wouldn't have created Ruby if he did.)</p>

<p>Here's just a tiny fraction of the languages that matz has either used himself, or looked at for inspiration (or in some cases for inspiration what <em>not</em> to do):</p>

<ul>
<li>CLU</li>
<li>Sather</li>
<li>Lisp</li>
<li>Scheme</li>
<li>Smalltalk</li>
<li>Perl</li>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Haskell</li>
<li>Scala</li>
<li>PHP</li>
<li>C</li>
<li>C++</li>
<li>Java</li>
<li>C#</li>
<li>Objective-C</li>
<li>Erlang</li>
</ul>

<p>And I believe that this is one way that good programming languages can be designed (what Larry Wall calls <em>postmodernist language design</em>): Throw away everything that didn't work in the past, take everything that worked and combine that tastefully.</p>

<p>Of course, this requires that you actually <em>know</em> all those languages from which you want to ""steal"" and in particular, it requires that you know lots of very <em>different</em> languages with different paradigms, different concepts and different ""feels"", otherwise the idea pool from which you steal is rather small and inbred.</p>

","2988","","<p>What an interesting question! It inspired me to take a shot at the problem, too. Here's my solution.</p>

<p>First, some preparatory work:</p>

<pre><code>class Enumerator
  def lazy_select
    Enumerator.new do |y|
      each do |el|
        y.yield(el) if yield el
      end

  alias_method :lazy_find_all, :lazy_select

module Enumerable
  def sum
    reduce(:+)

end

module Math
  ROOT5 = Math.sqrt(5)
  PHI = 0.5 + ROOT5/2

  def self.fibonacci(n)
    Integer(0.5 + PHI**n/ROOT5)
  end
end

class Integer
  def fibonacci
    Math.fibonacci(self)
  end
end

<p>Now an <code>Enumerator</code> which generates an infinite sequence of Fibonacci Numbers:</p>

<pre><code>fibs = Enumerator.new do |y|
  n = -1
  loop do
    y.yield (n += 1).fibonacci
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>And the nice thing is that we can now <em>directly</em> express the original problem statement in code:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Find the sum of all the even-valued terms in the sequence which do not exceed four million.</p>

<pre><code>puts fibs.lazy_find_all(&amp;:even?).take_while {|n| n &lt;= 4_000_000 }.sum

<p>I think that this is a much more Rubyish way to solve the problem. You write in your question that you are terrible with Ruby. But that's not actually the problem.

<p>Two good examples are:</p>

<p>However, nobody actually uses this specification.

<p>The three main differences between the ISO Draft Specification and RubySpec are:</p>

<ol>
<li>RubySpec is <em>complete</em>: it covers the entire Ruby language, and the entire core library, from version 1.8.7 to 1.9.2 and 1.9.3. The ISO Draft Specification only covers a very small subset of the intersection of 1.8 and 1.9.</li>
<li>RubySpec is written in <em>Ruby</em> (which is a language that every Rubyist can read), the ISO Draft Specification is written in English, or rather in ISO Standardese (which is a language that only a handful of people on the planet can fully understand).</li>
<li>RubySpec is <em>executable</em>: you can just run it against your Ruby implementation to see what you are still missing.</li>

<p>Take, for example, a simplified portion of code from <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3389588/how-should-i-model-my-code-to-maximize-code-re-use-in-this-specific-situation"">my previous question</a>:</p>

<pre><code>public class OutboxManager
{
    private IVendorMessenger _VendorMessenger;

    //This is the default constructor, forcing the consumer to provide
    //the implementation of IVendorMessenger.
    public OutboxManager(IVendorMessenger messenger)
    {
         _VendorMessenger = messenger;
    }

    public void DistributeOutboxMessages()
    {
        VendorMessenger.SendMessageToVendor()
                      _OutboxMgrDataProvider.MarkMessageAsProcessed(om)
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>Currently, if someone wants to consume this class, they have to code a class that implements <code>IVendorMessenger</code> and provide it during initialization as a parameter:</p>

<pre><code> var MyOutboxManger = new OutboxManager(new MyVendorMessenger())
</code></pre>

<p>What if, instead of hard-coding the interface parameter, it instead gets assinged at runtime?  This way, I could compile a dll for a class that implements <code>IVendorMessenger</code>, drop it into the same folder that <code>OutboxManagerExecutable</code> exists, and it will wire everything up at run time.  I suppose, using this logic, I could figure out a way to drop <em>multiple</em> implementations of <code>IVendorMessenger</code> in the same folder and design the executable to be smart enough to iterate through all appropriate dlls and consume them accordingly.</p>

<p>Is this type of functionality possible in .NET 4?</p>
","2988","","<p>EDIT: I just realized that I misunderstood the question. The question does <em>not</em>, in fact, seem to be about assigning an interface to an object at runtime, but rather about late binding type names.</p>

<p>This is usually called <em>Interface Injection</em>, and has been on the wishlist for both the CLI and the JVM for as long as they exist.</p>

<p>Especially the people who write implementations for programming languages that were not natively designed for the CLI or the JVM, like JRuby, XRuby, Ruby.NET, IronRuby, IronPython, Jython, Rhino, IronJS, etc. have this feature high on their wishlist, because it means that they do no longer have to maintain a parallel type hierarchy and marshal objects back and forth between the two.</p>

<p>However, they don't seem to be on the horizon any time soon, or indeed at all, although there is at least a strawman spec for the JVM with an accompanying partial prototype implementation for the Da Vinci Machine.</p>

","2988","","<p>Yes, Ruby on Rails sites do have performance issues, just like any other site. And just like any other site, those performance almost always are rooted in architectural decisions, not the language or the framework.</p>

<p>There was a nice presentation a couple of years back by Joyent (might have been RailsConf 2007?), which showed on one slide all the servers that are running on a single instance of their Rails platform. About 40 processes. Only one of those processes was the Ruby interpreter, everything else was stuff like the DNS resolver, web server, database server, MTA, memcached, message queue, reverse proxy, load balancer, etc. Every single one of those can screw up your performance. That's a 97.5% chance that your performance problems have nothing whatsoever to do with Rails or Ruby.</p>

<p>There's some really nice E-Mails on the JRuby mailinglists, and also some Tweets and blog posts by people who rewrote their Java web applications in Ruby and got a 10% performance improvement.</p>

<p>A really good example is Twitter. Twitter is one of the biggest Ruby on Rails sites in the world. It is also one with a very unusual usage pattern that will give <em>any</em> framework that is designed for ""normal"" web applications a tough nut to crack.</p>

<p>Now, you might think, why did I choose <em>Twitter</em> of all things as an example of performance and scalabilit, when clearly it is the exact <em>opposite</em> that they are known for? Well, that's exactly the point: they have had a <em>ton</em> of scaling, performance and reliability problems. And not a <em>single one</em> of those had anything to do with Rails or Ruby. In fact, Rails and Ruby were pretty much the only pieces in their stack that they did <em>not</em> have problems with.</p>

<p>They had problems with unexpected growth. It doesn't matter which language or framework you use: if users are signing on faster than you can buy new servers, there is nothing you can do.</p>

<p>They had problems with the performance and scalability of MySQL. Again, MySQL has nothig to do with Rails or Ruby. In fact, MySQL is written in C, so if you <em>really</em> absolutely <em>must</em> make any ridiculous conclusion about a programming language, based solely on a single incident, then it would be this: C is slow. If you want performance, stay away from C.</p>

<p>(In this particular case, in one interview, they actually <em>did</em> blame Rails: they said that because Rails only supported a single connection to a single database, their MySQL instance simply got overloaded. Within hours of that interview being posted, two Rails developers independently of one another both released Rails plugins to implement multiple connections. The lesson is: only the 80% solutions are in the core. Twitter clearly isn't in the 80%. The plugin API is there for a reason.)</p>

<p>They had problems with the performance and scalability of the overall system. It turned out that, in order to get the product out quickly, they implemented absolutely no caching whatsoever. Even the ""static"" Twitter homepage was completely dynamically generated for every single request. Again, this had nothing to do with Rails or Ruby. You can bring <em>any</em> site down by turning off their caches, I guarantee you that.</p>

<p>They hit some very bad scalability problems (and the MySQL problems mentioned above are related to that) which were simply caused by the fact that people used the site in a way not anticipated by the developers. Everybody knows that Twitter is a micro-messaging platform. Well, except for the Twitter founders. They had this brilliant idea for a micro content management system.</p>

<p>And so, they <em>did</em> build a micro-CMS. And of course, the central piece of a content management system, is a content repository, IOW a database. Users however used Twitter as a micro-messaging platform. And the central piece of a messaging platform is a message queue.</p>

<p>As a result, MySQL was being used as a message queue. No two things could be further apart than a database (especially a SQL database) and a message queue. The two have almost exactly opposite requirements and constraints.</p>

<p>And of course, the entire architecture was built <em>around</em> that content repository which was now being abused as a message queue.</p>

<p>In response to that, the Twitter developers wrote their own message queue in Ruby, which helped performance and scalability a lot. But not enough. So, they wrote another message queue, this time in Scala.</p>

<p>It is this single rewrite that is wholly responsible for, I would estimate, at leat 70% of all the Rails FUD out there. But, I don't know about you: when I write something that I have absolutely no idea how to write it, and then I write the exact same thing a second time, when I actually <em>do</em> know what the heck I'm doing &hellip; the second one is always better than the first. And I suspect that this is the case here, too.</p>

<p>In several interviews, the Twitter developers have pointed out that Ruby on Rails was not responsible for their scaling problems. On the contrary, only the maintainability of Ruby made it possible to do such large-scale architectural changes to <em>fix</em> their scaling problems.</p>

<p>To cut a long story short: today, Twitter is actually using Ruby on Rails for what it was intended to be used: for a web application. And they use a database for storing data and not as a message queue. And they use an actual proper message queue. The message queue and some other backend stuff is written in Scala. The frontend is written in Ruby on Rails. Some stuff is written in C.</p>

<p>And all is peachy.</p>

<p>The <em>real</em> moral of the story here is that you can substitute pretty much <em>any</em> large web app, any language, any framework into the above story and it would still be true. MySpace is one of the slowest, most unreliable websites I know, and that is a .NET site. GitHub is one of the fastest websites I know, while being the biggest hosting platform (it has over a million repositories after just over 2 years, that's more than SourceForge and Google Code combined) and it is written in Ruby on Rails for the frontend, Sinatra for the web service, Ruby for the Git interfacing and Git infrastructure, Erlang for the federation and cloud infrastructure and Node.JS for the download server.</p>

"<p>The code:</p>

<pre><code>public String getTemperatureMessage(double temp)
{
    if(temp &lt; 32)
        return ""Freezing"";
    else if(temp &lt; 60)
        return ""Brr"";
    else if(temp &lt; 80)
        return ""Comfortable"";
    else
        return ""Too hot"";
}
</code></pre>

<p>Regarding the code snippet above, the else ifs are technically superfluous and don't change the behavior at all. However, I tend to like to put them in there to emphasize that the conditions are exclusive. What are your thoughts? Unnecessary or more clear?</p>
","2988","","<p>Personally, I think the <code>else</code>s are unnecessary. Since this question is tagged as <code>[language-agnostic]</code>, I'm going to provide a couple of examples of how I would write it:</p>

<pre><code>def temperature_message(temp)
  return 'Freezing'    if temp &lt; 32
  return 'Brr'         if temp &lt; 60
  return 'Comfortable' if temp &lt; 80
  'Too hot'
end
</code></pre>

<p>This is typical guard clause style, which both I personally and the Ruby community in general use quite often.</p>

<pre><code>def temperature_message(temp)
  case
  when temp &lt; 32
    'Freezing'
  when temp &lt; 60
    'Brr'
  when temp &lt; 80
    'Comfortable'
  else
    'Too hot'
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>This is a typical <code>switch</code> as you would find it in some less powerful languages. This is probably one that I would <em>not</em> use, I would refactor it like this:</p>

<pre><code>def temperature_message(temp)
  case temp
  when (-1.0/0.0)...32
    'Freezing'
  when 32...60
    'Brr'
  when 60...80
    'Comfortable'
  else
    'Too hot'
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Although I must admit I still find the first one easiest to read.</p>

<p>Since this is basically a mapping table, I would try to format it as such, so that everybody who reads the code, immediately sees the ""table-ness"":</p>

<pre><code>def temperature_message(temp)
  case temp
  when (-1.0/0.0)...32 then 'Freezing'
  when         32...60 then 'Brr'
  when         60...80 then 'Comfortable'
                      else 'Too hot'
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>This also applies to your original Java implementation:</p>

<pre><code>public String getTemperatureMessage(double temp) {
    if(temp &lt; 32) return ""Freezing"";
    if(temp &lt; 60) return ""Brr"";
    if(temp &lt; 80) return ""Comfortable"";
    else          return ""Too hot"";
}
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, since it <em>is</em> basically a mapping table, you might just as well implement it as a map:</p>

<pre><code>def temperature_message(temp)
  {
    (-1.0/0.0)...32       =&gt; 'Freezing',
            32...60       =&gt; 'Brr',
            60...80       =&gt; 'Comfortable',
            80..(1.0/0.0) =&gt; 'Too hot'
  }.detect {|range, _| range.include?(temp) }.last
end

"<p>The name for Lisp derives from <b>LIS</b>t <b>P</b>rocessing. Linked lists are the major data structure of Lisp languages, and Lisp source code is itself made up of lists. As a result, Lisp programs can manipulate source code as a data structure (this is known as homoiconicity).</p>

<p>However, a list is by definition a sequential construct. This encourages us to solve problems using sequential language idioms (algorithms that process one thing at a time and accumulate the results). For example, in a Lisp where <em>cons</em> cells are used to implement singly-linked lists, the <em>car</em> operation returns the first element of the list, while <em>cdr</em> returns the rest of the list. My vision is of a functional language for parallel execution, that splits problems into roughly equal sub-problems, recursively solves them, and combines the sub-solutions.</p>

<p>Pretty much every programming language's code is already parsed into trees; is there a homoiconic language like Lisp, but with trees as the major data structure? btw, I'd call it Treep, for <b>TREE</b> <b>P</b>rocessing.</p>

"<p>I've been told that ruby 1.9.2 is ruby 2.0 but ruby 1.9.3 is slated to be released in the near future and it will contain some performance enhancements.</p>

<p>So what are they planning for 2.0? Will it be much different than ruby 1.9.x?</p>
","2988","","<p>Two features that are already implemented in YARV, and which will most likely end up in Ruby 2.0, are traits (<code>mix</code>) and <code>Module#prepend</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>mix</code> method, unlike the current <code>include</code> method, takes a <em>list</em> of modules, and mixes all of them in at the same time, making sure that they have no conflicting methods. It also gives you a way to easily resolve conflicts, if e.g. two modules you want to mix in define the same method. So, basically, while the <code>include</code> method allows you to treat a module as a mixin, the <code>mix</code> method allows you to treat a module as a trait.</p>

<p><code>Module#prepend</code> mixes a module into a class or module, again just like <code>include</code> does, but instead of inserting it into the inheritance chain just <em>above</em> the class, it inserts is just <em>below</em> the class. This means that methods in the module can override methods in the class, and they can delegate to the overriden methods with <code>super</code>, both of which is not possible when using <code>include</code>. This basically makes <code>alias_method_chain</code> obsolete.</p>

<p>One feature that has been discussed for a couple of months (or 10 years, depending on how you count), are Refinements. There has been discussion for over 10 years now to add a way to do scoped, safe monkey patching in Ruby. I.e. a way where I can monkey patch a core class, but only my code sees that monkey patch, other code doesn't. For many years, the frontrunner for that kind of safe monkey patching were Selector Namespaces, however more recently, Classboxes have been getting a lot of attention, and even more recently, a prototype implementation and specification of Refinements, a variant of Classboxes, was put forward.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, the big theme of Ruby 2.0 is scalability: scaling <em>up</em> to bigger teams, bigger codebases, bigger problem sizes, bigger machines, more cores. But also scaling <em>down</em> to smaller machines like embedded devices.</p>

<p>The three features I mentioned above are for scaling to bigger teams and bigger codebases. Some proposed features for scaling to bigger problem sizes and more cores are parallel collections and parallel implementations of <code>Enumerable</code> methods such as <code>map</code>, as well as better concurrency abstractions such as futures, promises, agents, actors, channels, join patterns or something like that.</p>

","2988","","<p>This has nothing to with the programming language. It's a question of the quality of the garbage collector implementation.</p>

<p>Realtime garbage collectors with predictable and tunable pause times times have been known since the 1970s. Nowadays, it gets even easier: as machines routinely have 1000s of CPUs, just set a couple dozen or so aside for the garbage collector to run on, and do the collection concurrently.</p>

<p>The Azul Jaca Compute Appliance, for example, does exactly that. It is specifically designed for very large applications with very large heaps and near-realtime requirements (e.g. automated trading systems for hedgefonds).

<p>The current version (JCA 7300) has up to 864 CPUs and 768 GiByte of RAM. Typically, the grbage collector(s) will use 20&ndash;30 CPUs, leaving well over 700 (the JIT compiler also uses a dozen or three) for the application(s). That's still way more than almost all applications can handle.</p>

<p>Tail recursion is a special case of a tail call. Direct tail recursion is a special case of tail recursion. <em>Only</em> direct tail recursion is guaranteed to be optimized. Others <em>may</em> be optimized, too, but that's basically just a compiler optimization. As a <em>language feature</em>, Scala only guarantees direct tail recursion elimination.</p>

<p>So, what's the difference?</p>

<p>Well, a tail call is simply the last call in a subroutine:</p>

<pre><code>def a = {
  b
  c
}
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, the call to <code>c</code> is a tail call, the call to <code>b</code> is not.</p>

<p>Tail <em>recursion</em> is when a tail call calls a subroutine that was already called before:</p>

<pre><code>def a = {
  b
}

def b = {
  a
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is tail recursion: <code>a</code> calls <code>b</code> (a tail call), which in turn calls <code>a</code> again. (In contrast to the direct tail recursion described below, this is sometimes called <em>indirect</em> tail recursion.)</p>

<p>However, none of the two examples will get optimized by Scala. Or, more precisely: a Scala implementation is <em>allowed</em> to optimize them, but it is not <em>required</em> to do so. This is in contrast to, e.g. Scheme, where the language specification guarantees that all of the above cases will take <code>O(1)</code> stack space.</p>

<p>The Scala Language Specification <em>only</em> guarantees that <em>direct</em> tail recursion is optimized, i.e. when a subroutine <em>directly</em> calls <em>itself</em> with no other calls in between:</p>

<pre><code>def a = {
  b
  a
}
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, the call to <code>a</code> is a tail call (because it is the last call in the subroutine), it is tail recursion (because it calls itself again) and most importantly it is <em>direct</em> tail recursion, because <code>a</code> directly calls itself without going through another call first.</p>

<p>Note that there are many subtle things that may lead to a method not being directly tail-recursive. For example, if <code>a</code> is overloaded, then the recursion may actually go through different overloads, and thus would no longer be direct.</p>

<p>In practice, this means two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>you cannot perform an Extract Method Refactoring on a tail-recursive method, at least not including the tail call, because this would turn a directly tail-recursive method (which will get optimized) into an indirectly tail-recursive method (which will not get optimized).</li>
<li>You can <em>only</em> use direct tail recursion. A tail-recursive descent parser, or a state machine, which can be very elegantly expressed using indirect tail recursion, are out.</li>
</ol>

<p>The main reason for this is that when your underlying execution engine lacks powerful control flow manipulation features such as <code>GOTO</code>, continuations, first-class mutable stack or proper tail calls, then you need to either implement your own stack on top of it, use trampolines, make a global CPS transform or something similarly nasty, in order to provide generalized proper tail calls. All of these have either severe impact on performance or interoperability with other code on the same platform.</p>

<p>Or, as Rich Hickey, the creator of Clojure, said when he was facing the same problem: ""Performance, Java interop, tail calls. Pick two."" Both Clojure and Scala chose to compromise on tail calls and provide only tail recursion and not full tail calls.</p>

<p>To cut a long story short: yes, the specific example you posted will be optimized, since it is direct tail recursion. You can test this by putting an <code>@tailrec</code> annotation on the method. The annotation does not change whether or not the method gets optimized, it <em>does</em> however guarantee that you will get a compile error if the method can <em>not</em> be optimized.</p>

<p>Due to the above-mentioned subtleties, it is generally a good idea to put an <code>@tailrec</code> annotation on methods that you need to be optimized, both in order to get a compile error, but also as a hint to other developers maintaining your code.</p>

"<p>I have a two part question:</p>

<p><strong>Part 1</strong></p>

<p>I have a module that has a public class method which depends on a few private helper methods in the module. What is the best way to test these private helper methods? They contain complex logic that needs to be tested, but they should not be exposed to be called as they alone provide nothing useful.</p>

<p>I read on <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/318850/private-module-methods-in-ruby"">this</a> stackoverflow post that the convention is to do:</p>

<pre><code>module GTranslate
  class Translator
    def perform( text ); 'hola munda'; end
  end

  def self.translate( text )
    t = Translator.new
    t.perform( text )
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>and then write tests on the public methods of class <code>GTranslate::Translator</code>. However, I do not want this class to be able to instantiate or have the methods on them called.</p>

<p><strong>Part 2</strong></p>

<p>Seeing that the public method on a module is defined as <code>self.someMethodName</code>, does this mean the helper methods have to be defined as <code>self.helperName</code>?</p>

<p>There will be no instance of a module (if you can even create instances of modules (I'm new to Ruby)) so I can't use the <code>send</code> method defined on an instance to invoke the method from my tests?</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>
","2988","","<p>There are two cases:</p>

<ol>
<li>The private method gets called by a public method, or by a private method that gets called by a public method, or by a private method that gets called by a private method that gets called by a public method, or &hellip; (you get the idea). In that case, you don't need to test the private method, because it is already tested through the public method.</li>
<li>The private method never gets called by a public method. In that case, you don't need to test it either, you can simply delete it because it never gets called.</li>
</ol>

<p>So, in both cases you simply don't need to test it in the first place.</p>

<p>(Note that it's a little bit more complicated than that, since the private method might be called via reflection or other means. But the gist is: either someone somewhere calls the private method, in which case it is tested through that someone, or noone calls the private method, in which case it is dead code.)</p>

<p>If I may make a small advertisement for Test-Driven Development: in TDD, it is actually impossible for untested private methods to exist. The only way for a private method to be introduced into the system, is by extraction from an already tested public method. (Actually, in TDD, it is impossible for <em>any</em> untested code to exist, so the statement that it is impossible for untested private methods to exist is trivially true.)</p>

<p>In general, private methods usually are created by extracting them from a public method that has become too big or too complex. The nice thing about this is that the Extract Method Refactoring has a very convenient property: like all other Refactorings, it doesn't change the externally observable behavior, but <em>unlike</em> many other Refactorings, which entail rather significant changes to the internal logic (e.g. the Null Object Refactoring or the Replace Conditional With Polymorphism Refactoring), it does <em>not</em> change the internal logic, either. It just shuffles code around. (In fact, with a good optimizing compiler like the one in Rubinius, IronRuby or JRuby, the calls to the private methods will probably be inlined, so that the code that gets actually executed is 100% the same both before and after extracting the methods.)</p>

<p>So, if your code was tested before you moved into a private method, then it is guaranteed to still be tested after you move it.</p>

","2988","","<p>Just to add a little bit more explanation: in Ruby, there is an ambiguity between variable references and message sends.</p>

<p>Could <em>either</em> mean ""dereference the variable named <code>foo</code> (or <code>Foo</code>)"" <em>or</em> ""send the message <code>:foo</code> (or <code>:Foo</code>) with an empty argument list to the default receiver"".</p>

<p>This ambiguity is resolved as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>If <code>foo</code> starts with a lower-case letter, it is assumed to be a message send, unless the parser has seen an assignment to <code>foo</code> before, in which case it is treated as a variable dereference. (Note that the assignment only needs to <em>parsed</em>, not executed; <code>if false then foo = nil end</code> is perfectly fine.)</li>
<li>If <code>Foo</code> starts with an uppercase letter, it is treated as a variable (or rather constant) dereference, unless you pass an argument list (even an empty one), in which case it is treated as a message send.</li>
</ol>

<p>In this case, <code>RuntimeError</code> is treated as a message send, because it has an argument list: <code>""must have a thing!""</code>. This is, of course, because of another of Ruby's peculiarities, namely that it allows you to leave out the parentheses around an argument list, as long it is unambiguous.</p>

<p>However, the output is:</p>

<pre><code>Example

<p>Here's my rationale:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Example</code> is an instance of <code>Class</code>, so <code>self</code> in the class body refers to that;</li>
<li><code>class &lt;&lt; obj</code> sets <code>self</code> to whatever <code>obj</code> is in the given block, which in my case is the instance of <code>Class</code> that is <code>Example</code> (this is where I'm probably wrong);</li>
<li><code>instance_eval</code> runs the block in the given instance, so, in my case it's pretty much the same as putting the code in the block directly in the class body.</li>
</ul>

<p>My current guess is that <code>class &lt;&lt; self</code> inserts a ghost class between <code>Example</code> and <code>Class</code> and sets self to that, but the output of <code>#&lt;Class:Example&gt;</code> is not confirming that at all.</p>

<p>So what is wrong with my rationale?</p>

<p>No, <code>class &lt;&lt; obj</code> opens up the <em>singleton class</em> of <code>obj</code>. As you correctly pointed out, inside of a class declaration, <code>self</code> refers to the class itself, so, in this case, the ""inner"" <code>self</code> (i.e. the one being passed to <code>puts</code>) refers to the <em>singleton class</em> of <code>Example</code>.</p>

<p>I.e. <code>return</code> inside a <code>Proc</code> behaves like <code>return</code> inside a block and argument binding for <code>Proc</code>s works the same as argument binding for blocks. <code>return</code> inside a lambda works like <code>return</code> inside a method and argument binding for lambdas works the same as argument binding for methods.</p>

<p>Note, however, that lambdas <em>are</em> <code>Proc</code>s, i.e. they are instances of the <code>Proc</code> class. The difference between them is whether <code>Proc#lambda?</code> is <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.</p>

<p>Note also that in older versions of Ruby, <code>Kernel#proc</code> created a lambda and <em>not</em> a <code>Proc</code>, which was utterly confusing. This has been fixed in modern versions of Ruby, where <code>Kernel#proc</code> is now equivalent to <code>Proc.new</code> and thus creates a <code>Proc</code>.</p>

<p><code>Kernel#lambda</code> and the lambda literal syntax (<code>-&gt;(x, y) { x + y }</code>) always create a lambda, <code>Proc.new</code> always creates a <code>Proc</code> and <code>Kernel#proc</code> depends on the Ruby version.</p>

<p>Granted, many people would find reassuring to know that an <code>if</code> is always an <code>if</code>, and an <code>else</code> is always an <code>else</code>, no matter the context.

","2988","","<p><em>Any</em> object-oriented language (or <em>any</em> language with runtime polymorphism) can implement conditionals as a library feature, since method dispatch already is a more general form of conditional anyway. Smalltalk, for example, has absolutely no conditionals whatsoever except for method dispatch.</p>

<p>There is no need for any kind of compiler magic, except maybe for syntactic convenience.</p>

<p>In Scala, it would look maybe a little bit like this:</p>

  def iffElse[T](thenn: =&gt; T)(els: =&gt; T): T
  def &amp;&amp;(other: =&gt; MyBoolean): MyBoolean

  def iffElse[T](thenn: =&gt; T)(els: =&gt; T) = els
  def &amp;&amp;(other: =&gt; MyBoolean) = MyFalse
  def ||(other: =&gt; MyBoolean) = other
  def nott = MyTrue
}

abstract class MyBoolean extends MyBooleanLike

class MyTrueClass extends MyBoolean with MyTruthiness {}
class MyFalseClass extends MyBoolean with MyFalsiness {}

object MyTrue extends MyTrueClass {}
object MyFalse extends MyFalseClass {}
</code></pre>

<p>Just add a little implicit conversion:</p>

<pre><code>object MyBoolExtension {
  implicit def boolean2MyBoolean(b: =&gt; Boolean) =
    if (b) { MyTrue } else { MyFalse }
}

import MyBoolExtension._
</code></pre>

<p>And now we can use it:</p>

<pre><code>object Main extends App {
  (2 &lt; 3) iff { println(""2 is less than 3"") }
}
</code></pre>

<p>[Note: my type-fu is rather weak. I had to cheat a little bit to get this to compile within a reasonable timeframe. Someone with a better understanding of Scala's type system may want to fix it up. Also, now that I look at it, 8 classes, traits and objects, two of them abstract, seems a little over-engineered ;-) ]</p>

<p>Of course, the same is true for pattern matching as well. Any language with pattern matching doesn't need other kinds of conditionals, since pattern matching is more general anyway.</p>

<pre><code>b = a.each.map {|i| i = 0 }

<pre><code>b = a.map {|i| i = 0 }

<p>The same questions basically apply also to your second code example. Again, you completely <em>ignore</em> the elements of <code>a</code>, so using <code>map</code> simply makes no sense whatsoever. You can just do </p>

<pre><code>(b = a.dup)[2..4] = [0] * 3

"<p>I have a gem which implements my entire business logic, so that I can use it in different applications. Now, one of these applications requires persistence. How do I easily extend my existing Ruby models to support persistence? Should I monkey patch them?</p>

<p>To give you a bit of a background, my model objects are usually just built from XML or JSON files, but now I need to store them in an relational database.</p>

<p>Are there common patterns for this problem? Should I write new model objects that support persistence and map between my legacy objects and the new model objects or should I extend the existing ones to be representable in a database?</p>

<p>Any tips, hints, and links are highly welcome.</p>
","2988","","<p>I am not sure that I fully understand your question. However, the <a href=""http://DataMapper.Org/"" rel=""nofollow"">DataMapper</a> library can be very easily used to add persistence to an already existing object model after the fact, for two reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>It doesn't rely on class inheritance (like e.g. ActiveRecord does) but on mixin inheritance, and you can inherit from as many mixins you like, which means you won't have to change the inheritance tree of your object model just to add DataMapper to it.</li>
<li>The object-relational-mapping is declared explicitly in the model, not inferred from the data-store. This means that you can have very complex mappings between the data-store and your models, unlike the rather simple 1:1 table == class, row == object, column == attribute mapping of ActiveRecord.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, whether or not you will manage to keep the persistence aspect fully orthogonal, and e.g. in a separate gem, that's another question. You <em>could</em> indeed keep it in a separate library that just opens up all the model classes and <code>include DataMapper::Resource</code> and declare all the properties. This will allow you to still deploy your object model gem without persistence, but the persistence gem will obviously be rather tightly coupled to the object model gem.</p>

","2988","","<p>Since Rubinius is the most advanced and most aggressively optimizing Ruby implementation, I <a href=""http://groups.google.com/group/rubinius-dev/browse_thread/thread/ace9e880a3dd20ac/"">asked this question</a> on the <a href=""http://groups.google.com/group/rubinius-dev/"">Rubinius mailinglist</a>, and <a href=""http://groups.google.com/group/rubinius-dev/msg/38ec3ea7e2a892de/"">here's what Evan Phoenix had to say</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your assumption that it could be the same as a block is, I'm sad to say, dead wrong. There reason you don't see <code>Method#to_proc</code> and such in profiling is 2 fold: </p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>Most (all?) MRI profilers do not show methods that MRI defines in C, so they'd never show up. </li>
  <li>The mechanism for activating a method that has been turned into a <code>Proc</code> is all in C, so the overhead is invisible on the invocation side too. </li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>Your point about the arty differences are right on. Additionally, your thinking that a VM could easily optimize it into a block is quite wrong. <code>Object#method</code> is a not something that would be detected and optimized away. Additionally, even with runtime optimizations, something like escape analysis is still required since <code>#method</code> returns a <code>Method</code> object that you'd have to see inside and extract the information from. On the invocation side, the invoked method can only do something special with the block in the case of block inlining, an optimization that only Rubinius has. </p>
  
  <p>So to get to your questions: </p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>Does Rubinius optimize this code? No. Could it? Yes, but it's hardly easy. </li>
  <li>In time it could, yes. </li>
  <li>In time it should, yes.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Note: the questions he refers to in the last paragraph are:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>Does Rubinius currently optimize such point-free code? </li>
  <li>If it doesn't, could it? </li>
  <li>If it could, should it? </li>
  </ol>

"<p>I'm just wondering what applications it has. I believe in 1.9 the prefix ? would return the string version of that character.</p>

<pre><code>?a   #=&gt; ""a""
?\t  #=&gt; ""\t""
</code></pre>

<p>Is this just  shorthand for 'a' or '\t'?</p>
","2988","","<p>It's mainly for backwards compatibility. In versions prior to 1.9, <code>?</code> evaluated to a <code>Fixnum</code> corresponding to the ASCII value of the character in question. Indexing into a <code>String</code> <em>also</em> returned a <code>Fixnum</code>.</p>

<p>So, if you wanted to check, for example, if the third character of a string was the letter 'a' you would do</p>

<pre><code>s[2] == ?a
</code></pre>

<p>In Ruby 1.9, strings are no longer treated as an array of fixnums but as an iterator of characters (single-character strings, actually). As a result, the above code would no longer work: <code>s[2]</code> would be a string, <code>?a</code> would be a number, and those two would never be equal.</p>

<p>Therefore, <code>?</code> was also changed to evaluate to a single-character string, so that the above code continues to work.</p>

<p>1st) Funnily enough, the environment doesn't seem to have changed to development even though I stated it in the code.

</blockquote>



<p>I am looking hard for <strong>formal specifications and a formal definition of the Ruby programming language</strong>. Does one exist, if so, where can I find it?</p>
","2988","","<p>There is <a href=""http://WWW.IPA.Go.Jp/osc/english/ruby/ruby_draft_specification_agreement.html"">a draft</a> for a <a href=""http://WWW.IPA.Go.Jp/osc/english/ruby/"">formal specification</a> of Ruby. It is being developed by the <a href=""http://WWW.IPA.Go.Jp/osc/english/"">Open Standards Promotion Center</a> of the <a href=""http://WWW.IPA.Go.Jp/index-e.html"">Information-Technology Promotion Agency</a> (a Japanese government agency) for submission to the <a href=""http://WWW.JISC.Go.Jp/eng/"">Japanese Industrial Standards Committee</a> and then further on to the <a href=""http://ISO.Org/"">International Organization for Standardization</a>.</p>

<p>However, nobody actually uses this specification. The specification that is <em>actually</em> being used by all the Ruby implementors like <a href=""http://Rubini.us/"">Rubinius</a>, <a href=""http://IronRuby.Net/"">IronRuby</a>, <a href=""http://JRuby.Org/"">JRuby</a>, <a href=""http://MacRuby.Org/"">MacRuby</a>, <a href=""http://MagLev.GemStone.Com/"">MagLev</a> and so on, is the <a href=""http://RubySpec.Org/"">RubySpec</a>.</p>

<p>The three main differences between the ISO Draft Specification and RubySpec are:</p>

<ol>
<li>RubySpec is <em>complete</em>: it covers the entire Ruby language, and the entire core library, from version 1.8.7 to 1.9.2 and 1.9.3. The ISO Draft Specification only covers a very small subset of the intersection of 1.8 and 1.9.</li>
<li>RubySpec is written in <em>Ruby</em> (which is a language that every Rubyist can read), the ISO Draft Specification is written in English, or rather in ISO Standardese (which is a language that only a handful of people on the planet can fully understand).</li>
<li>RubySpec is <em>executable</em>: you can just run it against your Ruby implementation to see what you are still missing.</li>
</ol>

<p>Another great source (pun intended) of information about the behavior of Ruby is the <a href=""https://GitHub.Com/Rubinius/Rubinius/tree/master/kernel/"">source code of the Rubinius kernel</a>, which implements the semantics of the Ruby language and the Ruby core library. (Note: a lot of people prefer <a href=""https://GitHub.Com/Ruby/Ruby/"">the source code</a> of <a href=""http://AtDot.Net/yarv/"">YARV</a>, but I don't, for two reasons: firstly, YARV is in C, which is a language that not every Rubyist knows, whereas Rubinius is in Ruby, which (hopefully) every Rubiyst knows, and secondly, the Rubinius codebase is much better structured, well-designed, well-organized, well-tested, well-documented.)</p>

"<p>I am trying to figure out which files I need to modify; so by that, I use sequences of grep commands. I want to find out which files contain both foo and bar. Therefore, my command is:<br/>

<p>The documentation for <a href=""http://RubyDoc.Info/stdlib/core/Module%3aappend_features""><code>Module#append_features</code></a>, in turn, describes (very briefly) how the default Ruby mixin algorithm works:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When this module is included in another, Ruby calls <code>append_features</code> in this module, passing it the receiving module in <code>mod</code>. Ruby’s default implementation is to add the constants, methods, and module variables of this module to <code>mod</code> if this module has not already been added to <code>mod</code> or one of its ancestors. See also <a href=""http://RubyDoc.Info/stdlib/core/Module%3ainclude""><code>Module#include</code></a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code># Add all constants, instance methods and module variables

<li><code>NArray</code> elements can <em>only</em> be fixed-size integers or floats</li>

"<p>I've created a ruby C extension <code>TestExt</code>, successfully compiled it, but when I try and use it in irb I can only access it's methods after i've called <code>include TestExt</code>.</p>

","2988","","<p>As you say yourself in your question, <code>hello</code> is an instance method, ergo you first need to mix your module into something, so that you <em>have</em> an instance to call it on.</p>

<pre><code>class Object
  include TestExt

<p>which mixes <code>TestExt</code> into <code>Object</code> and thus makes <code>hello</code> available as an instance method of the <code>Object</code> class. Since <em>everything</em> inherits from <code>Object</code>, including <code>Module</code>, this makes the <code>hello</code> instance method available to both your <code>TestExt</code> module and the anonymous <code>main</code> object (which is what <code>self</code> evaluates to at the top-level).</p>

"<p>I used Ruby many years ago and am back hopefully to stay. I recall from several years ago reading that odd-numbered releases of Ruby (eg. 1.9.1, 1.9.3, 1.9.5) are meant for development and that even releases (eg. 1.9.2, 1.9.4) are meant to be production stable. Is this (still) the case or is the latest ""stable"" as per the Ruby website the way to go?</p>

<p>I've never developed a project as grand as Ruby so I don't know if there are rules for releases that should be followed. Any enlightenment on this topic would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
","2988","","<p>Yes, it is in fact true that odd-numbered releases <em>were</em> unstable in the past. (However, note that ""odd-numbered"" refers to the <em>minor</em> number, not the <em>tiny</em> number, i.e. 1.1.x, 1.3.x, 1.5.x and 1.7.x were unstable development releases.)</p>

<p>This was changed with Ruby 1.9 for a very simple (and very embarassing) reason: there are <em>tons</em> of Ruby scripts as well as shell scripts (including the scripts that the Ruby maintainers <em>themselves</em> use to automate the development, testing and releasing of Ruby) out there, which simply assume that the major version is a single digit. They would simply <em>break</em> otherwise, mostly because they did things like</p>

<pre><code>if RUBY_VERSION &gt; '1.6.3'
</code></pre>

<p>which <em>fails</em> for <code>'1.10.0'</code>, because the <em>string</em> <code>'1.10.0'</code> is lexicograhically <em>smaller</em> than the <em>string</em> <code>'1.6.3'</code>.</p>

<p>As a result, it was decided to give up the distinction between odd-numbered and even-numbered releases, and make the next stable release 1.9, because that was easier than convincing everybody that their scripts are broken.</p>

<p>So, the 1.9.0-x series of releases corresponds to 1.9.x under the <em>old</em> numbering scheme (i.e. a series of development releases in preparation of the next release) and the 1.9.(x > 0) series of releases corresponds to 1.10.(x-1), i.e. 1.9.2 is really 1.10.1. (Well, except that 1.9.1 was a botched release, so it is more like a 1.10.0-pre and 1.9.2 is 1.10.0 and 1.9.3 is 1.10.1.)</p>

<p>Also, Ruby 2.0 is intended to be fully backwards-compatible, which means that it's really 1.12 ... does that clear up any confusion? :-)</p>

<p>So, in summary: Yes, it <em>used</em> to be true (but in a different way than you thought), but it is <em>no longer</em> true, and hasn't been true since the 1.7 series which ended with the release of Ruby 1.8.0 in August of 2003, over <em>eight years</em> ago.</p>

<p>No, JavaScript doesn't have classes. It is pretty easy to implement them, though, if your design needs them.

"<p>Very much an idle day-dream this but is it possible with some neat meta-programming trick to define a new logical operator in Ruby? I'd like to define a <code>but</code> operator.</p>

<p>It doesn't. It <code>yield</code>s a <em>single</em> object to its block, which is a two-element array consisting of the key and the value.</p>

<p>It's just destructuring bind:</p>

<pre><code>def without_destructuring(a, b) end
without_destructuring([1, 2])
# ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (1 for 2)

def with_destructuring((a, b)) end # Note the extra parentheses
with_destructuring([1, 2])

def with_nested_destructuring((a, (b, c))) p a; p b; p c end
with_nested_destructuring([1, [2, 3]])
# 1
# 2
# 3

# Note the similarity to
a, (b, c) = [1, [2, 3]]
</code></pre>

<p>Theoretically, you would have to call <code>map</code> like this:</p>

<pre><code>hsh.map {|(k, v)| ... }
</code></pre>

<p>And, in fact, for <code>inject</code>, you actually <em>need</em> to do that:</p>

<pre><code>hsh.inject {|acc, (k, v)| ... }
</code></pre>

<p>However, Ruby is more lenient with argument checking for blocks than it is for methods. In particular:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you <code>yield</code> more than one object, but the block only takes a single argument, all the objects are collected into an array.</li>
<li>If you <code>yield</code> a single object, but the block takes multiple arguments, Ruby performs destructuring bind. (This is the case here.)</li>
<li>If you <code>yield</code> more objects than the block takes arguments, the extra objects get ignored.</li>
<li>If you the block takes more arguments than you are <code>yield</code>ing, the extra arguments are bound to <code>nil</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Basically, the same semantics as parallel assignment.</p>

<p>In fact, before Ruby 1.9, block arguments actually <em>did have</em> assignment semantics. This allowed you to do crazy things like this:</p>

<pre><code>class &lt;&lt; (a = Object.new); attr_accessor :b end

def wtf; yield 1, 2 end

wtf {|@a, a.b| } # WTF? The block body is empty!

p @a
# 1
p a.b
# 2
</code></pre>

<p>This crazy stuff works (in 1.8 and older), because block argument passing is treated the same as assignment. IOW, even though the above block is empty and doesn't do <em>anything</em>, the fact that block arguments are passed as if they had been assigned, means that <code>@a</code> is set and the <code>a.b=</code> setter method is called. Crazy, huh? That's why it was removed in 1.9.</p>

<p>If you want to startle your co-workers, stop defining your setters like this:</p>

<pre><code>attr_writer :foo
</code></pre>

<p>and instead define them like this:</p>

<pre><code>define_method(:foo=) {|@foo|}

","2988","","<p>In your question, you say that you want an array of functions. But there isn't a single function in your entire code snippet!</p>

<p>I'm guessing by the names <code>f1</code>, <code>f2</code> and <code>f3</code> that you thought those were functions. But they aren't: the <code>def</code> keyword is used to declare <em>methods</em>, not <em>functions</em>. Those two are <em>fundamentally different</em>!</p>

<p>So, if you want to use an array of functions, just make <code>f1</code>, <code>f2</code> and <code>f3</code> actually <em>be</em> functions instead of methods:</p>

<pre><code>val f1: (Int, Int) =&gt; Int = _ + _
val f2: (Int, Int) =&gt; Int = _ - _
val f3: (Int, Int) =&gt; Int = _ * _

<p>An alternative to that would be to actually <em>read</em> the error message, which tells you <em>exactly</em> what the problem is and how to fix it:</p>

<pre><code>error: missing arguments for method f1 in object $iw;
follow this method with `_' if you want to treat it as a partially applied function
          val fnList = Array(f1,f2,f3)
                             ^

<p>So, if you simply do what the error message tells you to do, namely convert the methods to functions using the <code>_</code> operator, everything will work fine:</p>

<pre><code>val fnList = Array(f1 _, f2 _, f3 _)
</code></pre>

<p>The reason why you are getting the error message is simply because Scala allows you to leave off the parentheses in a method call. So, <code>f1</code> just means ""call <code>f1</code> without an argument list"", which is an error, because <code>f1</code> takes two arguments.</p>

<p>In some cases, when it is <em>really</em> painfully blatantly obvious that the argument cannot <em>possibly</em> be anything <em>but</em> a function, Scala will perform the conversion from method to function for you automatically. So, a third option would be to <em>make</em> it painfully blatantly obvious to Scala that you <em>do</em> have an array of functions, by, you know, declaring it as an array of functions:</p>

<pre><code>val fnList: Array[(Int, Int) =&gt; Int] = Array(f1, f2, f3) // or
val fnList = Array[(Int, Int) =&gt; Int](f1, f2, f3)

Aptana RadRails 2 seemed much better for refactoring ruby code, but it lacks other nice features that the newer Aptana Studio 3 offers. Since Aptana Studio 3 seems to be RadRails' successor I would expect that it has at least the same refactorings as the older RadRails 2, but it does not. Using an old unmaintained IDE does not seem a good option. Receiving updates for the IDE should still be possible.</p>

<p>I've read that <a href=""http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/index.html"">Jetbrains RubyMine 3</a> has decent ruby refactoring capabilities, but it costs money. I am rather looking for a free one. Netbeans 7 seems not to support Ruby on Rails anymore.</p>

I have to say that this combination is much better than Aptana RadRails 2 or Aptana Studio 3 for developing Ruby on Rails apps. The integration of css and html for views is well done and the integration of rails tests into the JUnit Netbeans view comes in handy.</p>

<p>However, the refactoring support seems to be too basic. It supports rename, move, copy and safely delete of methods. It does not support to select lines of code and extract a method out of it nor the similar behaviour for extracting variables.</p>

<h2>Update: RubyMine 3</h2>

<p>dynex <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/8705347/689801"">suggested</a> to use RubyMine. I've just played around with it and think its suitability as an Ruby on Rails IDE is at least as good as Netbeans'. The refactor capabilities are by far the best I've seen in a Ruby on Rails IDE so far. </p>

<p>From what I've discovered it features renaming, moving, copying, safe deletion, method extractation, variable introduction, constant introduction, field introduction, parameter introduction, inlining, pulling members up, pushing members doen, module extraction and superclass extraction.</p>

<p>My conclusion is that from the set of IDEs I tested RubyMine was the only one with decent refactoring capabilities. RubyMine costs money, but it seems worth it. The free ones cannot compete regarding refactorings.</p>

<p>Thanks for all answers and comments.</p>

<p>That's not true. Quite the opposite actually. Yes, Oracle dropped support for the Ruby on Rails plugin and gave maintenance over to the Ruby community. But the plugin is still available from the same place it was before, the community is still using the same infrastructure to develop, maintain and distribute the plugin as before. And since most of the people who originally wrote the plugin work for Google now, they can now again work on the code, now that it is no longer owned by the company that is suing their employer.</p>

"<p>This is best explained with an example:</p>

<p>file1.rb:</p>

<pre><code>def foo
  puts 123
end
</code></pre>

<p>file2.rb:</p>

<pre><code>class A
  require 'file1'
end
A.new.foo
</code></pre>

<p>will give an error ""': private method 'foo' called"". </p>

<p>I can get around this by doing <code>A.new.send(""foo"")</code> but is there a way to make the imported methods public?</p>

<p>Edit: To clarify, I am not confusing include and require. Also, the reason why I cannot use normal inclusion (as many have rightly pointed out) is that this is part of a meta-programming setup. I need to allow the user to add functionality at run-time; eg he can say ""run-this-app --include file1.rb"" and the app will behave differently based on the code he wrote in file1.rb. Sorry should have explained clearer.</p>

<p>Edit: After reading Jorg's answer I realized my code does not behave exactly as intended, and he answers my (misguided) question perfectly. I am trying to do something more akin to <code>str=(entire file1.rb as string); A.class_exec(str)</code>.</p>
","2988","","<p>Global procedures in Ruby aren't <em>really</em> global procedures. They are methods, like everything else. In particular, when you define what <em>looks like</em> a global procedure, you are <em>actually</em> defining a private instance method of <code>Object</code>. Since every piece of code in Ruby is evaluated in the context of an object, this allows you to use those methods as if they were global procedures, since <code>self</code> is the default receiver, and <code>self</code> is an object whose class inherits from <code>Object</code>.</p>

<p>So, this:</p>

<pre><code># file1.rb

def foo
  puts 123
end
</code></pre>

<p>is actually equivalent to </p>

<pre><code># file1.rb

class Object
  private

  def foo
    puts 123
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Now you have a ""global procedure"" called <code>foo</code>, which you can call just like this:</p>

<pre><code>foo
</code></pre>

<p>The <em>reason</em> why you can call it like this, is that this call is actually equivalent to </p>

<pre><code>self.foo
</code></pre>

<p>and <code>self</code> is an object that includes <code>Object</code> in its ancestry chain, thus it inherits the private <code>foo</code> method.</p>

<p>[Note: to be precise, private methods cannot be called with an explicit receiver, <em>even if</em> that explicit receiver is <code>self</code>. So, to be really pedantic, it is <em>actually</em> equivalent to <code>self.send(:foo)</code> and not <code>self.foo</code>.]</p>

<p>The <code>A.new.foo</code> in your <code>file2.rb</code> is a red herring: you could just as well try <code>Object.new.foo</code> or <code>[].foo</code> or <code>42.foo</code> and get the same result.</p>

<p>By the way: <code>puts</code> and <code>require</code> are themselves examples of such ""global procedures"", which are actually private methods on <code>Object</code> (or more precisely, they are private methods on <code>Kernel</code> which is mixed into <code>Object</code>).</p>

<p>On a sidenote: it is <em>really</em> bad style to put calls to <code>require</code> inside a class definition, because it makes it look like the <code>require</code>d code is somehow scoped or namespaced inside the class, which is of course false. <code>require</code> simply runs the code in the file, nothing more.</p>

<p>So, while </p>

<pre><code># file2.rb

class A
  require 'file1.rb'
end
</code></pre>

<p>is perfectly valid code, it is also very confusing. It is much better to use the following, semantically equivalent, code:</p>

<pre><code># file2.rb

require 'file1.rb'

class A
end
</code></pre>

<p>That way it is perfectly clear to the reader of the code that <code>file1.rb</code> is in no way scoped or namespaced inside <code>A</code>.</p>

<p>Also, it is generally preferred to leave off the file extension, i.e. to use <code>require 'file1'</code> instead of <code>require 'file1.rb'</code>. This allows you to replace the Ruby file with, for example, native code (for MRI, YARV, Rubinius, MacRuby or JRuby), JVM byte code in a <code>.jar</code> or <code>.class</code> file (for JRuby), CIL byte code in <code>.dll</code> file (for IronRuby) and so on, without having to change any of your <code>require</code> calls.</p>

<p>One last comment: the idiomatic way to circumvent access protection is to use <code>send</code>, not <code>instance_eval</code>, i.e. use <code>A.new.send(:foo)</code> instead of <code>A.new.instance_eval {foo}</code>.</p>

"<p>OK, Ruby gurus, this is a hard one to describe in the title, so bear with me for this explanation:</p>

<p>I'm looking to pass a string that represents a variable: not an instance, not the collection of properties that make up an object, but the actual variable: the <em>handle</em> to the object. </p>

<p>The reason for this is that I am dealing with resources that can be located on the filesystem, on the network, or in-memory. I want to create URI handler that can handle each of these in a consistent manner, so I can have schemes like eg.</p>

<ul>
<li>file://</li>
<li>http://</li>
<li>ftp://</li>
<li>inmemory://</li>
</ul>

<p>you get the idea. It's the last one that I'm trying to figure out: is there some way to get a string representation of a reference to an object in Ruby, and then use that string to create a new reference? I'm truly interested in marshalling the <em>reference</em>, not the <em>object</em>. Ideally there would be something like taking <code>Object#object_id</code>, which is easy enough to get, and using it to create a new variable elsewhere that refers to the same object. I'm aware that this could be really fragile and so is an unusual use case: it only works within one Ruby process for as long as there is an existing variable to keep the object from being garbage collected, but those are both true for the <code>inmemory</code> scheme I'm developing.</p>

<p>The only alternatives I can think of are:</p>

<ul>
<li>marshal the whole object and cram it into the URI, but that won't work because the data in the object is an image buffer - very large</li>
<li>Create a global or singleton purgatory area to store a variable for retrieval later using e.g. a hash of object_id:variable pairs. This is a bit smelly, but would work.</li>
</ul>

"<p>Instead of supporting method overloading Ruby overwrites existing methods. Can anyone explain why the language was designed this way?</p>
","2988","","<p>""Overloading"" is a term that simply doesn't even make sense in Ruby. It is basically a synonym for ""static argument-based dispatch"", but Ruby doesn't <em>have</em> static dispatch <em>at all</em>. So, the reason why Ruby doesn't support static dispatch based on the arguments, is because it doesn't support static dispatch, period. It doesn't support static dispatch of <em>any kind</em>, whether argument-based or otherwise.</p>

<p>Now, if you are <em>not</em> actually specifically asking about overloading, but maybe about <em>dynamic</em> argument-based dispatch, then the answer is: because Matz didn't implement it. Because nobody else bothered to propose it. Because nobody else bothered to implement it.</p>

<p>In general, dynamic argument-based dispatch in a language with optional arguments and variable-length argument lists, is <em>very</em> hard to get right, and even <em>harder</em> to keep it understandable. Even in languages with <em>static</em> argument-based dispatch and without optional arguments (like Java, for example), it is sometimes almost impossible to tell for a mere mortal, <em>which</em> overload is going to be picked. </p>

<p>In C#, you can actually encode <em>any</em> 3-SAT problem into overload resolution, which means that overload resolution in C# is NP-hard.</p>

<p>Now try that with <em>dynamic</em> dispatch, where you have the additional time dimension to keep in your head.</p>

<p>There are languages which dynamically dispatch based on all arguments of a procedure, as opposed to object-oriented languages, which only dispatch on the ""hidden"" zeroth <code>self</code> argument. Common Lisp, for example, dispatches on the dynamic types and even the dynamic values of all arguments. Clojure dispatches on an arbitrary function of all arguments (which BTW is extremely cool and extremely powerful).</p>

<p>But I don't know of any OO language with dynamic argument-based dispatch. Martin Odersky said that he <em>might</em> consider adding argument-based dispatch to Scala, but <em>only</em> if he can remove overloading at the same time <em>and</em> be backwards-compatible both with existing Scala code that uses overloading and compatible with Java (he especially mentioned Swing and AWT which play some extremely complex tricks exercising pretty much every nasty dark corner case of Java's rather complex overloading rules).

"<p>I like method parameters enclosed in parenthesis, this is some Pascal nostalgia. When cleaning up code, if I find a method parameters without it I enclose them immediately.

","2988","","<p>Parentheses are used for expression grouping and precedence override in Ruby. So, when you say</p>

<pre><code>foo (bar, baz)
</code></pre>

<p>You are sending the message <code>:foo</code> with a single argument which is the result of evaluating the expression <code>bar, baz</code>. And <code>bar, baz</code> is not a valid expression, therefore you get a <code>SyntaxError</code>.</p>

<pre><code>foo (bar)
</code></pre>

<p>works, because <code>bar</code> is a valid expression.</p>

<pre><code>foo (if bar then baz else quux end)
</code></pre>

<p>would work, too.</p>

<p>If you want Ruby to interpret parentheses not for expression grouping but for passing multiple arguments along with a message send, the opening parenthesis needs to directly follow the message selector:</p>

<pre><code>foo(bar, baz)
</code></pre>

<p>This has nothing to do with <code>Kernel#raise</code>, BTW. You cannot change the syntax for message sends in Ruby (in fact, you cannot change <em>any</em> syntax in Ruby), therefore whatever is true for <code>Kernel#raise</code> must also be true for every other method.</p>

<p>However, I also follow the following exception to the rule:</p>

  <p>use double quotes if they make the code more readable</p>

<p>Are those features language-specific though or more at the architecture level? more specifically, can't you just implement the same actor model in almost any language, and just use some form of message-queue to pass messages between worker processes?

<p>There is no such thing as a <em>constructor</em> in Ruby. Constructors are unnecessary in a well-designed language. In Ruby, there are only methods and <em>of course</em> methods can return values.</p>

","2988","","<blockquote>
  <p>how do this work</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Easy: it doesn't. Not in Ruby, anyway.</p>

<p>Just like in most other languages, there are some core entities that are simply assumed to exist. They fall from the sky, materialize out of thin air, magically appear.</p>

<p>In Ruby, some of those magic things are:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Object</code> doesn't have a superclass, but you cannot define a class with no superclass, the implicit direct superclass is always <code>Object</code>. [Note: there may be implementation-defined superclasses of <code>Object</code>, but eventually, there will be one which doesn't have a superclass.]</li>
<li><code>Object</code> is an instance of <code>Class</code>, which is a subclass of <code>Object</code> (which means that indirectly <code>Object</code> is an instance of <code>Object</code> itself)</li>
<li><code>Class</code> is a subclass of <code>Module</code>, which is an instance of <code>Class</code></li>
<li><code>Class</code> is an instance of <code>Class</code></li>
</ul>

<p>None of these things can be explained in Ruby.</p>

<p><code>BasicObject</code>, <code>Object</code>, <code>Module</code> and <code>Class</code> all need to spring into existence at the same time because they have circular dependencies.</p>

<p>Once they <em>do</em> exist, however, it is perfectly possible to implement most of their behavior in plain Ruby. You only need very barebones versions of those classes, thanks to Ruby's open classes, you can add any missing functionality at a later time.</p>

<p>In your example, the <code>class Class</code> is not creating a new class named <code>Class</code>, it is reopening the <em>existing</em> class <code>Class</code>, which was given to us by the runtime environment.</p>

<p>So, it is perfectly possible to explain the default behavior of <code>Class#new</code> in plain Ruby:</p>

<pre><code>class Class
  def new(*args, &amp;block)
    obj = allocate # another magic thing that cannot be explained in Ruby
    obj.initialize(*args, &amp;block)
    return obj
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>[Note: actually, <code>initialize</code> is private, so you need to use <code>obj.send(:initialize, *args, &amp;block)</code> to circumvent the access restriction.]</p>

<p>BTW: <code>Class#allocate</code> is another one of those magic things. It allocates a new empty object in Ruby's object space, which is something that cannot be done in Ruby. So, <code>Class#allocate</code> is something that has to be provided by the runtime system as well.</p>

"<p>A while back I bought a 1TB USB external drive. I formatted it ext4 in Ubuntu and copied a bunch of files / folders to it from several machines, all to /home/machinename/whatever, respectively.</p>

<p>At some point I ran a chmod -R shell command on it to change the permissions. That was months ago and I don't remember what I typed but it made the drive so I could only access its /home folder as root. This wasn't a problem because I could still access everything, but today I decided to try to fix it.</p>

<p>I went to my shell as root, went to that drive and typed:</p>

<pre><code>chown -R rick:rick ./
chmod -R 666 ./

<p>It seemed to work.  That home directory and everything else in it now shows up as rw for each:</p>

Is there a better way to do this?</p>
","2988","","<p>Just because Ruby is dynamically and implicitly typed doesn't mean that you don't have to think about types.</p>

<p>The type of <code>Enumerable#inject</code> without an explicit accumulator (this is usually called <code>reduce</code>) is something like</p>

<pre><code>reduce :: [a] → (a → a → a) → a
</code></pre>

<p>or in a more Rubyish notation I just made up</p>

<pre><code>Enumerable[A]#inject {|A, A| A } → A
</code></pre>

<p>You will notice that all the types are the same. The element type of the <code>Enumerable</code>, the two argument types of the block, the return type of the block and the return type of the overall method.</p>

<p>The type of <code>Enumerable#inject</code> <em>with</em> an explicit accumulator (this is usually called <code>fold</code>) is something like</p>

<pre><code>fold :: [b] → a → (a → b → a) → a
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>Enumerable[B]#inject(A) {|A, B| A } → A
</code></pre>

<p>Here you see that the accumulator can have a <em>different</em> type than the element type of the collection.</p>

<p>These two rules generally get you through all <code>Enumerable#inject</code>-related type problems:</p>

<ol>
<li>the type of the accumulator and the return type of the block must be the same</li>
<li>when not passing an explicit accumulator, the type of the accumulator is the same as the element type</li>
</ol>

<p>In this case, it is Rule #1 that bites you. When you do something like</p>

<pre><code>acc[key] = value
</code></pre>

<p>in your block, assignments evaluate to the assigned value, not the receiver of the assignment. You'll have to replace this with</p>

<pre><code>acc.tap { acc[key] = value }
</code></pre>

<p>Note: there's an exception to this rule. Private setters <em>can</em> be called with an explicit receiver, as long as the receiver is <code>self</code>.

","2988","","<p>Well, 1, 2, and 5 aren't functions <em>at all</em>, they are <em>methods</em>, which are fundamentally different from functions: methods <em>belong to</em> objects and are not themselves objects, whereas functions <em>are</em> objects.</p>

<p>1, 2, and 5 are also exactly the same: if you have only one statement, then you don't need curly braces to group several statements, ergo 5 is the same as 1. Leaving off the <code>=</code> sign is syntactic sugar for declaring a return type of <code>Unit</code>, but <code>Unit</code> is also the inferred return type for 1 and 5, so 2 is the same as 1 and 5.</p>

<p>3 is a method which, when called, returns a function. 4 is a variable which points to a function.</p>

","2988","","<p>The main problem with this is that it ties your application to the JVM. The Java community works very hard on keeping the JLS and the JVMS separate, so that Java <em>could theoretically</em> be used without the JVM, and there are two fairly widespread platforms where Java <em>is actually</em> used without the JVM: Android and GWT. If you don't expect to ever need to run on a platform that doesn't understand Java byte code, then you are fine.</p>

<p>Note that <em>static</em> byte code manipulation stuff is perfectly okay. You can cross compile JVM byte code to Dalvik byte code <em>after</em> manipulating it. But if you wanted to do that at runtime, you would have to include the JVM-to-Dalvik cross compiler in your application … and it <em>still</em> wouldn't work because the Dalvik VM simply doesn't support dynamic byte code loading the same way the JVM does.</p>

"<p>I am testing a piece of Rails code that reads:</p>

<p>I am an absolute beginner in Scala and after reading in one of the Scala books that apply function is like ""overloaded () operator"" I began to wonder how tha is defined.

Is definition of such operator possible in Scala and if so, what is the definition syntax? Thanks.</p>
","2988","","<p>As you already stated in your question, you simply define it by defining a method (<em>not</em> a function) called <code>apply</code>.</p>

<pre><code>foo.apply(bar, baz)
</code></pre>

<p>So, as long as <code>foo</code> has an <code>apply</code> method of correct arity and type, this will work.</p>

<p>Some examples of implementations of the <code>apply</code> method are the <code>Array</code> companion object, which allows you to construct an array by calling <code>Array(1, 2, 3)</code> (which is actually just <code>Array.apply(1, 2, 3)</code>) and the <code>Array</code> class, which allows you to access an array element by calling <code>anArray(i)</code> (which is actually just <code>anArray.apply(i)</code>).</p>

<p>This is similar to e.g. Python, where function calls get translated into calls to the <code>__call__</code> operator or Ruby, where an expression of the form <code>foo.(bar, baz)</code> gets translated to <code>foo.call(bar, baz)</code>.</p>

<p>A similar method is <code>update</code>:</p>

So, what is the difference between: <strong>instance variables</strong>, <strong>class variables</strong> and <strong>class instance variables</strong>? What kind of variables are inheritable and what are not?</p>
","2988","","<p>An <em>instance variable</em> is, well, a variable that belongs to <em>one</em> specific object (aka instance). Inheritance is irrelevant in this case, since objects can't inherit from anything, only classes can.</p>

<p><em>Class instance variables</em> don't exist. Classes are objects just like any other, so they can have instance variables just like any other object. When a class has an instance variable, this is sometimes called a class instance variable, but it's just an instance variable. So, again, it can't be inherited.</p>

<p><em>Class variables</em> are strange beasts. They are shared among </p>

"<p>I'm wondering what is the formal name of process of using multiple languages together.
Lets say I'm writing a program in C++ which calls Java functions (and uses Java libraries) and sometimes calls Python functions. Then it gathers the results from those calls and continues execution.</p>

<p>How would you name this process?</p>
","2988","","<p>Depending on how many different languages you use, how small the subproblems are for which you use different languages, how specific those languages are for the subproblem at hand, and how many of those languages you designed yourself to solve that specific subproblem, it might be called <em>Language-Oriented Programming</em>, <em>Polyglot Programming</em> or just <em>Programming</em>.</p>

<p>For example, just using C++ you actually use three languages: C++ itself, the C++ template language (which is basically a hybrid functional / logic programming language) and the C++ macro language. Throw in <code>make</code> and <code>sh</code> for building, JSON for configuration, <code>roff</code> for documenting, and Tcl for testing, and you are looking at 8 languages. However, I would just call that normal <em>Programming</em>, nothing special about it. The same applies to a typical web project combining HTML, CSS, ECMAScript, JSON, SQL, Java, XML, <code>sh</code>.</p>

<p><em>Language-Oriented Programming</em> is at the other end of the spectrum. In LOP, you break your problem apart into ever smaller subproblems, sub-subproblems and so on, and then you solve every subproblem with a language that is most suited for that particular subproblem, possibly one you designed specifically for that subproblem. Basically, in LOP, you use <em>Languages</em> the same way you use <em>Objects</em> in OOP, <em>Procedures</em> in PP, <em>Functions</em> in FP and so on. Typically, those languages are <em>Domain-Specific</em> and often not Turing-complete.</p>

<p><em>Polyglot Programming</em> is somewhere in the middle: you use different languages for different larger components, but not a the same level of abstraction as, say, individual objects, and you usually use pre-existing Turing-complete general-purpose languages, instead of designing them yourself. For example, trend.ly used ""Smalltalk for thinking, Java for brute-force computing, ECMAScript for visualizing, Ruby for gluing those three together and <code>sh</code> for deployment"". Your description sounds most like <em>Polyglot Programming</em> to me.</p>

<p>Note that those definitions are very subjective: for example, in Lisp, designing and implementing new languages is <em>so</em> obvious, natural and trivial, that no Lisp programmer would call what he does ""Language-Oriented Programming"". They just call it ""Programming"".</p>

<p>I wouldn't put a hard and fast rule on it, saying ""between 5 and 10 languages it's Polyglot, more is Language-Oriented, less is just Programming"". It's more a mindset: when you look at a problem, what's the first thing that comes to mind ""How can I solve this in this language"", ""What would be the best language to solve this in"" or ""What would the perfect language to solve this problem in look like""?</p>

<li><p>You don't state which implementation of Ruby you are using, but <code>ruby-prof</code> is a Ruby profiler. It profiles Ruby code. There is no Ruby implementation I know of where <code>Fixnum#*</code> is Ruby code. In MRI, YARV, MRuby and tinyrb it is C code, in Rubinius it is C++ code, in MacRuby it is Objective-C code, in JRuby and XRuby it is Java code, in RubyGoLightly it is Go code, in IronRuby and Ruby.NET it is C# code, in MagLev and SmallRuby it is Smalltalk code, in Cardinal it is PASM code. <code>ruby-prof</code> can profile Ruby code, it cannot profile C, C++, Objective-C, Java, C#, Go, Smalltalk or PASM. Only Ruby. Therefore, it simply <em>cannot</em> profile <code>Fixnum#*</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>There is no need for <code>Fixnum#*</code> to check the class more than once. It knows that <code>self</code> is a <code>Fixnum</code>, because otherwise the call wouldn't have dispatched to the <code>Fixnum#*</code> method in the first place, so it only needs to check the argument. It also needs to check whether the result will fit into a <code>Fixnum</code> or not, but it would do that internally, not by a call to <code>kind_of?</code> (in fact, that doesn't even make sense: in order to be able to call a method on the result of the multiplication, it would first have to construct the result object, and in order to construct the result object, it would already have to know whether it fits into a <code>Fixnum</code> or not).</p></li>
<li><p>It wouldn't do that class check by calling <code>kind_of?</code> and going through the entire Ruby method lookup and method dispatch machinery. It's an internal function of the Ruby implementation, it has access to all private internal implementation details, it would just check the class directly or call some internal interpreter function, not the Ruby method <code>kind_of?</code></p></li>

<p><strong>[edit]</strong></p>

<p>Took a while, but I found the answer. </p>

<p>It was a 32/64-bit issue. for ruby as a 32bit application, ""C:\Windows\System32"" is actually ""C:\Windows\SysWOW64"". As the 64bit WinExplorer showed, python27.dll was in System32 (which only 64bit processes see - well, confusing), wheras it should have been in SysWOW64 for ruby to see. Installing the 32bit version of Python fixed the problem for me (as I couldn't change the ruby script, because it was part of rubypython).</p>
","2988","","<p>In Windows 7 (Vista, actually), a lot of security policies that existed only on paper in earlier versions of Windows, are now actually enforced by the operating system. For example, according to Microsoft's documentation, it has been pretty much illegal to write to <code>C:\Windows\System32</code> for decades now, but if you actually tried it, it still worked. Not anymore. As of Vista, <code>C:\Windows\System32</code> is off-limits.</p>

<p>However, in order not to break existing (broken) applications, Microsoft introduced filesystem virtualization. If an application tries to write to <code>C:\Windows\System32</code>, it gets silently redirected to <code>C:\Users\%Username%\AppData\Local\VirtualStore\Windows\System32</code>. So, this specific application sees all the files it created or changed in <code>C:\Windows\System32</code>, but <em>other</em> applications see only the unchanged / empty directory.</p>

<p>This does not just apply to <code>C:\Windows\System32</code> but also to other system directories as well. Also, it applies to system parts of the registry, like <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</code> for example.</p>

<p>This virtualization is per-application. I.e. if Application A tries to create or modify a file in a protected directory, Windows will intercept that call and redirect it to the VirtualStore. It will also record this redirection somewhere. Now, when that same application A tries to look there again, Windows will use the recorded redirection, so that the application <em>thinks</em> the file is where it put it, when in fact, it is somewhere else entirely.</p>

<p>However, if a <em>different</em> Application B looks at that directory, then the redirection is not triggered and B just sees a pristine system directory. This is the whole point: in the past, different applications would create all sorts of weird bugs by overwriting each other's files in system directories. I.e. one application would dump its <code>python27.dll</code> into <code>C:\Windows\System32</code> and another application would dump <em>its</em> own, slightly different incompatible version of <code>python27.dll</code>, overwriting the first one.</p>

<p>So, you used <em>one</em> application to copy the DLL there (probably <code>explorer.exe</code>) and you use a <em>different</em> application, namely <code>ruby.exe</code> to look at it. But <code>explorer.exe</code> didnt't <em>actually</em> copy it into <code>system32</code>, it got redirected to the VirtualStore. When you use <code>explorer.exe</code>, the redirection gets triggered and you see the file right where you <em>think</em> you put it, but when you use <code>ruby.exe</code>, the redirection does <em>not</em> get triggered and it sees the directory as it actually is.</p>

<p>I <em>bet</em> that </p>

<pre><code>File.exists? ""C:/Users/#{ENV['Username']}/AppData/Local/VirtualStore/Windows/System32/python27.dll""

<p>returns <code>true</code>.</p>

"<p>I would like to extend the functionality of variables in Ruby. The reason is I am working on something similar of a type system or value checker (this sounds a bit crazy but the whole idea is to long to explain, just the reason I would like to extend default variables).</p>

<p>I have read that in Ruby, everything is an object; so variables are objects. And Ruby is supposed to be quite liberal concerning what can be changed via meta-programming.</p>

<p>Is there some kind of 'Class' associated with local variables that I could extend? </p>

<p>I would like to associate a string-variable for each variable that holds a string representation of a type. Further I would like to intercept variable assignments and execute a method each time a new value is assigned to a variable. This is so I can check, if the new value is correct according to the type (stored as string in the Variable).</p>

<p>If local variables in Ruby are defined as object of a class, I can extend that class or modify it via a ruby mixin.</p>

<p>The workaround would be to create a new class for my Variables (and not use the build in local variables of Ruby). This class can have a value attribute, a attribute (stored as string) for the type and a get- and set-method. This way I can solve my problem, but I would like to extend the built in variables in ruby, if that is possible.</p>

But this would require something similar to Aspect Oriented Programming and I am not sure if this can be solved with Ruby's meta-programming facilitates. </p>
","2988","","<blockquote>
  <p>I have read that in Ruby, everything is an object</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That depends on your definition of ""<em>object</em>"" and every-""<em>thing</em>"". ""<em>Object</em>"" can mean ""<em>entity that can be manipulated by the program</em>"" (which I will call <strong>object</strong> from now on), or ""<em>value that is a member of the object system</em>"" (which I will call <code>Object</code> from now on).</p>

<p>In Ruby, everything that can be manipulated by the program (i.e. every <strong>object</strong>) is also an <code>Object</code>, i.e. an instance of a class. This is unlike Java, for example, where <em>primitives</em> can be manipulated by the program (i.e. are <strong>objects</strong> in that sense of the word), but aren't <code>Objects</code>. In Ruby, this distinction doesn't exist: every <strong>object</strong> is an <code>Object</code> and every <code>Object</code> is also an <strong>object</strong>.</p>

<p>However, there are <em>things</em> in the language, which <em>cannot</em> be manipulated by the program and which aren't instances of a class, i.e. they are neither <strong>object</strong> s nor <code>Object</code>s. These are, for example, methods, variables, syntax, parameter lists, arguments lists, keywords.</p>

<p>Note: you can use Ruby's reflection API to give you an object that <em>represents</em> a method or a parameter list, but that object is only a proxy, it is not the real thing.</p>

<p>So, when we say ""<em>everything is an object</em>"", what we really mean is that ""every <strong>object</strong> is an <code>Object</code>"", i.e. that everything which can be manipulated by the program is also a member of the object system, or in other words, there are no values outside of the object system (unlike primitives in Java). We do <em>not</em> mean that everything that exists in the language can also be manipulated at runtime by the program.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>so variables are objects</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, unfortunately, they are neither <strong>object</strong> s nor <code>Object</code>s.</p>

<p>This is also clearly stated in the Ruby Language Specification (emphasis added by me):</p>

<blockquote>
  <h1>6.2 Variables</h1>
  
  <h2>6.2.1 General description</h2>
  
  <p>A variable is denoted by a name, and <strong>refers to</strong> an object, which is called the value of the variable.
  <strong>A variable itself is not an object</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the book <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0596516177"" rel=""nofollow""><em>The Ruby Programming Language</em> by Matz and David Flanagan</a> it says on page 2:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>every value is an object</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Scala has fewer literals than other languages (for example, it doesn't have array literals or regexp literals), but it <em>does</em> have XML literals.</p>

<p>Note that in Scala 2.10 string literals become <em>vastly</em> more powerful by allowing you to intercept and re-interpret them using <code>StringContext</code>s. These more powerful string literals would allow you to implement all of your snippets, <em>including</em> XML without separate language support.

However, since types (specifically, <code>object</code>s) can be nested, this is not a limitation: you can just generate a single top-level <code>object</code> containing all the classes you need. The difference between this and your code is basically one additional <code>import</code> statement:</p>

<pre><code>package org.smth

type O = Generate(params)

// becomes

object O {
  class A { ... }
  object B { ... }
  case class C { ... }
}

// which means you need an additional

import O._
</code></pre>

<p>They thought about <code>package</code> macros that can generate entire packages full of classes, but realized that since <code>object</code>s are a superset of <code>package</code>s and type macros can generate <code>object</code>s that wouldn't be necessary.</p>

<p>Working with Ruby, when passing an object to a method, how is the memory of this object handled?  </p>

<p>Coming from a C background, I can think of several things which may be happening:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A copy of the memory associated with the according object and is made available to the method being called.  In which case the modification of the object would only be reflected in the context of method being called, and <em>not</em> the calling method.</p></li>
<li><p>A reference to the memory of the object is passed the method being called (essentially a pointer).  Hence any changes made by the object by the method being called or the calling method would be reflected in both contexts.  As well, should this program be multithreaded, some kind of mechanism (mutex, semaphore, etc.) must be used to ensure mutually exclusive access to that memory performing write operations.</p></li>
<li><p>Something else I am unable to think of... maybe a memory model similar to that of <a href=""http://golang.org/ref/mem"" rel=""nofollow"">Go</a>... Pipes... MessagePassing...?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>What is actually happening?</p>
","2988","","<p>Ruby uses pass-by-value, or more precisely, a special case of pass-by-value where the value being passed is <em>always</em> a pointer. This special case is also sometimes known as call-by-sharing, call-by-object-sharing or call-by-object.</p>

<p>It's the same convention that is used by more or less every object-oriented language ever created.</p>

<p>Note: on all existing Ruby implementations <code>Symbol</code>s, <code>Fixnum</code>s and <code>Float</code>s are actually passed <em>directly</em> by value and <em>not</em> with an intermediary pointer. However, since those three are immutable, there is no observable behavioral difference between pass-by-value and call-by-object-sharing in this case, so you can greatly simplify your mental model by simply treating <em>everything</em> as call-by-object-sharing. Just interpret these three special cases as internal compiler optimizations that you don't need to worry about.</p>

<p>Here's a simple example you can run to determine the argument passing convention of Ruby (or any other language, after you translate it):</p>

<pre><code>def is_ruby_pass_by_value?(foo)
  foo.replace('More precisely, it is call-by-object-sharing!')
  foo = 'No, Ruby is pass-by-reference.'
  return nil
end

bar = 'Yes, of course, Ruby *is* pass-by-value!'

is_ruby_pass_by_value?(bar)

p bar
# 'More precisely, it is call-by-object-sharing!'
</code></pre>

<p>In short: it's your option 2.</p>

"<p>I am learning java swing and came across the concept of anonymous inner class. After studying a bit at this <a href=""http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?AnonymousInnerClass"" rel=""nofollow"">link</a>, I feel that an anonymous inner class must always extend some other class since the method in which it gets passed as a parameter is predefined. At most, if a method accepts Object instances as parameter, only then we can create an anonymous independent inner class. I just seek your opinion whether I am right. It would be helpful if you could provide some example.

"<p>I have already read the Wikipedia article and searched for obvious places but I'm stuck. Can someone simple tell me what exactly is a Kind ? What is it used for ?</p>

<p>Scala examples are most appreciated</p>
","2988","","<p>In short: a <em>kind</em> is to <em>types</em> what a <em>type</em> is to <em>values</em>.</p>

<p>What is a <em>value</em>? <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>3</code> are values. So are <code>""Hello""</code> and <code>""World""</code>, <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>, and so forth.</p>

<p>Values belong to <em>types</em>. Types describe a set of values. <code>1</code>, <code>2</code> and <code>3</code> belong to the type <code>Nat</code>, <code>""Hello""</code> and <code>""World""</code> to the type <code>Text</code>, <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> to the type <code>Boolean</code>.</p>

<p><em>Functions</em> take one or more values as arguments and produce one or more values as results. In order to meaningfully do something with the arguments, the function needs to make some assumptions about them, this is done by constraining their types. So, function parameters and return values typically also have types.</p>

<p>Now, a function also has a type, which is described by the types of its inputs and outputs. For example, the <code>abs</code> function which computes the absolute value of a number has the type</p>

<pre><code>Number -&gt; NonNegativeNumber
</code></pre>

<p>The function <code>add</code> which adds two numbers has the type</p>

<pre><code>(Number, Number) -&gt; Number
</code></pre>

<p>The function <code>divmod</code> has the type</p>

<pre><code>(Number, Number) -&gt; (Number, Number)
</code></pre>

<p>Okay, but if functions take values as arguments and produce values as results, and functions are values, then functions can also take functions as arguments and return functions as results, right? What's the type of such a function?</p>

<p>Let's say we have a function <code>findCrossing</code> which finds the point where some other function (of numbers) crosses the y-axis. It takes as an argument the function and produces as a result a number:</p>

<pre><code>(Number -&gt; Number) -&gt; Number
</code></pre>

<p>Or a function <code>makeAdder</code> which produces a function which takes a number and adds a specific number to it:</p>

<pre><code>Number -&gt; (Number -&gt; Number)
</code></pre>

<p>And a function which computes the derivative of another function:</p>

<pre><code>(Number -&gt; Number) -&gt; (Number -&gt; Number)
</code></pre>

<p>Let's look at the level of abstraction here: a value is something very concrete. It only means one thing. If we were to order our levels of abstraction here, we could say that a value has the order 0.</p>

<p>A function, OTOH is more abstract: a single function can produce many different values. So, it has order 1.</p>

<p>A function which returns or accepts a function is even more abstract: it can produce many different functions which can produce many different values. It has order 2.</p>

<p>Generally, we call everything with an order > 1 ""<em>higher order</em>"".</p>

<p>Okay, but what about <em>kinds</em>? Well, we said above that <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>""Hello""</code>, <code>false</code> etc. have types. But what is the type of <code>Number</code>? Or <code>Text</code>? Or <code>Boolean</code>?</p>

<p>Well, its type is <code>Type</code>, of course! This ""type of a type"" is called a <em>kind</em>.</p>

<p>And just like we can have functions which construct values out of values, we can have functions which construct types out of types. These functions are called <em>type constructors</em>.</p>

<p>And just like functions have types, type constructors have kinds. For example, the <code>List</code> type constructor, which takes an element type and produces a list type for that element has kind</p>

<pre><code>Type -&gt; Type
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>Map</code> type constructor, which takes a key type and a value type and produces a map type has kind</p>

<pre><code>(Type, Type) -&gt; Type
</code></pre>

<p>Now, continuing the analogy, if we can have functions which take functions as arguments, can we also have type constructors which take type constructors as arguments? Of course!</p>

<p>An example is the <code>Functor</code> type constructor. It takes a type constructor and produces a type:</p>

<pre><code>(Type -&gt; Type) -&gt; Type
</code></pre>

<p>Notice how we always write <code>Type</code> here? Above, we had many different types like <code>Number</code>, <code>Text</code>, <code>Boolean</code> etc. Here, we <em>always</em> have only kind of type, namely <code>Type</code>. That gets tedious to (warning, bad pun ahead) type, so instead of writing <code>Type</code> everywhere, we just write <code>*</code>. I.e. <code>Functor</code> has the kind</p>

<pre><code>(* -&gt; *) -&gt; *
</code></pre>

<p>and <code>Number</code> has the kind</p>

<pre><code>*
</code></pre>

<p>Continuing the analogy, <code>Number</code>, <code>Text</code> and all others of kind <code>*</code> have order 0, <code>List</code> and all others of kind <code>* -&gt; *</code> or more generally <code>(*, …) -&gt; (*, …)</code> have order 1, <code>Functor</code> and all of kind <code>(* -&gt; *) -&gt; *</code> or <code>* -&gt; (* -&gt; *)</code> (and so forth) have order 2. Except in this case we sometimes also call it <em>rank</em> instead of order.</p>

<p>Everything above order/rank 1 is called <em>higher-order</em>, <em>higher-rank</em> or <em>higher-kinded</em>.</p>

<p>I hope the analogy is clear now: types describe sets of values; kinds describe sets of types.</p>

<hr>

<p>Aside: I completely ignored currying. Basically, currying means that you can transform any function which takes two values into a function which takes one value and returns a function which takes the other value, similarly for three, four, five, … arguments. This means that you only ever need to deal with functions with exactly one parameter, which makes languages much simpler.</p>

<p>However, this also means that technically speaking, <code>add</code> is a higher-order function (because it returns a function) which is muddying the definitions.</p>

"<p>Is there any data structure in Ruby which is similar to Pascal records?</p>

<p>I would like to define a record type which has about 15-20 fields, all of them are strings.</p>

<p>I tried to define a class for this purpose, but I realized that I have to define getter and setter methods:</p>

<pre><code>class Data
   def description
        @description
   end

   def size
        @size
   end

   def address
        @address
   end

   .
   .  all other (about 15 variables...)
   . 

   def description=( value )
        @description = value
   end

   def size=(value)
        @size=value
   end

   def address=(value)
        @address=value
   end
  .
  . more setter method (about 15 times...)
  .

end
</code></pre>

<p>To define all the 15-20 fields and getters/setters this way is quite annoying. Is there any shorter way to do it? For example:</p>

<pre><code>class Data
 desc, size, address=""""
end
</code></pre>

<p>Or something similar, and then I would be able to create a new instance of the Data class:</p>

<pre><code>d=Data.new
</code></pre>

<p>and then set the instance variables:</p>

<pre><code>d.desc=""bla""
d.size=""50.66""
d.address=""Bla street 20.""
</code></pre>

<p>I already have a method, that can parse an XML file with the XMLSimple gem, and I would like to create a record (or class) from the parsed data and return it back with the ""return"" keyword. Then I want to access the fields of the record simply: d.size, d.address, d.description and so on. For example:</p>

<pre><code>def data_import(fname=""1.xml"")
  data = XmlSimple.xml_in(fname,{'SuppressEmpty' =&gt; """"})
  d=Data.new()
  d.desc=data['desc'][0]
  d.size=data['size'][0]
  d.address=data['address'][0]
  d. ... =
  d. ... =  (about 15-20 times)
  d. ... =
  return d
end
</code></pre>

<p>my XML (1.xml):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;entity&gt;
 &lt;desc&gt;bla&lt;/desc&gt;
 &lt;size&gt;50.66&lt;/size&gt;
 &lt;address&gt;Bla street 20.&lt;/address&gt;
 .
 . (15-20 more fields)
 .
&lt;/entity&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In the Pascal language (and as far as I know in C++) there were a data structure called ""record"" for this purpose.</p>
","2988","","<p>Yes, there is, it uses the C/C++ name instead of <em>record</em>: <code>Struct</code>. <code>Struct</code> is a class factory, if you call <code>Struct.new</code>, it will return a class which has the desired fields:</p>

<p>The thing is that for <em>any</em> language, but <em>especially</em> for a library language like Scala, lexical analysis and syntactic analysis is the least interesting and most trivial part of static analysis. In order to do anything even <em>remotely</em> interesting, you need to perform a significant amount of <em>semantic</em> analysis: desugaring, type inference, type checking, kind checking, macro expansion, overload resolution, implicit resolution, name binding. In short: you need to re-implement more or less the entire Scala compiler, modulo the actual code generation part. Remember that both Scala's macro system and Scala's type system are Turing-complete (in fact, Scala's macro system <em>is</em> Scala!): there could be significant compile-time and type-level computation going on that is <em>impossible</em> to analyze without actually <em>performing</em> macro expansion, type inference and type checking.</p>

<p>But behold, there is hope: The Scala compiler itself provides an API called the <em>Presentation Compiler</em>, which is specifically designed for use by IDEs, code highlighters, and all kinds of static analysis tools. It gives you access to the entire information the compiler has during compilation, just before the optimization and code generation phases. It is used by ScalaDoc, the Scala REPL, the Scala Eclipse Plugin, the NetBeans Scala Plugin, SimplyScala.Com, the ENSIME Plugin for Emacs, some static analysis tools, and many others.</p>

Value types are pass-by-value where the value being passed is the object itself, Reference types are pass-by-value where the value being passed is a pointer to the object (also known as call-by-object-sharing).</p>

<p>Python does not support mutable value types (probably a good thing), so it is impossible to observe the distinction between pass-value-by-value and pass-pointer-by-value, so you can just treat <em>everything</em> as pass-pointer-by-value and greatly simplify your mental model.</p>

<p>C# also supports <code>out</code> parameters. They are also pass-by-reference, but it is guaranteed that the callee will never read from them, only write, so the caller does not need to initialize them beforehand. They are used to simulate multiple return values, when you would use a tuple in Python. They are kind-of like one-way pass-by-reference.</p>

"<p>Is it possible to create ranges in ruby that exclude one or both of the endpoints.  So handling the concept in mathematics of open and closed interval boundaries?</p>

I use rubymine since it integrates ruby-debug19 or something like that (it says I don't have the gem and installs it). Here is the question, I was able to step through the code and explore the variables and the stack. However, when it reaches a <code>for i in 0...5</code>, the debugger says </p>

string, return a list of words. That sounds like an array. Then, build a 
count for each distinct word. That sounds like a use for a hash---we can 
index it with the word and use the corresponding entry to keep a count.}

word_list = words_from_string(raw_text)
counts    = count_frequency(word_list)
sorted    = counts.sort_by {|word, count| count}
top_five  = sorted.last(5)

for i in 0...5            # (this is ugly code--read on

","2988","","<p>If you take a look at the Ruby Language Specification (clause 11.5.2.3.4 on p. 91), you will see that </p>

<pre><code>for i in 0...5

  count = top_five[i][1]

  count = top_five[i][1]

<p><em>except</em> that <em>no new variable scope</em> is created for the block. So, the code with <code>for</code> will be translated into the code with <code>each</code> and executed as if it were written that way, except that the variables used in the <code>for</code> loop leak into the surrounding scope.</p>

<p>To put it another way: <code>for</code> actually executes <code>each</code> but <em>without allocating a new stack frame for the block</em>. So, the error message is exactly right: there is a call to a block, but somehow there is no stack frame allocated for that block call. That obviously confuses the debugger.</p>

<p>Now, one might argue that this is a bug and that <code>for</code> loops should get special treatment inside the debugger. I guess that so far nobody has ever bothered to fix that bug, since nobody ever uses <code>for</code> loops, precisely because they leak their variables into the surrounding scope and are <em>exactly</em> equivalent to an idiomatic <code>each</code> which doesn't.</p>

<p>In your case, you <em>are</em> defining a method outside of any module: there is no mention of a module in your <code>a</code> string. The fact that you are calling <code>eval</code> on <code>A.class</code> is completely irrelevant.

"<p>I'm trying to get a better sense of <code>Ruby</code>. So Ruby makes <code>Mixins</code> a first class concept.

<p>It might be good to compare both approaches on a specific example. </p>

<p><strong>Enumerable in Ruby</strong></p>

<p>Let's take all those beautiful methods that work up on a collection. In Ruby those are <code>all?</code>, <code>any?</code>, <code>count</code> and a lot more: <a href=""http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Enumerable.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Enumerable.html</a></p>

<p>From the documentation:
<em>The Enumerable mixin provides collection classes with several traversal and searching methods, and with the ability to sort. The class must provide a method each, which yields successive members of the collection.</em></p>

<p><strong>Enumerable in C#</strong></p>

<p>In <code>C#</code> there is the feature called <code>LINQ</code> that also provides those methods <code>All</code>, <code>Any</code>, <code>Count</code> and a lot more.</p>

<p>If you want to make your class ""<code>LINQ enabled</code>"" you need to implement the <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code> interface which forces you to also provide a method <code>GetEnumerator</code> which conceptually is very close to the ruby approach.</p>

<p>So from the perspective of a bird your class now gained all those methods mentioned above. How did it happend? </p>

<p>Well <code>.NET</code> defined all those <code>LINQ</code> methods as <code>Extension Methods</code> on the <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code> interface. And since you implemented this interface you now ""mixin"" all those methods. </p>

"<p>I encountered some unauthorized strangeness working with Scala's SortedMap[A,B].  If I declare the reference to SortedMap[A,B] ""a"" to be of type Map[A,B], then map operations on ""a"" will produce a non-sorted map implementation.  </p>

    val b = a map {x =&gt; x}  // identity
    println(b.getClass+"": ""+b)

<p>So, what does it mean for a local variable to ""be in scope""? This is determined <em>syntactically</em> at <em>parse time</em>, <em>not</em> semantically at runtime. This is very important! Local variables are defined at parse time: if an assignment to a local variable is seen by the parser, the local variable is in scope from that point on.

foo # evaluates to nil, since it is declared but not initialized

<p>Why does it make sense for local variables to ""shadow"" methods and not the way around? Well, if methods did shadow local variables, there would no longer be a way to dereference those local variables. However, if local variables shadow methods, then there is still a way to call those methods: remember, the ambiguity only exists for receiverless argumentless methods calls, if you add an explicit receiver or an explicit argument list, you can still call the method:</p>

"<p>Scala's Macros and C++ templates both provide access to compile time meta-programming. Could you elaborate on similarities and differences? Are they equal in terms of expressiveness?</p>
","2988","","<p>One important difference between them is that Scala macros are written in Scala, whereas C++ templates are their own programming language, which is completely unlike C++. C++ is an imperative object-oriented strict impure language, C++ templates are a declarative hybrid logic/functional non-strict pure language, which was never intended to be used as a full-fledged programming language, and thus lacks many of the features necessary for programming in the large.</p>

"<p>I have worked in various companies and in each place people have a different opinion on whether comments should be included in code.  Some say they shouldn't because the programmer's code should be simple enough to understand and should therefore be self-commenting.  They further contest that since code frequently changes and developers are not always diligent enough to update comments along with their code that comments quickly get out of date and therefore become misleading.  The other group say that the function of code is to describe, in technical terms what the system does, but that it doesn't always describe what the business reason for the code is and that therefore comments are useful in order to give context to the code.  I tend to lean towards the former point of view.  I was wondering what the views of the community are.  Please do share your thoughts.</p>

"<p>I have a <code>List</code> class implemented with a <code>Node</code> class.  My <code>#remove!</code> method is as follows:</p>

<p><code>#find</code> does as I expect, returning the node previous to the one containing the datum searched for. So I expect this to set the previous item's pointer to the object after the searched-for item, which should remove the current item from the list.</p>

<p>I think this has to do with how block scoping, and that <code>i</code> passed to the block is not directly referencing the object it should while in the block, and thus cannot overwrite the value of its pointer. How can I force this block to alter this value, without explicitly declaring the value beforehand (which defeats the purpose of this block).</p>

<p>The <code>#find</code> method and the '#traverse' method behave as expected, so I figure this block <em>has</em> to be to blame.

","2988","","<p>RB trees are binary search trees. B trees can have more than two child nodes. In fact, the number of child nodes is variable.</p>

<p>So, you can vary the number of child nodes such that the size of a node is always a multiple of the filesystem block size. This reduces waste when reading: you cannot read less than one block anyway, you always have to read the full block, so you might just as well fill it up with useful data. Increasing the number of child nodes will also <em>decrease</em> the depth of the tree, thus decreasing the average number of ""hops"" (i.e. disk reads), which again increases performance.</p>

<p>Remember: B trees are usually used to store data structures which are orders of magnitude <em>larger</em> than memory, whereas RB trees are typically used to store data structures which are orders of magnitude <em>smaller</em> than memory. In fact, B trees are specifically designed as an on-disk data structure as opposed to an in-memory data structure.</p>

"<p>Edit: Just to clarify, I didn't intend to suggest it might be impossible to write an IDE for dynamic languages. /edit</p>

<p>In my specific experience I'm thinking about years of conversations/comments about JavaScript, many of them on stack, but every now and then somebody says this, that the reason JS doesn't have a decent IDE is because dynamic types make it too hard to do.</p>

<p>I've thought about this in terms of writing a parser for JS and I don't understand where the types have anything to do with features like auto-complete or going straight to the definitions of stuff. If anything I would imagine scope and availability through passed params in a dynamic language would be considerably easier to establish without the type-checking concern. Especially in JS where the rules are actually pretty simple in most cases.</p>

<p>Until I started hearing people cite dynamic types as if it were a technical blocking issue, I just assumed that in most dynamic scripting languages you can run from a console, reduced verbosity and the ease of testing in a live execution environment makes debug easier, thereby reducing demand for IDEs.</p>

<p>So which is it? Something about static types that makes it easier to parse code for establishing scope/availability or am I right about reduced demand?</p>
","2988","","<p>IDEs were invented in dynamic languages. Refactoring was invented in dynamic languages. Automated Refactoring Tools were invented in dynamic languages.</p>

<p>Dynamic languages had graphical IDEs with builtin support for pair programming over the network when static languages didn't even have graphics. Or IDEs. Or networking support.</p>

<p>Smalltalk and Lisp IDEs still are ahead of what's available for Java or C#, for example. In fact, Eclipse <em>was</em> a Smalltalk IDE once!</p>

<p>The quality of an IDE is dependent on how much effort is spent making it good. The Smalltalk and Lisp communities spent decades of research, dozens of PhDs and truckloads of money building powerful IDEs. So did the Java community. (Actually, they spent truckloads of money buying Smalltalk companies …)</p>

<p>The JavaScript community didn't. That's the whole difference.</p>

<p>There are some things that need a different approach between the two. Take something like IntelliSense / Content Assist / Autocompletion, for example. Statically trying to determine what identifiers are in scope in a dynamic language is basically equivalent to solving the Halting Problem, so you can't do that. Your IDE needs to be dynamic as well, then it doesn't need to do static analysis, it can just look at the running code and <em>see</em> what identifiers are in scope.</p>

","2988","","<p>Unfortunately, Ruby's Collection Operations are not type-preserving. Every collection operation always returns an <code>Array</code>.</p>

<p>For collections like <code>Set</code>s or <code>Tree</code>s, this is merely annoying, because you need to always convert them back into the type you want to have. But for example for an infinite lazy stream of all prime numbers, this is catastrophic: your program will either hang or run out of memory trying to construct an infinitely large <code>Array</code>.</p>

<p>Most Collection APIs either eliminate duplicate code or are type-preserving, but not both. E.g. .NET's Collection API mostly eliminates duplicate code, but it always returns the same type: <code>IEnumerable</code> (equivalent to Ruby's <code>Enumerator</code>). Smalltalk's Collection API is type-preserving, but it achieves this by duplicating all Collection Operations in every Collection type.</p>

<p>The only Collection API which is type-preserving yet eliminates duplication is Scala's. It achieves this by introducing the new concept of <em>Collection Builders</em>, which know how to efficiently construct a Collection of a specific type. The Collection Operations are implemented in terms of Collection Builders, and only the Collection Builders need to be duplicated … but those are specific to every Collection anyway.</p>

<p>If you want type-preserving Collection Operations in Ruby, you need to either duplicate all Collection Operations in your own Collection (which would be limited to your own code), or redesign the entire Collection API to use Builders (which would require a major redesign of not only your own code but also the existing Collections including every third-party Collection ever written).</p>

<p>It's clear that the second approach is at least impractical if not impossible. The first approach also has its problems, though: Collection Operations are <em>expected</em> to return <code>Array</code>s, violating that expectation may break other people's code!</p>

<p>You can take an approach similar to Ruby 2.0's lazy collection operations: you could add a new method <code>preserve_type</code> to your API which returns a proxy object with type-preserving Collection Operations. That way, the departure from the standard API is clearly marked in the code:</p>

<pre><code>c.select …               # always returns an Array

c.preserve_type.select … # returns whatever the type of c is

"<p>I am wandering if it is OK to use ruby's implicit return value when using <code>[]=</code> method </p>

<p><code>[]=</code> uses <code>rb_hash_aset</code> and it is returning <code>val</code> - <a href=""http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Hash.html#method-i-5B-5D-3D"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Hash.html#method-i-5B-5D-3D</a></p>

<p>here is a little code to demonstrate what I mean:</p>

<pre><code>require 'benchmark'
CACHE = {}
def uncached_method(key)
    warn ""uncached""
    rand(100)
end
def cached(key)
  CACHE[key] || (CACHE[key] = uncached_method(key))
end
def longer_cached(key)
  return CACHE[key] if CACHE[key]
  CACHE[key] = uncached_method(key)
  CACHE[key]
end

Benchmark.bm(7) do |x|
    y = rand(10000)
    cached(y)
    x.report(""shorter:"") { 10000000.times do cached(y) end }
    x.report(""longer:"") { 10000000.times do longer_cached(y) end }
end
</code></pre>

<p>of course <code>longer_cached</code> is slower because it does two hash lookups to return cached value, but when you read it line by line it makes more sense then the <code>cached</code> method.</p>

<p>I think using implicit returns is one of the things that makes ruby awesome, but I have always questioned their use when setting values.</p>

<p>So my question is: would you use implicit return from <code>(hash[key] = val)</code>?</p>
","2988","","<p>Just because nobody mentioned it so far: you are not relying on the return value of <code>Hash#[]=</code>. That return value gets ignored anyway:</p>

<pre><code>class ReturnFortyTwo
  def []=(*)
    return 42
  end
end

r = ReturnFortyTwo.new

r[23] = 'This is the value that is going to be returned, not 42'
# =&gt; 'This is the value that is going to be returned, not 42'
</code></pre>

<p>In Ruby, assignment expressions <em>always</em> evaluate to the value that is being assigned. No exception. That is guaranteed by the Language Specification. So, I don't see anything wrong with relying on that.</p>

"<p>I was reading about Singletons in Ruby. I never really had the need to use them before, but I got curious and decided to look them up, to see if I should've used them in the past, or maybe  I could use them in the future if I knew <em>what</em> they are used for.</p>

<p>The only times I can think of to use this is:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>?</strong> When I need to have a special object. Example: ""smart"" <code>Hash</code> object, that acts like a normal Ruby hash with a few additional quirks.</li>
<li>When I want to make it so only one instance of a class can exist.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, I am not really sure I had the need for either of the above.</p>
","2988","","<p>You use singleton classes all the time in Ruby. In fact, every object has a singleton class. (Note: for performance reasons, singleton classes are actually only created when you first access them, but that's a performance optimization. Semantically, every time you try to look at a singleton class, it will be there.)</p>

<p>So called ""class methods"", for example, don't actually exist in Ruby. They are just regular instance methods of the class object's singleton class. (It's just so much easier to say ""class method"" instead.)</p>

<p>Everytime you define a method with the <code>def foo.bar</code> syntax, you are adding a method to the singleton class of <code>foo</code>.</p>

<p>I just started learning ruby and I wish to achieve something like this.
Let say I have an array </p>

<pre><code>[""student"", ""student"", ""teacher"", ""teacher"", ""teacher""]
</code></pre>

<p>What I'm trying to do is to count the number of student and teacher and store it into a hash, so that i can get </p>

<pre><code>{:student= &gt; 2, :teacher=&gt; 3}
</code></pre>

<p>Could someone give me some kind of direction on how to do this?</p>
","2988","","<p>This particular problem is a great example of how choosing the right algorithm, but even more importantly the right <em>data structure</em> can massively simplify the solution. In fact, in this particular case, choosing the right data structure will make the algorithm so trivial that it basically completely vanishes: the data structure already <em>is</em> the answer.</p>

<p>The data structure I am talking about is a <code>Multiset</code>: a <code>Multiset</code> is like a <code>Set</code>, except it doesn't store only unique items, instead it stores a count of how often each item is in the <code>Multiset</code>. Basically, a <code>Set</code> tells you whether a particular item is in the <code>Set</code> <em>at all</em>, a <code>Multiset</code> in addition also tells you <em>how often</em> that particular item is in the <code>Multiset</code>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there is no <code>Multiset</code> implementation in the Ruby core library or standard library, but there are a couple of implementations floating around the web.</p>

<p>You literally just have to construct a <code>Multiset</code> from your <code>Array</code>. Here's an example:</p>

<pre><code>require 'multiset'

ary = [""student"", ""student"", ""teacher"", ""teacher"", ""teacher""]

print Multiset[*ary]
</code></pre>

<p>Yes, that's all there is to it. This prints:</p>

<pre><code>#2 ""student""
#3 ""teacher""
</code></pre>

<p>And that's it. Example, using <a href=""https://GitHub.Com/Josh/Multimap/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://GitHub.Com/Josh/Multimap/</a>:</p>

<pre><code>require 'multiset'

histogram = Multiset.new(*ary)
# =&gt; #&lt;Multiset: {""student"", ""student"", ""teacher"", ""teacher"", ""teacher""}&gt;

histogram.multiplicity('teacher')
# =&gt; 3
</code></pre>

<p>Example, using <a href=""http://maraigue.hhiro.net/multiset/index-en.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://maraigue.hhiro.net/multiset/index-en.php</a>:</p>

<pre><code>require 'multiset'

histogram = Multiset[*ary]
# =&gt; #&lt;Multiset:#2 'student', #3 'teacher'&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Another possibility is to use a <code>Hash</code>, which basically just means that instead of the <code>Multiset</code> taking care of the element counting for you, you have to do it yourself:</p>

<pre><code>histogram = ary.inject(Hash.new(0)) {|hsh, item| hsh.tap { hsh[item] += 1 }}
print histogram
# { ""student"" =&gt; 2, ""teacher"" =&gt; 3 }
</code></pre>

<p>But you can have that easier if instead of counting yourself, you use <code>Enumerable#group_by</code> to group the elements by themselves and then map the groupings to their sizes. Lastly, convert back to a <code>Hash</code>:</p>

<pre><code>Identity = -&gt;x { x }

print Hash[[ary.group_by(&amp;Identity).map {|n, ns| [n, ns.size] }]
# { ""student"" =&gt; 2, ""teacher"" =&gt; 3 }

  validates_attachment :image, :presence =&gt; true

</code></pre>

<ol>
<li><code>CommonItem</code> has no idea about class methods I invoke.</li>
<li><code>WIDTH</code> and <code>HEIGHT</code> constants are looked up in <code>CommonItem</code> instead of <code>Item1</code>.</li>

"<p>I just started learn Erlang, and really like their list comprehension syntax, for example:</p>

<p>What's the best way to do this in Ruby?</p>

<p>And even more: in erlang example, both <code>city</code> and <code>weather</code> are atoms. I don't even know how to get something that makes sense and looks good like this in ruby.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
","2988","","<p>First off, your data structures aren't equivalent. The equivalent Ruby data structure to your Erlang example would be more like</p>

            [:paris, :sun], [:boston, :fog], [:vancouver, :snow]]

<p>Secondly, yes, Ruby doesn't have list comprehensions nor pattern matching. So, the example <em>will</em> probably be more complex. Your list comprehension first filters all foggy cities, then projects the name. Let's do the same in Ruby:</p>

<pre><code>weather.select {|_, weather| weather == :fog }.map(&amp;:first)
# =&gt; [:london, :boston]

"<p>I'm programming a computer graphics application in Scala which uses a RGB class to return the color at a point in the image. As you can imagine, the function which return the color RGB object is called many times.</p>

<pre><code>class RGB(val red: Int, val green: Int, val blue: Int) { }
</code></pre>

<p>There is a function getPixelRGB which is often used as follows</p>

<pre><code>val color:RGB = getPixelRGB(image, x, y)
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that I may call this function a million times which will then, I believe, generate a million unique RGB object instances, thats a very unattractive situation. There are some thoughts I have about this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>getPixelRGB could potentially create an infinite number of objects if it was called an infinite number of times, but it need not be an infinite number of objects as there are only a maximum of 255 * 255 * 255 possible combinations which can be produced for RGB. So the number of objects created ""should"" be finite. This function could be adjusted to use a object pool where if it is to return the same color as some time before it could return the same pooled object instance for that color.</p></li>
<li><p>I could encode this RGB as a Int. An Int would have less memory overhead than a normal Scala/Java object, Java objects have extra memory overhead. Since a Scala Int type is 4 bytes wide, the first 3 bytes could store the RGB value. Only returning an Int rather than a RGB from the getPixelRGB method would be less memory overhead I assume. However how to do this while still having the convince of the RGB class?</p></li>
<li><p>Supposedly, and they are, short lived objects and I have read that the garbage collector should re-claim them quickly. However I'm still worried about it. How does the GC know that I'm throwing it away quickly? So confusing.</p></li>

<p>It doesn't know it. It <em>assumes</em> it. This is called the <em>generational hypothesis</em> on which all generational garbage collectors are built:</p>

"<p>Considering that everything in Ruby is an object and we can open irb and type things like <code>4.class</code> and <code>""Text"".class</code> to see from which class an object is, why do <code>if.class</code> and <code>unless.class</code> give no return value?</p>
","2988","","<blockquote>
  <p>Considering that everything in Ruby is an object</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That depends on your definition of ""<em>object</em>"" and every-""<em>thing</em>"". ""<em>Object</em>"" can mean ""<em>entity that can be manipulated by the program</em>"" (which I will call <strong>object</strong> from now on), or ""<em>value that is a member of the object system</em>"" (which I will call <code>Object</code> from now on).</p>

<p>In Ruby, everything that can be manipulated by the program (i.e. every <strong>object</strong>) is also an <code>Object</code>, i.e. an instance of a class. This is unlike Java, for example, where <em>primitives</em> can be manipulated by the program (i.e. are <strong>objects</strong> in that sense of the word), but aren't <code>Objects</code>. In Ruby, this distinction doesn't exist: every <strong>object</strong> is an <code>Object</code> and every <code>Object</code> is also an <strong>object</strong>.</p>

<p>However, there are <em>things</em> in the language, which <em>cannot</em> be manipulated by the program and which aren't instances of a class, i.e. they are neither <strong>object</strong> s nor <code>Object</code>s. These are, for example, methods, variables, syntax, parameter lists, argument lists, keywords.</p>

<p>Note: you can use Ruby's reflection API to give you an object that <em>represents</em> a method or a parameter list, but that object is only a proxy, it is not the real thing.</p>

<p>So, when we say ""<em>everything is an object</em>"", what we really mean is that ""every <strong>object</strong> is an <code>Object</code>"", i.e. that everything which can be manipulated by the program is also a member of the object system, or in other words, there are no values outside of the object system (unlike primitives in Java). We do <em>not</em> mean that everything that exists in the language can also be manipulated at runtime by the program.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>why do <code>if.class</code> and <code>unless.class</code> give no return value</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, first off, even <em>if</em> <code>if</code> <em>were</em> an object, those don't do what you think they do: when you say something like <code>foo</code> in Ruby, it means either ""dereference the local variable <code>foo</code>"" or ""call the method <code>foo</code> with <code>self</code> as the implicit receiver and no argument list"". So, </p>

<pre><code>if.class
</code></pre>

<p>would either give you the class of the object <em>referenced</em> by the local variable <code>if</code> or the class of the object <em>returned</em> by the method <code>if</code>, but <em>never</em> the class of <code>if</code> itself.</p>

<p>But the <code>if</code> control flow keyword isn't an object, anyway (neither an <strong>object</strong> nor an <code>Object</code>) because keywords and control flow aren't objects in Ruby.</p>

<p>In the book <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0596516177""><em>The Ruby Programming Language</em> by Matz and David Flanagan</a> it says on page 2:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>every value is an object</p>

"<p>to write custom result of splat operator, one have to implement <code>to_a</code> method. Example for the String class:</p>

  end
end

irb&gt; res = *'text'
=&gt; [""t"", ""e"", ""x"", ""t""]

<p>But without the above monkeypatch, the String class does know nothing about <code>to_a</code> method:</p>

<pre><code>irb&gt; String.respond_to? :to_a
=&gt; false
</code></pre>

<p>So the question is, what method is called when applying splat operator on a standard ""unpatched"" String's object ?</p>

<pre><code>irb&gt; res = *'text'
=&gt; ['text']
</code></pre>
","2988","","<p>First off: calling <code>String.respond_to?(:to_a)</code> will <em>not</em> tell you whether a string <em>instance</em> responds to <code>to_a</code>, it will tell you whether the <code>String</code> <em>class</em> responds to <code>to_a</code>. If you want to know whether a string responds to <code>to_a</code>, you have to ask the string:</p>

<pre><code>'text'.respond_to?(:to_a) # =&gt; false
</code></pre>

<p>Or you can ask the <code>String</code> class whether it has a public instance method <code>to_a</code>:</p>

<pre><code>String.public_instance_methods.include?(:to_a) # =&gt; false
</code></pre>

<p>Now, the <em>reason</em> why <code>String</code>s don't respond to <code>to_a</code> is because it's not clear what you want: do you want an array of characters? Of glyphs? Of lines? Of codepoints? Of bytes?</p>

<pre><code>a = *'text'.chars      # =&gt; ['a', 'b', 'c']
a = *'text'.codepoints # =&gt; [116, 101, 120, 116]
a = *'text'.bytes      # =&gt; [116, 101, 120, 116]
a = *'text'.lines      # =&gt; ['text']
</code></pre>

<p>As to why the splat operator behaves the way you are seeing, that seems to be a corner case in the language specification. I am not even 100% sure that this is intended behavior. The specification for multiple assignments runs almost 4 pages, see section 11.4.2.4 of the Ruby Language Specification for details.</p>

"<p>So, I'm kind of wanting to do something similar to rspec / mocha's <code>mock</code>, but only for two objects, and not all of them.  This is what I have so far:</p>

<p>and it would override the object I have stored in <code>self.instantiated</code>'s <code>sections</code> with my array of Section objects, <code>sections</code>. </p>

<p>The reason why I'm doing this, is because I'm storing a serialized and encrypted version of of an object, and I want to be able to unencrypt and unserialize the object, and then restore all the relationships such that I can view that object in my views, as if it were being read from the database. but that's not important, and most of it's done.</p>

<p>So, I want to be able to do this:</p>

<p><code>mock(&lt;Instance of object&gt;, :&lt;method of object that is going to be overridden, to avoid db access&gt;, &lt;the stuff to return when the overridden method is invoked)</code></p>

"<p>Of course I realize all types <em>do</em> have a common ancestor, but what I mean is this:</p>

<p>In dynamically-typed languages, it is a common practice to have 'mixed' return types. A common case is a function which attempts to retrieve data from a database, then returns either an object (initialized with the found data) or FALSE (in the event no data was found).</p>

<p>A little pseudocode to demonstrate just such an anti-pattern:</p>

<pre><code>function getObjectFromDatabase(object_id) {
  if(result = db_fetch_object(""SELECT * FROM objects WHERE id = %d"", object_id) {
    return result
  } else {
    return FALSE
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If data is found for my object id, I get a DB record back as an object. If not, I get a boolean value. Then, of course, it is on me, the client, to handle multiple possible return types.</p>

<p>Is the only way to accomplish this in Scala to find a common ancestor for all possible return types and declare that as the return type in the signature?</p>

<pre><code>// Like so:
def getObjectFromDatabase(objectId: Int): Any = {
   val result = dbFetchObject(""SELECT * FROM objects WHERE id = %d"", object_id) 
   if(result) {
     return result
   } else {
     return false
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Or is it possible to annotate multiple possible return types? </p>

<p>(Note that I do not <em>hope</em> it is possible to do this, as I would prefer it to be enforced that function return types are as unambiguous as possible. It would come as a relief to me to learn that the language forbids ambiguous return types, which is more the reason I am asking.)</p>
","2988","","<p>What you are looking for is called a <em>tagged union</em>, <em>variant</em>, <em>variant record</em>, <em>discriminated union</em>, <em>disjoint union</em>, or <em>sum type</em>.</p>

<p>Combined with <em>product types</em>, they become <em>algebraic datatypes</em>.</p>

<p>Scala does not have direct support for algebraic datatypes, but it doesn't need to, because they can be easily modeled by inheritance. (Scala <em>does</em> have the <code>sealed</code> modifier to support <em>closed</em> ADTs.)</p>

<p>In your example, if you know that the return type is either <code>SomeType</code> or <code>SomeOtherType</code>, you can model it like this:</p>

<pre><code>sealed trait ReturnType

final case class SomeType extends ReturnType
final case class SomeOtherType extends ReturnType

def meth: ReturnType
</code></pre>

<p>If you don't know what the return types are, only that there are two of them, then you can model it similarly:</p>

<pre><code>sealed trait ReturnType[A, B]

final case class Type1[A, B](a: A) extends ReturnType[A, B]
final case class Type2[A, B](b: B) extends ReturnType[A, B]

def meth: ReturnType[A, B]
</code></pre>

<p>This is actually a well-known datatype called an <code>Either</code> (because it holds either an <code>A</code> or a <code>B</code>), and is present in Scala's standard library as <code>scala.util.Either</code>.</p>

<p>But in your specific case, there is a more specific type, called <code>Maybe</code> or <code>Option</code>, which encapsulates the idea that a value maybe exists or maybe not. It looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>sealed trait Maybe[T]

case object None extends Maybe[Nothing]
final case class Just[T](value: T) extends Maybe[T]

def meth: Maybe[T]
</code></pre>

<p>Again, this is already provided by Scala as <code>scala.Option</code>.</p>

<p>The advantage of <code>Either</code> over <code>Option</code> is that it allows you to also return information in the failure case instead of only indicating that there is no value you can also say <em>why</em> there is no value. (By convention, the left side of the <code>Either</code> is the error, the right side is the ""useful"" value.)</p>

<p>The advantage of <code>Option</code> is that it is a monad. (Note: you can make <code>Either</code> a monad by biasing it either to the left or the right.)</p>

<p>But it is ugly IMHO.</p>

<p>I was thinking in extend the FalseClass or play with == but without success. Any Ideas?</p>
","2988","","<p>Unfortunately, this is not possible.</p>

<p>This is one of those annoying cases where Ruby is not object-oriented. In OO, it <em>must</em> be possible for one object to simulate another (in fact, depending on whom you ask, this is the very <em>definition</em> of OO – remember that OO came out of simulation), but it is not possible to build an object which simulates <code>false</code>.</p>

<p>This is because, in Ruby, conditional control structures are baked into the language and don't translate into message sends, whereas in other OO languages they are just regular message sends (or at least translate into message sends, just like <code>for</code> in Ruby translates into <code>each</code>). For example, in Smalltalk, Booleans are actually implemented using the Church encoding of Booleans you know from Lambda Calculus, and translated to Ruby they look a bit like this:</p>

<pre><code>class FalseClass
  def if(&amp;block)
    # do nothing
  end

  def if_then_else(then_lambda, else_lambda)
    else_lambda.()
  end

  def not
    true
  end

  def and(&amp;block)
    self
  end

  def or(&amp;block)
    block.()
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>And <code>TrueClass</code> is just the mirror image:</p>

<pre><code>class TrueClass
  def if(&amp;block)
    block.()
  end

  def if_then_else(then_lambda, else_lambda)
    then_lambda.()
  end

  def not
    false
  end

  def and(&amp;block)
    block.()
  end

  def or(&amp;block)
    self
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>And then, instead of something like</p>

<pre><code>if 2 &lt; 3 then foo end
if 2 &lt; 3 then bar else baz end
</code></pre>

<p>You would have</p>

<pre><code>(2 &lt; 3).if { foo }
(2 &lt; 3).if_then_else(-&gt; { bar }, -&gt; { baz })

# using the new keyword arguments in Ruby 2.0, it almost reads like Smalltalk:
class FalseClass
  def if(then: -&gt; {}, else: -&gt; {})
    else.()
  end
end

class TrueClass
  def if(then: -&gt; {}, else: -&gt; {})
    then.()
  end
end

(2 &lt; 3).if(then: -&gt; { bar }, else: { baz })
</code></pre>

<p>That way, you can easily create an object which simulates <code>false</code> simply by implementing the respective methods.</p>

<p>In other cases, where some object really absolutely <em>must</em> be an instance of a specific class and not just speak the correct protocol, Ruby provides an escape hatch. For example, if a method <em>really</em> requires an <code>Array</code> as an argument, then it will first try to call <code>to_ary</code> to at least give you a chance to convert your object into an <code>Array</code>. The same goes for <code>to_str</code>, <code>to_int</code>, <code>to_proc</code>, <code>to_float</code> etc. But there is no equivalent <code>to_bool</code> protocol.</p>

"<p>In the Chapter 7.3.5 ""Inheritance and Instance Variables"" of the book ""the ruby programing language"" says :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Because instance variables have nothing to do with
  inheritance, it follows that an instance variable used by a subclass cannot “shadow” an
  instance variable in the superclass. If a subclass uses an instance variable with the same
  name as a variable used by one of its ancestors, it will <strong>overwrite</strong> the value of its >ancestor’s
  variable. This can be done intentionally, to alter the behavior of the ancestor, or it can
  be done inadvertently. In the latter case, it is almost certain to cause bugs. As with the
  inheritance of private methods described earlier, this is another reason why it is only
  safe  to  extend  Ruby  classes  when  you  are  familiar  with  (and  in  control  of)  the

"<p>I am having troubles getting a slice of an infinite sequence of <code>Enumerator</code> instance in a reasonable time. I first tried <code>drop</code> and <code>take</code> chain, but it hanged forever as <code>drop</code> tried to return an infinite <code>Array</code>.

<pre><code>print exbioseq.drop(10**7).take(100)
</code></pre>

<p>Can anything be done to get a slice faster?</p>
","2988","","<p>An <code>Enumerator</code> is very general interface, it makes only very simple assumptions about the ""collection"" it is traversing. In particular, it really only supports two operations: get the current element and iterate to the next element.</p>

<p>Given those two operations, if you want to get the 10 millionth element, there is only one thing you can do: iterate 10 million times. Which takes time.</p>

<p>There is no such thing as ""slicing"" an <code>Enumerator</code>. An <code>Enumerator</code> enumerates. That's it.</p>

<p>Now, as you discovered, there is <em>another</em> problem: Ruby's collection operations are not type-preserving. No matter what type of collection you call <code>map</code> or <code>select</code> or <code>take</code> or whatever on, it will always return the same type: a fully realized, concrete, strict <code>Array</code>. That's how most collection frameworks in most languages work, e.g. in .NET all collection operations return <code>IEnumerable</code>. That's because most of these methods have only a single common implementation in the <code>Enumerable</code> mixin.</p>

<p>Smalltalk is an exception, but there is another problem: the collection operations are duplicated for every single collection type. Every collection type has its own nearly-indetical practically copy&amp;paste implementation of <code>collect:</code>, <code>select:</code> etc. This code duplication is hard to maintain and places a big burden on anyone who wants to integrate their <em>own</em> collection into the framework. In Ruby, it's easy: implement <code>each</code>, mixin <code>Enumerable</code> and you're done.</p>

<p>Note: as of Ruby 1.9, there is actually <em>some</em> of that duplication: <code>Hash</code> implements its own version of <code>select</code> which does actually return a <code>Hash</code> and not an <code>Array</code>. So, now, not only is there code duplication but also an asymmetry in the interface: all implementations of <code>select</code> return <code>Array</code>s except for the one in <code>Hash</code>.</p>

<p>The Scala 2.8 collection framework is the first time ever that someone has figured out how to provide type-preserving collection operations without code duplication. But Ruby's collection framework was designed 15 years before Scala 2.8, so it cannot take advantage of that knowledge.</p>

<p>In Ruby 2.0, there are lazy <code>Enumerator</code>s, where all collection operations return another lazy <code>Enumerator</code>. But that won't help you here: the only difference is that the lazy <code>Enumerator</code> will delay the 10 million iterations until you actually <code>print</code> the values. It still has to perform those 10 million iterations because there is simply no way to do otherwise.</p>

<p>If you want slicing, you need a sliceable data structure, such as an <code>Array</code>.</p>

<p>I'm asking here if anybody can explain this huge difference. Do I use the Enumerator improperly ? Is this a known regression in current Ruby implementation ?</p>

<p>MRI Ruby 1.9.3p385</p>
","2988","","<p><code>Enumerator</code>s are based on <code>Fiber</code>s, which you can think of as very lightweight threads. (Actually, they are coroutines.)</p>

<p><code>Range</code> uses <code>succ</code> for iteration and <code>&lt;=</code> for figuring out whether it has reached the end yet.</p>

<p>So, your <code>Range</code> example uses 20 million method calls to <code>Fixnum#succ</code> and <code>Fixnum#&lt;=</code>, both of which are heavily optimized and essentially map more or less directly to the correspondign assembly instructions.</p>

<p>Your <code>Enumerator</code> example uses 20 million calls to <code>Enumerator::Yielder#&lt;&lt;</code> (who knows how expensive that is) and <code>Fixnum#+</code> <em>as well as</em> 10 million <code>Fiber</code> context switches. I can easily imagine a <code>Fiber</code> context switch being 10 times more expensive than a simple <code>Fixnum</code> operation.</p>

"<p>Ruby use the functions from ""functional concept"" heavily, such as <strong>map, each</strong>.   They really depend on a  <strong>self-contained function</strong> which is so called <strong>block</strong> in Ruby.</p>

<p>It is very common to loop though a 2d array, make an string about the elements.</p>

<p>In java, it may looks like</p>

<pre><code>   public String toString(){
        String output = ""["";
        for (int i =0; i&lt;array.length; i++) {
            output+= ""Row ""+(i+1)+"" : "";
            for (int j=0; j&lt;array[0].length;j++ ) {
                output += array[i][j]+"", "";
            }
            output += ""\n"";
        }

        return output += ""]"";
    }
</code></pre>

<p>I tried to rewrite such a thing in ""Ruby functional Style"", but I think there are still some improvements. Eg. I want to remove the mutable variable <strong>output</strong> </p>

<pre><code>  def to_s
        output = ""[\n""
        @data.each_with_index do |row,i|
            output &lt;&lt; ""Row #{i+1} : ""
            row.each { |num| output &lt;&lt; ""#{num},"" }
            output &lt;&lt; ""\n""
        end

        output+""]""
    end
</code></pre>
","2988","","<p>Whenever you see the pattern:</p>

<ol>
<li>initialize an accumulator (in your case <code>output</code>)</li>
<li>on each iteration of some collection modify the accumulator (in your case append to it)</li>
<li>return the accumulator</li>
</ol>

<p>that's a <code>fold</code>, or in Ruby terms an <code>inject</code>.</p>

<p>Actually, that's a bit of a tautology. A <code>fold</code> is a universal method of iteration: <em>everything</em> that can be expressed by iterating over the elements of a collection can also be expressed as a <code>fold</code> over the collection. In other words: <em>all</em> methods on <code>Enumerable</code> (including <code>each</code>!) could also be defined in terms of <code>inject</code> as the primitive method instead of <code>each</code>.</p>

<p>Think about it this way: a collection can either be empty or there can be a current element.  There's no third option, if you cover those two cases, then you have covered everything. Well, <code>fold</code> takes two arguments: one which tells it what to do when the collection is empty, and one which tells it what to do with the current element. Or, put yet another way: you can see a collection as a series of instructions and <code>fold</code> is an interpreter for those instructions. There are only two kinds of instructions: the <code>END</code> instruction and a <code>VALUE(el)</code> instruction. And you can supply the interpreter code for both those instructions to the <code>fold</code>.</p>

<p>In Ruby, the second argument is not part of the argument list, it is the block.</p>

<p>So, what's it look like as a <code>fold</code>?</p>

<pre><code>def to_s
  @data.each_with_index.inject(""[\n"") do |acc, (row, i)|
    acc + ""Row #{i+1} : #{row.join(',')}\n""
  end + ']'
end
</code></pre>

<p>If you're curious about whether or not the <code>each_with_index</code> may infect your code with some non-functional impurity, rest assured that you can just as easily get rid of it by including the index in the accumulator:</p>

<pre><code>def to_s
  @data.inject([""[\n"", 1]) do |(s, i), row|
    [s + ""Row #{i} : #{row.join(',')}\n"", i+1]
  end.first + ']'
end
</code></pre>

<p>Also note that in the first case, <em>with</em> the <code>each_with_index</code>, we're not actually doing anything ""interesting"" with the accumulator, unlike the second case, where we are using it to keep count of the index. In fact, the first case is actually a restricted form of <code>fold</code>, it doesn't use all of its power. It really is just a <code>map</code>:</p>

<pre><code>def to_s
  ""[\n"" + @data.map.with_index(1) do |row, i|
    ""Row #{i} : #{row.join(',')}\n""
  end.join + ']'
end
</code></pre>

<p>In my personal opinion, it would actually be perfectly okay to use (mutable) string appending here instead of string concatenation:</p>

<pre><code>def to_s
  ""[\n"" &lt;&lt; @data.map.with_index(1) do |row, i|
    ""Row #{i} : #{row.join(',')}\n""
  end.join &lt;&lt; ']'
end
</code></pre>

<p>This saves us from creating a couple of unnecessary string objects, but more importantly: it is more idiomatic. The real problem is <em>shared</em> mutable state, but we're not sharing our mutable string here: when <code>to_s</code> returns its caller <em>does</em> get access to the string, but <code>to_s</code> itself has returned and thus no longer has access to it.</p>

<p>If you want to get real fancy, you could even use string interpolation:</p>

<pre><code>def to_s
  %Q&lt;[\n#{@data.map.with_index(1) do |row, i|
    ""Row #{i} : #{row.join(',')}\n""
  end.join}]&gt;
end
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately, this not only breaks IRb's syntax highlighting, but also my brain's ;-)</p>

","2988","","<p>The conditional operator is needed in languages like C, because <code>if</code>/<code>else</code> is a <em>statement</em>, it doesn't evaluate to a return value. But in Ruby, <em>everything</em> is an expression, <em>everything</em> has a return value, there are no statements.</p>

"<p>I am trying to make an instance of a class <code>MyClass</code> evaluate to a falsy value. So I tried to override all methods I could think of to make <code>MyClass</code> act as <code>nil</code>. I got:</p>

"<p>My understanding is that the <code>if</code> statements at the end of the line are evaluated before the code at the front of the line:</p>

<p>Now I'm really confused.</p>
","2988","","<p>In Ruby, local variables are defined by the parser when it first encounters an assignment, and are then in scope from that point on. Since Ruby is parsed like English, left-to-right, top-to-bottom, the local variable doesn't exist yet when you are using it, because the usage is further left from the assignment.</p>

<p>Here's a little demonstration:</p>

<pre><code>foo # NameError: undefined local variable or method `foo' for main:Object

if false
  foo = 42
end

foo # =&gt; nil

<p>As you can see, the local variable <em>does</em> exist on line 7 even though the assignment on line 4 was never executed. It was, however, <em>parsed</em> and that's why the local variable <code>foo</code> exists. But because the assignment was never executed, the variable is uninitialized and thus evaluates to <code>nil</code> and not <code>42</code>.</p>

<pre><code>bar if bar = true
# warning: found = in conditional, should be ==
# NameError: undefined local variable or method `bar' for main:Object

bar # =&gt; true
</code></pre>

<p>The variable is created when the assignment is parsed, which is here:</p>

<pre><code>bar if bar = true
       ^^^^^^^^^^
</code></pre>

<p>But it is used here:</p>

<pre><code>bar if bar = true
^^^
</code></pre>

<p>Which is <em>before</em> the assignment. The fact that the assignment is <em>executed</em> before the usage is irrelevant because the <em>parsing</em> is relevant here, and the assignment gets parsed <em>after</em> the usage which means that at the point of usage the parser still thinks it's a method call with no argument list and an implicit receiver (i.e. equivalent to <code>self.bar()</code>) and not a local variable.</p>

IRb on the other hand, has to ""guess"" every time when you press <kbd>ENTER</kbd> whether you simply want to continue the expression on a new line or whether you wanted to evaluate the expression as-is. As a result, IRb <em>cannot</em> just use the Ruby parser, it needs to have its own. And Ruby's grammar is so complex that writing your own parser is really really hard.

<p>In order to disambiguate that, you need to add a receiver or an argument list (even if empty) to tell Ruby that it is a message send:</p>

<pre><code>self.fnord
# NoMethodError: undefined method `fnord' for main:Object
fnord()
# NoMethodError: undefined method `fnord' for main:Object

<p>or make sure that the <em>parser</em> (<em>not</em> the evaluator) parses (<em>not</em> executes) an assignment before the usage, to tell Ruby that it is a local variable:</p>

<pre><code>if false
  fnord = 42

fnord              #=&gt; nil

"<p>I always thought that rubyists choose to make returns in ruby implicit because of a style preference (less words = more concise).  However, can someone confirm with me that in the following example you actually have to make the returns implicit or else the intended functionality won't work? (The intended functionality is to be able to split a sentence into words and return either ""Begins with a vowel"" or ""Begins with a consonant"" for each word)</p>

<pre><code># With Implicit Returns
def begins_with_vowel_or_consonant(words)
  words_array = words.split("" "").map do |word|
    if ""aeiou"".include?(word[0,1])
      ""Begins with a vowel"" # =&gt; This is an implicit return
    else
      ""Begins with a consonant"" # =&gt; This is another implicit return
    end
  end
end

# With Explicit Returns
def begins_with_vowel_or_consonant(words)
  words_array = words.split("" "").map do |word|
    if ""aeiou"".include?(word[0,1])
      return ""Begins with a vowel"" # =&gt; This is an explicit return
    else
      return ""Begins with a consonant"" # =&gt; This is another explicit return
    end
  end

<p>Now, I know there are definitely many ways to make this code more efficient and better, but the reason I've laid it out like this is to illustrate the need for the implicit returns.  Can someone confirm with me that implicit returns are indeed needed and not just a stylistic choice?</p>

<p>EDIT:
Here's an example to illustrate what I'm trying to show:</p>

<pre><code># Implicit Return
begins_with_vowel_or_consonant(""hello world"") # =&gt; [""Begins with a consonant"", ""Begins with a consonant""]

","2988","","<p>The implicit return value of a method is the last expression evaluated in the method.</p>

<p>In your case, <em>neither</em> of the two lines you annotated are the last expression. The last expression that gets evaluated is the assignment to <code>words_array</code> (which BTW is completely useless since because it is the last expression there is no way to use that variable afterwards).</p>

<p>Now, what is the value of an assignment expression? It is the value being assigned, in this particular case, the return value of the <code>map</code> method, which is an <code>Array</code>. So, that is what the method returns.</p>

<p>In the <em>second</em> example, at the very first iteration of the <code>map</code>, you will hit one of the two <code>return</code>s and thus immediately return from the method. In the first example, however, you will always iterate through the entire <code>words</code> array.</p>

<p>The problem is <em>not</em> that implicit and explicit returns are different, the problem is that the two lines you claim are implicit returns aren't.</p>

"<p>Ruby uses <code>===</code> operator on the <code>case/when</code> type execution style.Now It also known that Ruby depending on the type
of the thing present in the <code>when</code> clause, calls the respective <code>.===</code> method.</p>

<p>Say <code>when</code> statement contains the <code>class</code> names, then the rule is - <code>it will use Module#===, which will return true if the right side is an instance of,
or subclass of, the left side.</code> One example with this context is:</p>

<p>Here <code>instance of</code> test occurs</p>

<pre><code>obj = 'hello'
#=&gt; ""hello""
case obj
when String
print 'It is a string'
when Fixnum
print 'It is a number'
else
print 'It is not a string'
end
#It is a string
#=&gt; nil
</code></pre>

<p>Here <code>subclass of</code> test occurs</p>

<pre><code>num = 10
#=&gt; 10
case num
when Numeric
puts ""Right class""
else
puts ""Wrong class""
end
#Right class
#=&gt; nil
</code></pre>

<p>Now <code>when</code> contains <code>String</code> literals then String#=== is called, which in turn checks if left and right handside 
literal are same(same chracter in same sequence) or not.</p>

<pre><code>a = ""abc""
#=&gt; ""abc""
case a
when ""def"" then p ""Hi""
when ""abc"" then p ""found""
else ""not found""
end
#""found""
#=&gt; ""found""
</code></pre>

<p>The all logic is too cool. Now my query is with <code>case/when</code> structure - </p>

<ul>
<li><em><strong>How does ruby know if <code>when</code> holding <code>class</code>, or <code>String</code> literals or
anything valid at runtime?</em></strong></li>
</ul>

<p>or</p>

<ul>
<li><em><strong>What test does it perform before calling the respective <code>.===</code>
operator on the thing <code>when</code> holding currently.</em></strong></li>
</ul>

<p><em><strong>EDIT</em></strong></p>

<p>Before understanding the <code>Case/when</code> working principal,let me clear the below which <code>when</code> does while it gets its turn.</p>

<pre><code>String.===(""abc"") #=&gt; true
</code></pre>

<p>Because ""abc"" is an instance of <code>String</code> class. - Am I right?</p>

<p>Now I tried the below just to check who is whose super class.</p>

<pre><code>10.class #=&gt; Fixnum
Fixnum.superclass #=&gt; Integer
Integer.superclass #=&gt; Numeric
Numeric.superclass #=&gt; Object
</code></pre>

<p>Humm. That means the below returns <code>true</code> as Fixnum is also the indirect subclass of <code>Numeric</code>. - Am I right?</p>

<pre><code>Numeric.===(10) #=&gt; true
</code></pre>

<p>But why then the below outputs contradictory to the above?</p>

<pre><code>Numeric.===(Fixnum) #=&gt; false
</code></pre>

<p><em><strong>Trying to be more specific to my query as below :</em></strong></p>

<p>When we are calling <code>Numeric.===(10)</code> and <code>String.===(""abc"")</code> . I think we are sending not <code>""abc""</code> and <code>10</code> rather <code>""abc"".class</code> and <code>10.class</code>.</p>

<pre><code>10.===(10) #=&gt; true
Numeric.===(10) #=&gt; true
</code></pre>

<p>Now look at the above. Both return <code>true</code>. Does they output <code>true</code> on the same logic? I think <code>NO</code>. <code>10.===(10)</code> is just like
<code>10 ==(10)</code> comparison. But <code>Numeric.===(10)</code> outputs <code>true</code> as class of <code>10</code> is the subclass of <code>Numeric</code>.</p>

<pre><code>""abc"".===(""abc"") #=&gt; true
String.===(""abc"") #=&gt; true
</code></pre>

<p>Now look at the above. Both return <code>true</code>. Does they output <code>true</code> on the same logic? I think <code>NO</code>. <code>""abc"".===(""abc"")</code> is just like simple string literal comparison <code>""abc"" ==(""abc"")</code> comparison. But <code>String.===(""abc"")</code> outputs <code>true</code> as <code>""abc""</code> which is an instance of <code>String</code>.</p>

<p>Now my question is how ruby detects lefthand side operands types and apply the proper rule of comparisons ?</p>

<p>I might be 100% wrong, In that case please correct me.</p>
","2988","","<blockquote>

<p>It doesn't. It simply calls the <code>===</code> method. That's it. That's just how object-orientation works, and it is nothing specific to Ruby, <em>every</em> OO language works the same way: you call a method on an object, and the object decides how to react. (Or, in a class-based language like Ruby, PHP, Java, C#, C++, Python etc. the <em>class</em> of the object decides.)</p>

<p>Different objects may react in different ways. Classes check whether the argument is an instance of themselves, Regexps check whether the argument is matched by them, Ranges check whether the argument is covered by them.</p>

<p>It's just basic method dispatch.</p>

"<p>There were so-called <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=ruby+refinements"" rel=""nofollow"">refinements</a> introduced in Ruby 2.0. I was playing with them and now I’m totally cajoled:</p>

<p>— The main declared advantage of <code>refine</code> is that they are not global scoped. Bah.</p>

<pre><code>module MyModule
  class ::String
    def my_locally_needed_func
      # do smth 
    end
  end
end

# here I need it
require 'mymodule'
"""".my_locally_needed_func
</code></pre>

<p>is isolated not worse.</p>

<p>— Refinements do not support class methods. Bah. Of course they are through a hack (remember, everything is an object):</p>

<pre><code>module VoidRefinements
  refine String do
    def self.singleton_method_for_string_class
      puts ""inside singleton_method_for_string_class""
    end 
  end 
end

module VoidRefinementsOK
  refine Class do
    def singleton_method_for_string_class
      err_msg = ""NoMethodError: undefined method ‘#{__method__}’ for ‘#{self}:#{self.class}’""
      raise NoMethodError.new(err_msg) unless String == self
      puts ""inside proper singleton_method_for_string_class""
    end 
  end 
end

using VoidRefinements
String.singleton_method_for_string_class rescue puts $!

using VoidRefinementsOK
String.singleton_method_for_string_class rescue puts $!

# undefined method `singleton_method_for_string_class' for String:Class
# inside proper singleton_method_for_string_class
</code></pre>

<p>The latter is not even resulting in performance penalties, since nobody would call <code>Fixnum.substr</code> on purpose.</p>

<p>— Refinements are executed through <code>eval</code>. <code>refine</code> is not a keyword. Bah. (well, “bah!” again.)</p>

<p>So, my question is: am I missing smth or everybody sees no advantages in the newly introduced feature?</p>
","2988","","<p>You completely dismiss the fact that Refinements aren't globally scoped, but that's the very reason for their introduction. Of course, if you simply ignore the reason for something's existence, then you obviously won't see any value in it.</p>

<p>But, see the isolation in action. Here is your example modified to use Refinements:</p>

<pre><code>module MyModule
  refine String do
    def my_locally_needed_func
      # do smth 
    end
  end
end

module MyOtherModule
  # The monkeypatch is invisible:
  """".my_locally_needed_func
  # NoMethodError: undefined method `my_locally_needed_func' for """":String

  # I first have to use the Refinement:
  using MyModule
  """".my_locally_needed_func
end

# The monkeypatch is scoped. Even though we were able to use 
# it in MyOtherModule, we still cannot use it at the top-level:
"""".my_locally_needed_func
# NoMethodError: undefined method `my_locally_needed_func' for """":String

# We have to call `using` again, for the top-level:
using MyModule
"""".my_locally_needed_func
</code></pre>

<p>Here is <em>your</em> example for comparison:</p>

<pre><code>module MyModule
  class ::String
    def my_locally_needed_func
      # do smth 
    end
  end
end

# here I need it
"""".my_locally_needed_func
</code></pre>

<p>Note: I removed the call to <code>using</code> which didn't make sense since you didn't use Refinements anyway.</p>

<p>In your case, the monkeypatch is available globally, because you simply modified the <code>String</code> class. This functionality is called an ""open class"", and it is precisely what Refinements are there to avoid.</p>

"<p>As far as I know, Ruby has some convention on letter capitalization. Does it have any convention about <code>:UPPERCASE_SELECTORS</code>?</p>
","2988","","<p>Are you talking about the language or the community?</p>

<p>In the language, there is nothing that prevents you from using any Unicode character you want in a method name and/or a message selector. It might not be possible to define them via <code>def</code> or call them via <code>.</code>, but it <em>is</em> possible using reflection.</p>

<p>If you want to define them via <code>def</code> or call them with <code>.</code>, then there is still a lot of room: the name needs to start with an underscore or a letter (Unicode letters are perfectly fine, i.e. <code>µ</code> is a perfectly valid method name), followed by an arbitrary number of letters, numbers and underscores and optionally ending with either a question mark, exclamation mark or equals sign.</p>

<p>Starting with an uppercase letter, containing uppercase letters or even being completely uppercase is perfectly valid.</p>

<p>It is, however, not idiomatic. Not usually, anyway. Idiomatic method names are <code>snake_case</code>, i.e. starting with a lowercase letter and consisting of lowercase words separated by underscores, containing only ASCII characters.</p>

<p>There are exceptions, however. In particular, methods that are intended as factory companions for specific classes may have the same name as the corresponding class. For example, the <code>Kernel#Array</code>, <code>Kernel#Hash</code>, <code>Kernel#String</code>, <code>Kernel#Float</code> and <code>Kernel#Integer</code> methods that turn their argument into, well, an array, hash, string, float or integer.</p>

<p>Another exception are methods that are intended to be used like parametric classes, like the <code>Object#DelegateClass</code> method from the <code>delegate</code> library in the stdlib which takes a class and returns a wrapper class for that class, so that it can be used like this:</p>

<pre><code>class MyArray &lt; DelegateClass(Array); end

"<p>I was playing with method definition and calling to them in the <code>main</code> of IRB.</p>

#""hi""
#=&gt; ""hi""

self.show
#""hi""
#=&gt; ""hi""

<p>The above are good and understood.</p>

<p>Now let's try something different:</p>

<pre><code>def Foo

        #from (irb):4
        #from C:/Ruby193/bin/irb:12:in `&lt;main&gt;'

<p>While the call to <code>Foo</code> has thrown an error as above,how does the below remove that?</p>

<pre><code>self.Foo
#""hi""
#=&gt; ""hi""
</code></pre>
","2988","","<p>In Ruby, you can call methods without a receiver and without an argument list. However, this means that there is an ambiguity: does <code>foo</code> mean ""call method <code>foo</code> on the implicit receiver <code>self</code> without arguments, i.e. equivalent to <code>self.foo()</code>"" or does it mean ""dereference the variable <code>foo</code>""? Ruby can't know which you mean, so there are some simple rules.</p>

<p>For a local variable, the rule is that <code>foo</code> is <em>always</em> a method call, unless <code>foo</code> is <em>statically known at parse time</em> to be a local variable. So, when is it statically known to be a variable? When there was an assignment to that variable which was <em>parsed</em> (but not necessarily executed!) before the use.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>foo        # method call

if false
  foo = 42 # will never be executed, but *will* be parsed
end

foo        # variable dereference, since the `foo` assignment was parsed
</code></pre>

<p>For constant variables, the rule is even simpler: <code>Foo</code> is <em>always</em> interpreted as a constant dereference. Period.</p>

<p>So, how do you call a method with such a name? Easy: like I said, the ambiguity arises only for method calls with no argument list and no explicit receiver. So, if we add either one or both of those, Ruby will know that we are trying to call a method and not dereference a variable:</p>

<pre><code>foo()
self.foo
self.foo()

Foo()
self.Foo
self.Foo()
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, in the example you gave above, only the first one will work. When you define a method at the top-level, it is added as a <code>private</code> method to <code>Object</code>, and <code>private</code> methods can only be called <em>without</em> an explicit receiver, even if that receiver is <code>self</code>. So, <code>self.Foo</code> won't work, because <code>Foo</code> is private. (Except in IRb, where, for convenience reasons, top-level methods are <code>public</code>.)</p>
"
"<p>When we try to redefine a constant, Ruby shows only a warning, but not any error. So one can always redefine a constant in Ruby?</p>

<p>Also a private method of a class can be invoked using the send method:</p>

puts Const
#only an warning: already initialized constant Const
Const = 14

#obj.priv
#but this is fine!

","2988","","<p>As for <code>send</code>, the answer is rather simple: once you use reflection, all bets are off. Note that this is no different than in most other languages as well, you can also circumvent access restrictions in Java using reflection, for example.</p>

<p>And for constants, well, you <em>do</em> get a warning. You <em>do</em> get told that you are doing something you shouldn't. But Ruby is a language which trusts you that you know what you are doing. It won't get in your way. If you want to shoot yourself in the foot, you should be allowed to do that.

"<p>Recently I have been tasked with working on a fairly high volume Rails api (5k requests a second at peak).</p>

<p>Prior to this I've spent most of my coding efforts on Java applications, I'm just new to the world of Ruby/Rails.</p>

<p>At home I've been using the latest versions of Ruby/Rails to develop some small applications and get a feel for the language and framework.</p>

<p>The Rails application at work is built on Ruby 1.8.7 and Rails 2.3.16 and to me it seems quite old and there are quite a few syntax and new features missing compared with the current versions I use at home.  I prefer the newer versions of ruby and rails.</p>

<p>It appears that the Enumerator (<code>e</code>) got its <code>#drop</code> method from the <code>Enumerable</code> (module) mixed in to the <code>Enumerator</code> (class).

But there it is, documented in both <a href=""http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Enumerator.html"" rel=""nofollow""><code>Enumerator</code> in Ruby 1.9.3</a> and <a href=""http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.0/Enumerator.html"" rel=""nofollow""><code>Enumerator</code> in Ruby 2.0</a>.</p>

<p>The problem as I see it is that some methods defined in <code>Enumerable</code> work or kind of work on <code>Enumerator</code>. Examples include <code>#first</code> and <code>#take</code>. At least one other: <code>#drop</code> does not work.</p>

<p>It seems to me that <code>Enumerator</code> including <code>Enumerable</code> is a bug. What do you think?</p>

<p>PS notice that Ruby 2.0 defines <code>Enumerator::Lazy</code> (subclass of <code>Enumerator</code>) which defines a bunch of the <code>Enumerable</code> methods as always lazy.

","2988","","<p>That's a design choice that is common to many other collection frameworks as well.</p>

<p>Ruby's collection operations are not type-preserving. They <em>always</em> return an <code>Array</code>, regardless of what type of collection they were called on. That's also what, for example, .NET does, except there the type is always <code>IEnumerable</code>, which is both more useful (because more things can be represented as an <code>IEnumerable</code> than as an <code>Array</code>, e.g. infinite sequences) and at the same time less useful (because the interface of <code>IEnumerable</code> is much smaller than that of <code>Array</code>, so there are less operations you can do on it).</p>

<p>This allows Ruby's collection operations to be implemented <em>once</em>, without duplication.</p>

<p>It also means that it's very easy to integrate your own collections into Ruby's collection framework: just implement <code>each</code>, mixin <code>Enumerable</code> and you are done. If a future version of Ruby adds a new collection method (e.g. <code>flat_map</code> in Ruby 1.9), you don't have to do <em>anything</em>, it just works with your collection, too.</p>

<p>Another design choice would be to make all collection operations type-preserving. So, all collection operations return the type they were called on.</p>

<p>There are some languages which do this. It is, however, implemented by copy&amp;pasting all collection methods into all collection classes, i.e. with massive code duplication.</p>

<p>This means that if you want to add your own collection to the collection framework, you have to implement every single method of the collection protocol. And if a future version of the language adds new methods, then you have to release a new version of your collection.</p>

<p>Scala 2.8's collection framework was the first time that someone figured out how to do type-preserving collection operations without code duplication. But that was long after Ruby's collection framework was designed. When Ruby's collection framework was designed, it was simply not yet known how to do type-preserving collection operations without code duplication, and the designers of Ruby opted against duplication.</p>

<p>Starting with Ruby 1.9, there is actually some duplication. Some <code>Hash</code> methods were duplicated to return <code>Hash</code>es instead of <code>Array</code>s. And you already mentioned Ruby 2.0's <code>Enumerator::Lazy</code>, which duplicates many <code>Enumerable</code> methods to return <code>Enumerator::Lazy</code>.</p>

<p>It would be possible to use the same tricks Scala uses in Ruby, but it would require a complete rework of the collection framework, which would make every existing collection implementation obsolete. Scala was able to do this because at the time there was hardly any user base.</p>

","2988","","<p>No, there isn't. However, note that <code>hasNext</code> is not an <code>Array</code> operation in Java, either. It's an <code>Iterator</code> operation, and Ruby's equivalent to Java's <code>Iterator</code> is <code>Enumerator</code>, not <code>Array</code>.</p>

<p>However, Ruby's <code>Enumerator</code> works a little bit different than Java's: instead of asking whether there is a next element, and then advancing the iterator, you simply try to look at the next element and it throws a <code>StopIteration</code> exception when there are no more elements.</p>

An example of a gem that does this better is the <a href=""https://github.com/sferik/twitter"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter API</a>, placing its public API code in an <a href=""https://github.com/sferik/twitter/tree/master/lib/twitter/api"" rel=""nofollow"">API directory</a>, but even there the line is grey, as the public API's configure method is defined in <a href=""https://github.com/sferik/twitter/blob/master/lib/twitter.rb"" rel=""nofollow"">twitter.rb</a>, outside the API directory.</p>

<p>As a potential contributor to a gem that attempts to stick to semantic versioning (which is most of them, given we have tools like bundler), I'd like to know which methods are part of the public API, and which aren't. Maybe I have to look through more source code, but are there guidelines somewhere for clearly defining your public API?</p>
","2988","","<p>There are some popular ways to define the public API. Which one you choose is mostly a matter of taste.</p>

<p>One way is <em>documentation</em>. You simply state in the documentation, which protocols are part of the public API, and what the contract of those protocols is. YARD even has predefined tags for this.</p>

<p>Another way is <em>testing</em>. I think Merb did this. The public API was described in its RSpec tests. The private parts were obviously also tested, but those tests lived in a different directory.</p>

<p>This is actually pretty cool, because it allows you to tie together code changes and semantic version changes: everytime you add a test to the public directory you need to bump the minor version. Everytime you delete or modify a test in the public directory you need to bump the major version.</p>

<p>Or the other way round: you are not allowed to change or delete tests during a minor revision.</p>

"<p>In Ruby, like many languages, a method's arguments are not automatically assigned as instance variables. </p>

<p>This works:</p>

<pre><code>def initialize(a)
  @a = a

</code></pre>

<p>This doesn't:</p>

<pre><code>def initialize(@a)
end

<p>In CoffeeScript, for example, this works:</p>

<pre><code>constructor: (@name) -&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>There are a lot of other syntactic sugar in Ruby, such as the <code>||=</code> operator, the unary <code>&amp;</code> on symbols, etc. Is there any reason, technical or otherwise, why this sugar isn't part of the design? </p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>The scope of the question is not limited to <code>initialize</code>. </p>

"<p>I am curious on what basis ruby and ror versions are named. For example, after ruby 1.9.3, its version is 2.0 instead of 1.10 or 1.9.4, and so in rails. There must be some convention or rule.</p>
","2988","","<p>Ruby and Rails, like many other projects follow <a href=""http://SemVer.Org/"" rel=""nofollow"">Semantic Versioning</a>.</p>

<p>They don't always follow it to the letter, though. For example, Ruby 1.9 is backwards-incompatible with Ruby 1.8, whereas Ruby 2.0 is mostly compatible with Ruby 1.9, so really Ruby 1.9 should have been Ruby 2.0 and Ruby 2.0 should have been Ruby 2.1.</p>

<p>In this particular case, there were historic ""marketing"" reasons for that: the term ""Ruby 2.0"" has been used in the Ruby community for over 10 years now to mark a specific ""mythical"" version with specific, often talked-about features like scoped monkey patching and traits. Releasing a version <em>without</em> those features but still calling it ""2.0"" would have been <em>more</em> confusing than breaking the rules of Semantic Versioning. (Actually, Ruby 2.0 <em>was</em> released without traits and <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/q/15871618/2988"">it <em>has</em> led to confusion</a>!)</p>

<p>OTOH, it was impossible to call it ""1.10"", because the <code>RUBY_VERSION</code> constant returns the version as a <code>String</code>, and a lot of tools (incorrectly) do something like </p>

<pre><code>if RUBY_VERSION &lt;= '1.8'
  def foo
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>which would break, because the <code>String</code> <code>'1.10'</code> is actually <em>less than</em> the <code>String</code> <code>'1.8'</code>.</p>

<p>Therefore, it was decided to settle on 1.9.</p>

","2988","","<p>You are basically asking how to design programs. It turns out there is a book which teaches you that, and it is called … <a href=""http://HtDP.Org/"" rel=""nofollow""><em>How to Design Programs</em></a> (aka HtDP). It teaches you, well, how to design programs. And it does this by giving you recipes to follow for how to analyze problems, solve them, transform them into algorithms and further into working programs. </p>

<p>Note that ""recipe"" is basically another word for ""program"", so in other words, the book teaches you programs for humans to run in their heads in order to generate programs to be executed by computers. How cool is that? :-)</p>

<p>The authors are currently working on a <a href=""http://WWW.CCS.NEU.Edu/home/matthias/HtDP2e/Draft/"" rel=""nofollow"">draft for a second edition of HtDP</a>, which you might want to read instead of the first edition. The material about imperative programming has been removed, and is going to be covered in the as-of-yet unwritten second volume <em>How to Design Components</em>, but you can read those missing chapters from the first edition.</p>

<p>Note that HtDP assumes no programming knowledge and is targeted at high school students. But don't let that stop you: it just means that you'll probably be able to finish some early chapters faster, but I don't think you will be bored.</p>

<p><a href=""https://Gustavus.Edu/+max/concrete-abstractions.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Concrete Abstractions</a> is also a good read along similar veins. Like HtDP, it doesn't assume any programming knowledge.</p>

<p>Another book that you might hear mentioned is <a href=""http://MITPress.MIT.Edu/sicp/"" rel=""nofollow""><em>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</em></a> aka SICP. It is one of the greatest programming books ever written, and again, it doesn't assume any programming knowledge. </p>

<p>It <em>is</em>, however, geared to complete newbies <em>who study at MIT</em>. And so, while it does not assume any programming knowledge, it <em>does</em> assume quite a bit of <em>domain</em> knowledge, e.g. in the fields of electrical engineering, physics and math. Note: these have nothing to do with the <em>concepts</em> being taught, they are just needed to understand the <em>exercises</em> and <em>examples</em>. So, it might be better to read HtDP or Concrete Abstractions first, and then read SICP.</p>

"<p>I'm going through Ruby Koans, and I hit #41 which I believe is this:</p>

<p>It could not understand the behavior so I Googled it and found a <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2698460/strange-ruby-behavior-when-using-hash-new"">Stack Overflow post</a> that answered the question nicely.</p>

<p>So I understand how that works, my question is, why does a default value such as an integer that gets incremented not get changed during use?  For example:</p>

<pre><code>puts ""Text please: ""
text = gets.chomp

words = text.split("" "")
frequencies = Hash.new(0)
words.each { |word| frequencies[word] += 1 }
</code></pre>

<p>This will take user input and count the number of times each word is used, it works because the default value of 0 is always used.</p>

<p>I have a feeling it has to do with the <code>&lt;&lt;</code> operator but I'd love an explanation.</p>
","2988","","<p>The other answers seem to indicate that the difference in behavior is due to <code>Integer</code>s being immutable and <code>Array</code>s being mutable. But that is misleading. The difference is not that the <em>creator</em> of Ruby decided to make one immutable and the other mutable. The difference is that <em>you</em>, the <em>programmer</em> decided to mutate one but not the other.</p>

<p>The question is not whether <code>Array</code>s are mutable, the question is whether you <em>mutate</em> it.</p>

<p>You can get both the behaviors you see above, just by using <code>Array</code>s. Observe:</p>

<h2>One default <code>Array</code> with mutation</h2>

<pre><code>hsh = Hash.new([])

hsh[:one] &lt;&lt; 'one'
hsh[:two] &lt;&lt; 'two'

hsh[:nonexistent]
# =&gt; ['one', 'two']
# Because we mutated the default value, nonexistent keys return the changed value

hsh
# =&gt; {}
# But we never mutated the hash itself, therefore it is still empty!
</code></pre>

<h2>One default <code>Array</code> without mutation</h2>

<pre><code>hsh = Hash.new([])

hsh[:one] += ['one']
hsh[:two] += ['two']
# This is syntactic sugar for hsh[:two] = hsh[:two] + ['two']

hsh[:nonexistant]
# =&gt; []
# We didn't mutate the default value, it is still an empty array

hsh
# =&gt; { :one =&gt; ['one'], :two =&gt; ['two'] }
# This time, we *did* mutate the hash.
</code></pre>

<h2>A new, different <code>Array</code> every time with mutation</h2>

<pre><code>hsh = Hash.new { [] }
# This time, instead of a default *value*, we use a default *block*

hsh[:one] &lt;&lt; 'one'
hsh[:two] &lt;&lt; 'two'

hsh[:nonexistent]
# =&gt; []
# We *did* mutate the default value, but it was a fresh one every time.

hsh
# =&gt; {}
# But we never mutated the hash itself, therefore it is still empty!


hsh = Hash.new {|hsh, key| hsh[key] = [] }
# This time, instead of a default *value*, we use a default *block*
# And the block not only *returns* the default value, it also *assigns* it

hsh[:one] &lt;&lt; 'one'

"<p>Do I need to explicitly initialize an object if an initialize method is included in class definition? </p>
","2988","","<p>No, Ruby does not call <code>initialize</code> automatically.</p>

<p>The default implementation of <code>Class#new</code> looks a bit like this:</p>

<pre><code>class Class
  def new(*args, &amp;block)
    obj = allocate
    obj.initialize(*args, &amp;block)
    obj
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>[Actually, <code>initialize</code> is <code>private</code> by default so you need to use <code>obj.send(:initialize, *args, &amp;block)</code>.]</p>

<p>So, the default implementation of <code>Class#new</code> <em>does</em> call <code>initialize</code>, but it would be perfectly possible (albeit extremely stupid) to override or overwrite it with an implementation that does not.</p>

<p>So, it's not <em>Ruby</em> that calls <code>initialize</code>, it's <code>Class#new</code>. You may think that's splitting hairs, because <code>Class#new</code> is an integral part of Ruby, but the important thing here is: it's not some kind of language magic. It's a method like any other, and like any other method it can be overridden or overwritten to do something completely different.</p>

<p>And, of course, if you don't use <code>new</code> to create an object but instead do it manually with <code>allocate</code>, then <code>initialize</code> wouldn't be called either.</p>

<p>There <em>are</em> some cases where objects are created without calling <code>initialize</code>. E.g. when <code>dup</code>ing or <code>clone</code>ing, <code>initialize_dup</code> and <code>initialize_clone</code> are called instead of <code>initialize</code> (both of which, in turn, call <code>initialize_copy</code>). And when deserializing an object via, say, <code>Marshal</code>, its internal state is reconstructed directly (i.e. the instance variables are set reflectively) instead of through <code>initialize</code>.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>Often times, you will see a pattern emerging, where instead of having ""business"" objects inherit directly from each other, you will set up a pristine ""template"" object and have all your business objects inherit from that, kind of like this:</p>

<pre><code>var studentTemplate = {
    dispInfo: function() { return this.name + ' has an ' + this.grade; }
},

    student1 = Object.create(studentTemplate, {
    name:   { value: 'Peter Foti' },
    course: { value: 'JavaScript' },
    grade:  { value: 'A' }
}),

    student2 = Object.create(studentTemplate, {
    name:   { value: 'Olivier Perraut' },
    course: { value: 'Pétanque' },
    grade:  { value: 'F' }
});

console.log(student1.dispInfo());
// PeterFoti has an A

console.log(student2.dispInfo());
// Olivier Perraut has an F
</code></pre>

<p>By the way, I think it would be a good idea to make <code>dispInfo</code> a getter property instead of a method:</p>

<pre><code>var studentTemplate = {};

Object.defineProperty(studentTemplate, 'info', {
    get: function() { return this.name + ' has an ' + this.grade; }
});

var student1 = Object.create(studentTemplate, {
    name:   { value: 'Peter Foti' },
    course: { value: 'JavaScript' },
    grade:  { value: 'A' }
});

console.log(student1.info);
// PeterFoti has an A

"<p>I am working on iteration: time targeting section of <a href=""http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/eventmanager.html#iteration%3a-clean-phone-numbers"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> (the Event Manager exercise from Jumpstart Lab). I figured out how to iterate over the array and turn it into a hash from <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9480852/array-to-hash-words-count"">this</a> thread. This is what I have:</p>

<pre><code>require ""date""

    time = [""11/12/08 10:47"",""11/12/08 13:23"",""11/12/08 13:30"",""11/12/08 14:04"",""11/12/08 14:46""]

    #makes array of all times
    time.each do |time|
        @array = Array(DateTime.strptime(time,'%m/%d/%Y %H:%M').hour)
    end


    #makes hash of :time =&gt; number of instances
     result = Hash.new(0)
      @array.each do |time|
        result[time] += 1  
      end
     puts result
</code></pre>

<p>The hash I get when I run it is <code>{ 14 =&gt; 1 }</code>, which is not what I'm looking for.  I suspect this happens because my array is made of integers, not strings like the example. Is there a way to accomplish the same effect on integers? Or do I have to convert my integers to strings? If I have to convert to strings, where do I put <code>to_s</code>?</p>
","2988","","<p>It is important to choose the right data structure for the job. In this case, the right data structure is not a <code>Hash</code>, it is a <code>Multiset</code>. [Unfortunately, there is no <code>Multiset</code> in the standard library or the core library, but there is a <code>multiset</code> gem.]</p>

<pre><code>require 'date'
require 'multiset'

time = [
  '11/12/08 10:47',

  '11/12/08 13:30',

"<p>I saw this piece of code somewhere on the web:</p>

<pre><code>ruby -pe 'gsub /^\s*|\s*$/, """"'
</code></pre>

<p>Evidently this piece of code removes leading and trailing whitespace from each line from STDIN.</p>

<p>I understand the regex and replacement, no problem, but what I don't get is how the method <code>gsub</code> is receiving an object to act upon. I understand that the <code>-p</code> flag wraps this whole thing in a <code>while gets; print; ... ; end</code> block, but <strong>how does <code>gsub</code> receive the string to act upon</strong>? At the very least, shouldn't it be a <code>$_.gsub(..)</code> instead? How does the current input line get ""magically"" passed to <code>gsub</code>?</p>

<p>Does the code in these Perl-like one-liners get interpreted in a somewhat different manner? I'm looking for a general idea of the differences from traditional, script-based Ruby code. Haven't found a comprehensive set of resources on this, I'm afraid.</p>
","2988","","<p>Easy:</p>

<pre><code>class Object
  def gsub(*args, &amp;block)
    $_.gsub(*args, &amp;block)
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Since every object is an instance of <code>Object</code> (well, almost every object), every object has a <code>gsub</code> method now. So, you can call</p>

<pre><code>some_object.gsub('foo', 'bar')
</code></pre>

<p>on <em>any</em> object, and it will just work. And since it doesn't matter <em>what</em> object you call it on, because it doesn't actually do anything with that object, you might just as well call it on <code>self</code>:</p>

<pre><code>self.gsub('foo', 'bar')
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, since <code>self</code> is the implicit receiver, this is the same as </p>

<pre><code>gsub('foo', 'bar')
</code></pre>

<p>For methods such as this, which don't actually depend on the receiver, and are only added to  the <code>Object</code> class for convenience reasons, it is a common convention to make them <code>private</code> so that you cannot accidentally call them with an explicit receiver and then somehow get confused into thinking that this method does something to the receiver.</p>

<p>Also, it is common to put such methods (which are actually intended to be used more like <em>procedures</em> than <em>methods</em>, i.e. completely independent of their receiver) into the <code>Kernel</code> mixin, which is mixed into <code>Object</code> instead of directly into the <code>Object</code> class to distinguish them from methods that are available to every object but actually <em>do</em> depend on its internal state, such as <code>Object#class</code>, <code>Object#to_s</code> etc.</p>

<pre><code>module Kernel
  private

  def gsub(*args, &amp;block)
    $_.gsub(*args, &amp;block)
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Other methods that are defined in this way, which you may have come across already are <code>require</code>, <code>load</code>, <code>puts</code>, <code>print</code>, <code>p</code>, <code>gets</code>, <code>loop</code>, <code>raise</code>, <code>rand</code>, <code>throw</code>, <code>catch</code>, <code>lambda</code>, <code>proc</code>, <code>eval</code>, <code>Array</code>, <code>Integer</code>, <code>Float</code> etc.</p>

"<p>Or rather, why aren't there better tools for profiling memory in ruby, specifically rails apps?</p>

<p>Recently our rails app (hosted on heroku) has started seeing lots of R14 errors in the worker dynos. This means we're running out of memory. Bumping the dynos to 2x (512mb -> 1GB) only alleviated the problem temporarily, leading me to believe there is a memory leak somewhere. Naturally, my next step was to find a good profiling gem that can help me discover the source of the leak.</p>

<p>Maybe I'm just ignorant of the tools available, or maybe I just don't know how to use the ones I have. My wish is that I could install a gem and then run reports on the memory usage statistics. Hitting an endpoint to get a report is not really viable as my memory issues are isolated to worker dynos running delayed jobs.</p>

<p>I've looked at <a href=""https://github.com/ice799/memprof"">memprof</a>, but it's 1.8 only.</p>

<p>I've looked at <a href=""https://github.com/ruby-prof/ruby-prof"">ruby-prof</a> (awesome), but the memory profiling requires a patched ruby intepreter.</p>

<p>I've looked at <a href=""http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/GC/Profiler.html"">GC::Profiler</a>, but I don't understand how to find memory leaks with it.</p>

<p>So, is it just plain difficult to find memory leaks in ruby? Or am I missing the point somehow?</p>
","2988","","<p>I disagree that memory profiling in Ruby is hard. The JVM has some of the best memory profiling tools on the planet, and you can run your Ruby programs on the JVM. Don't reinvent the wheel.</p>

"<p>I would like to create a function that has optional arguments with default values</p>

<pre><code>def my_function(a = nil, b=nil, c=500)

end
</code></pre>

<p>and call the function with the arguments I would like to specify only</p>

<pre><code>my_function(b=100)
</code></pre>

<p>How do I accomplish this in Ruby 1.9.2?</p>
","2988","","<p>Arguments are bound to parameters like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>As long as there are unbound mandatory parameters at the beginning of the parameter list, bind arguments left-to-right</li>
<li>As long as there are unbound mandatory parameters at the end of the parameter list, bind arguments right-to-left</li>
<li>Any leftover arguments are bound to optional parameters left-to-right</li>
<li>Any leftover arguments are collected into an array and bound to the splat argument</li>
<li>A block is wrapped up into a <code>Proc</code> and bound to the block argument</li>
<li>If there are any unbound parameters or leftover arguments, <code>raise</code> an <code>ArgumentError</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Here's an example:</p>

<pre><code>def foo(mand1, mand2, opt1=:opt1, opt2=:opt2, *splat, mand3, mand4, &amp;block)
  p local_variables.map {|v| ""#{v} = #{eval(v.to_s)}"" }
end

foo 1, 2, 3
# ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (3 for 4+)

foo 1, 2, 3, 4
# mand1 = 1
# mand2 = 2
# opt1 = opt1
# opt2 = opt2
# splat = []
# mand3 = 3
# mand4 = 4
# block = 

foo 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
# mand1 = 1
# mand2 = 2
# opt1 = 3
# opt2 = opt2
# splat = []
# mand3 = 4
# mand4 = 5
# block = 

foo 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
# mand1 = 1
# mand2 = 2
# opt1 = 3
# opt2 = 4
# splat = []
# mand3 = 5
# mand4 = 6
# block = 

foo 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7

# splat = [5]

# mand3 = 7
# mand4 = 8
# block = #&lt;Proc:0x007fdc732cb468@(pry):42&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So, as you can see both from step 3 above and from the example, you cannot do this, because optional parameters are bound left-to-right, but you want to specify the middle argument.</p>

<p>Note that this has implications on API design: you should design your parameter lists in such a way that the most ""unstable"" optional parameters, i.e. the ones that a user most likely wants to supply themselves, are furthest to the left.</p>

But incase of Objects, the reference is duplicated and passed to the method. The reference contains the location of the object in the heap. During the method call, only the location of the object is passed. So no duplicate objects are created. The same object is modified."" </p>

<p>But when I tried the below ruby code snippet, I got the same results as I got in Java: ""The numbers work like a primitive (like in java) during a method call whereas the array works as perfect references like in java"". Now, I am confused. If everything in ruby are objects, then why the number objects are duplicated during the method call?</p>

<pre><code>class A
def meth1(a)
a = a+5
puts ""a inside meth1---#{a}""
end

def meth2(array)
array.pop
puts ""array inside meth2---#{array}""
end
end


obj1 = A.new
aa=5
obj1.meth1(aa)
puts ""aa-----#{aa}""

arr = [3,4,5]
obj1.meth2(arr)
puts ""arr---#{arr}""
</code></pre>

<p>Results:</p>

<p>a inside meth1---10</p>

<p>aa-----5</p>

<p>array inside meth2---34</p>

<p>arr---34</p>
","2988","","<p>Ruby uses pass-by-value, or more precisely, a special case of pass-by-value where the value being passed is <em>always</em> a pointer. This special case is also sometimes known as call-by-sharing, call-by-object-sharing or call-by-object.</p>

<p>It's the same convention that is used by Java (for objects), C# (by default for reference types), Smalltalk, Python, ECMAScript/JavaScript and more or less every object-oriented language ever created.</p>

<p>Note: on all existing Ruby implementations <code>Symbol</code>s, <code>Fixnum</code>s and <code>Float</code>s are actually passed <em>directly</em> by value and <em>not</em> with an intermediary pointer. However, since those three are immutable, there is no observable behavioral difference between pass-by-value and call-by-object-sharing in this case, so you can greatly simplify your mental model by simply treating <em>everything</em> as call-by-object-sharing. Just interpret these three special cases as internal compiler optimizations that you don't need to worry about.</p>

<p>Here's a simple example you can run to determine the argument passing convention of Ruby (or any other language, after you translate it):</p>

<pre><code>def is_ruby_pass_by_value?(foo)
  foo.replace('More precisely, it is call-by-object-sharing!')
  foo = 'No, Ruby is pass-by-reference.'
  return nil
end

bar = 'Yes, of course, Ruby *is* pass-by-value!'

is_ruby_pass_by_value?(bar)

p bar
# 'More precisely, it is call-by-object-sharing!'

"<p>Is there a keyword I can use to explicitly tell the map function what the result of that particular iteration should be?</p>

<p>In the above example element.to_s is implicitly the result of each iteration.</p>

<p>There are some situations where I don't want to rely on using the last executed line as the result, I would prefer to explicitly say what the result is in code.</p>

<p>For example,</p>

<pre><code>a = [1,2,3,4,5]

  else

","2988","","<p>Yes, there is, it's called <code>next</code>. However, using <code>next</code> in this particular case will <em>not</em> improve readability. On the contrary, it will a) confuse the reader and b) give him the impression that the author of that code doesn't understand Ruby.</p>

<p>The fact that <em>everything</em> is an expression in Ruby (there are <em>no</em> statements) and that every expression evaluates to the value of the last sub-expression in that expression are <em>fundamental</em> Ruby knowledge.</p>

"
"<p>I am writing a module with method <code>foo</code>, which calls a class method <code>bar</code> on the receiver's class. My current approach is to use <code>self.class.bar</code>, which works fine unless the class method is defined in an instance class instead of a ""real"" one:</p>

<pre><code>module M
  def foo
    self.class.bar
  end
end

obj = Object.new
class &lt;&lt; obj
  include M
  def self.bar
    42
  end
end

obj.foo # =&gt; NoMethodError: undefined method `bar' for Object:Class

<p>This makes sense because <code>obj.class</code> does not return singleton classes. I <strong>could</strong> use <code>obj.singleton_class</code> instead, and everything would run smoothly:</p>

<pre><code>module M
  def foo
    self.singleton_class.bar
  end
end

obj = Object.new

  include M
  def self.bar
    42

<p>only if the method is defined on a singleton class for the same reason as above. Worse still, it creates a new singleton class for every receiver, something I want to avoid as these might be a fair amount of objects. So instead, I want some way to retrieve an object's singleton class <strong>if and only if</strong> it is already defined, i.e. something of the type <code>obj.has_singleton_class ? obj.singleton_class : obj.class</code>. I couldn't find any way to perform this check though.</p>
","2988","","<p>Every object always has a singleton class in Ruby. The specific implementation you use (MRI, YARV, Rubinius, JRuby, IronRuby, MacRuby, MagLev, MRuby, etc.) may or may not optimize memory usage by not allocating memory for a singleton class that isn't used, but that's a private internal implementation detail, an invisible transparent compiler optimization. Whenever you go looking for a singleton class, it'll be there.</p>

<p>Well, actually, that's not <em>quite</em> true. Immediate values, i.e. <code>Fixnum</code>s, <code>Symbol</code>s and <code>Float</code>s <em>cannot</em> have singleton classes.</p>

<p>So, those three will <em>never</em> have a singleton class, all others <em>always</em> have a singleton class.</p>
"
"<p>I'm looking into blocks at the moment, and they have stumped me.</p>

<p>I used this as an example:</p>

<pre><code>class ProcExample
  attr_reader :proc_class
  def initialize(&amp;block)
    @stored_proc = block
    @proc_class = @stored_proc.class
  end
  def use_proc(arg)
    @stored_proc.call(arg)
  end
end

eg = ProcExample.new {|t| puts t}
p eg.proc_class
p eg.use_proc(""Whoooooooo"")
</code></pre>

<p>Now I kind of (not really( understand how the block is passed into @stored_proc. I used @proc_class because I was curious what class the block object was actually stored as.</p>

<p>But what if I wanted to store a block in a regular variable?</p>

<p>E.g.:</p>

<pre><code>block_object = {|param| puts param**2}
</code></pre>

<p>But I found that this is treated as a Hash and not a block/proc. Naturally an error arises. I've tried assigning it with an ampersand in the variable name, and at the beginning of the block but that doesn't work.</p>

<p>Eventually I was wondering if it was possible to call a function and replace the block with a variable containing the block. </p>

<p>Like so:</p>

<pre><code>(1..10).each block_object
</code></pre>

<p>Is this possible in Ruby?</p>
","2988","","<p>You cannot assign blocks to a variable.</p>

<p>Blocks aren't really objects. They are special syntax for passing code to a higher-order method. If you want a piece of executable code that you can assign to a variable, pass around and manipulate, you need to use a <code>Proc</code> object.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of <code>Proc</code>s: lambdas and regular procs. They behave differently in two aspects: argument binding semantics and <code>return</code> semantics. lambdas bind arguments like methods and <code>return</code> returns from the lambda, just like <code>return</code> in a method returns from the method. Regular procs bind arguments like blocks and <code>return</code> returns from the enclosing method, not the proc, just like <code>return</code> in a block.</p>

<p>Regular procs can be created by passing a block to <code>Proc.new</code> or alternatively to <code>Kernel#proc</code>. Lambdas can be created by passing a block to <code>Kernel#lambda</code> or with the ""stabby lambda"" literal syntax:</p>

<pre><code>lambda_object = -&gt;param { puts param**2 }
</code></pre>

<p>In order to convert <code>Proc</code>s to blocks and the other way around, Ruby has the unary prefix <code>&amp;</code> modifier. This modifier is only valid in parameter lists and argument lists. When used in a <em>parameter</em> list, it means ""wrap the block in a proc and bind it to this variable"". When used in an <em>argument</em> list. it means ""unwrap this proc into a block (and if it's not a proc already, call <code>to_proc</code> on it first) and pass it as a block argument"".</p>

<pre><code>(1..10).each(&amp;lambda_object)
</code></pre>

<p>I'm surprised that you haven't already seen the unary prefix <code>&amp;</code> modifier used in this way, it is actually fairly common, e.g. in something like <code>['1', '2'].map(&amp;:to_s)</code>.</p>

<p><em>Another</em> kind of object that also represents a piece of executable code is a <code>Method</code> object. It supports some of the same interface as <code>Proc</code>s do, in particular <code>#call</code>, <code>#to_proc</code>, <code>#arguments</code>, <code>#arity</code> etc. There are two ways to get a <code>Method</code> object: either grab a method that is bound to a receiver from that receiver using the <code>Object#method</code> method or grab an <code>UnboundMethod</code> object from a class or module (e.g. using <code>Module#instance_method</code>) and bind it to a receiver using <code>UnboundMethod#bind</code> which will return a <code>Method</code> object.</p>

<p>Since <code>Method</code> implements <code>to_proc</code>, you can pass it to a method as a block using the unary prefix <code>&amp;</code> modifier, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code># Warning: extremely silly example :-)

ary = []

(1..10).each(&amp;ary.method(:&lt;&lt;))

ary
# =&gt; [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

ary = []

(1..10).each(&amp;Array.instance_method(:&lt;&lt;).bind(ary))

","2988","","<p>Yes, you can. You just need to embed a Ruby engine in your application.</p>

<p>There's also <a href=""https://GitHub.Com/MRuby/MRuby/"" rel=""nofollow"">MRuby</a>, but unlike the others, it doesn't implement the full Ruby Language Specification, it only implements a subset of the ISO Ruby Specification which itself is only a small subset of the intersection of Ruby 1.8 and Ruby 1.9. Plus, it hasn't been released yet, as is evidenced by the fact that not even <a href=""http://MRuby.Org/"" rel=""nofollow"">its homepage</a> exists yet. It is, however, specifically designed for embedding, in both senses of the word: being embedded into other programs, and being useful on an embedded device with very little RAM.</p>

<p>As you may have noticed, it is <em>much</em> easier to embed Ruby into your app if the app is running on the Java platform or the CLI.

<p>To me this looks like the exact opposite of what I'm expecting. I am familiar with the concept of Branch Prediction. Is this a classic example of Branch Prediction? If not, what? Is there anyway to prevent any inaccuracies like this (if this is even considered one)?</p>

<p>EDIT: I did run this code over 30 times, after some suggestions. Frequently it would alternate between the two results. The sample of the data is found here:</p>

<p>gist.github.com/TheLarkInn/5599676 </p>
","2988","","<p>First of all, your benchmark is utterly pointless. The difference between the <code>do</code> / <code>end</code> syntax and the <code>{</code> / <code>}</code> syntax is just that: syntax. There is no semantic difference. Ergo, there <em>cannot possibly</em> be any runtime performance difference whatsoever between the two. It's just not logically possible. You don't need to benchmark it.</p>

<p>The only performance difference that <em>could</em> exist, is that one takes longer to parse than the other. However, none of the two is harder to parse than the other. The only difference is precedence. Therefore, there very likely isn't any performance difference in parsing, either.</p>

<p>And even if there <em>were</em> a performance difference in parsing, your benchmark wouldn't show it. You are using a benchmark written in Ruby, but in order to run Ruby code, the Ruby execution engine has to parse it first, which means that parsing will already have happened, before your benchmark even starts. So, even if your benchmark <em>weren't</em> pointless, it would still be <em>useless</em>, since it <em>cannot possibly</em> measure the performance difference in parsing.</p>

<p>As to your question about Branch Prediction: there are no branches in your code, there is nothing to predict.</p>

<p>BTW: even if your benchmark was intended for a different purpose, it still wouldn't be measuring anything, since at least the more advanced Ruby implementations would recognize that your blocks are essentially no-ops and simply optimize them away. And even if they <em>aren't</em> optimized away, all they are measuring is memory allocator performance (allocating a couple hundred megabytes of tiny <code>String</code> objects), not the performance of blocks.</p>

"<p>Beginner Scala question, but I couldn't find the answer on here.</p>

<p>Similar to overloading in C++, I would expect the compiler can tell the difference between a method called <code>-</code> which takes one parameter (with the same type as the class) and the unary version of <code>-</code> which takes no parameters, so why is <code>unary_</code> needed?</p>
","2988","","<p>The <code>unary_</code> prefix for <em>unary prefix operators</em> is a bit misleading: it's more about the <em>prefix</em> part than the <em>unary</em> part. You need some way to distinguish</p>

<pre><code>!foo // unary prefix !
</code></pre>

<p>from </p>

<pre><code>foo! // unary postfix !
</code></pre>

<p>Remember: Scala doesn't actually have operators. There are two ways to call a method, either with a <code>.</code> or with whitespace:</p>

<pre><code>foo.bar(1, ""two"")
foo bar(1, ""two"")
</code></pre>

<p>And when you have a single argument, you can leave off the parentheses:</p>

<pre><code>foo plus(1)
foo plus 1
</code></pre>

<p>Lastly, (almost) <em>any</em> character is legal in an identifier:</p>

<pre><code>foo plus 1
foo + 1
</code></pre>

<p>Now it <em>looks</em> like Scala has a binary infix <code>+</code> operator, but it actually doesn't. It's just a normal method called with normal method calling syntax.</p>

<p>What I said above isn't <em>fully</em> true, however. If Scala didn't have support for operators and it all was just normal method calling, then </p>

<pre><code>2 + 3 * 4
</code></pre>

<p>would evaluate to 20 (like it does in Smalltalk, Self and Newspeak for example) instead of 14. So, there is a <em>little</em> bit of support for operators in Scala (two little bits, actually). When a method is called with whitespace (so-called ""operator syntax"") instead of the <code>.</code>, and that method starts with an operator character, then Scala will respect operator precedence.</p>

<p>And the other little bit of operator support is that there are some operators that you would <em>like</em> to have, but that cannot be easily expressed as a method call. It works fine for binary infix operators and unary postfix operators:</p>

<pre><code>foo op bar // same as:
foo.op(bar)

foo op     // same as:
foo.op
</code></pre>

<p>But not for prefix or ""around-fix"" operators:</p>

<pre><code>!foo
foo(bar)
</code></pre>

<p>So, there are a couple of special syntactic sugar translation rules:</p>

<pre><code>!foo
foo.unary_!
// same for +, - and ~

foo(bar)
foo.apply(bar)

foo(bar) = 1
foo.update(bar, 1)

foo += 1
foo.+=(1) // but if this doesn't compile, then the compiler will also try
foo = foo.+(1)
</code></pre>

<p>And the reason why there needs to be an underscore between the alphanumeric and the ""operator"" part in a method name is because you wouldn't know whether</p>

<pre><code>foo!
</code></pre>

<p>means </p>

<pre><code>foo.!
</code></pre>

<p>or </p>

<pre><code>this.foo!

<p>Some people have asked for, and even implemented, special treatment of certain objects (e.g. <code>Range</code>s), but those patches were always rejected with the argument that special treatment for special types would only benefit those special types, whereas making Scala faster <em>in general</em> will benefit everybody.</p>

<p>Note that with Macros, it's probably possible to detect, say, iteration over a <code>Range</code> purely as a simple C style <code>for</code> loop and transform that into a <code>while</code> loop or a direct tailrecursive inner function, without having to change the spec or add special casing to the compiler.</p>

How to avoid passing by reference?</p>
","2988","","<p>Both cases are pass-by-value. JavaScript is <em>always</em> pass-by-value, there is no way to pass by reference. In particular, the value being passed is always a pointer to an object. (Actually, primitives are passed by value directly, but the difference can only be observed for mutable values and primitives are immutable, so it doesn't make a difference.)</p>

<p>In the first case you are mutating the object the pointer points to. But the reference doesn't get changed, only the object the reference points to. The reference still points to the same object, the object just looks different than it did before.</p>

<p>This specific case of pass-by-value-where-the-value-is-a-pointer is sometimes called call-by-object-sharing, call-by-object or call-by-sharing, and is the way argument passing works in pretty much all object-oriented languages: Smalltalk, Python, Ruby, Java, C# (by default, you can pass-by-reference by explicitly specifying the <code>ref</code> modifier) etc.</p>

"<p>I have an object <code>PersistentObject</code> which you can think of as plucked out of an ORM, it's an object which you can use natively in your programming language (agnostic to the backend), and it has methods <code>load</code> and <code>save</code> for committing changes to a database.</p>

<p>I want my <code>PersistentObject</code> to be faultable, i.e. I want to be able to initialize it as a lightweight pointer which server only to reference the object in the database. And when (if) the moment comes then I can fault it into memory by actually going to the database and fetching it. The point here is to be able to add this object to collections as a reference without ever needing to fetch the object. I also want to be able to initialize the object the old fashioned way with classic constructor and then commit it to the database (this is handy when you need to create a new object from scratch, rather than manipulating an existing one).</p>

<p>So I have an object which has multiple constructors: a classic one, and one that creates a fault based on the object GUID in the database. And when the object is initialized as a fault, I want instance methods to be able to access that state as an instance variable because operations on a fault are different to those on a fully loaded object. But for obvious reasons, I don't want clients messing with my inner state so I don't want to create an accessor for the ivar. So my question is, how do I init/set an ivar from a class method in an object instance in such a way that outside clients of my class can't mess with it (i.e. set its value to something else)?</p>

<p>Sorry for all the words, the code should make it a lot clearer. I've tried something which obviously doesn't work but illustrates the point nicely. Apologies if this is an elementary question, I'm quite new to Ruby.</p>

<pre><code>class PersistentObject
    def initialize(opts={})
        @id = opts[:id] || new_id
        @data = opts[:data] || nil
    end

    def self.new_fault(id)
        new_object = PersistentObject.new
        new_object.@fault = true            #&lt;----- How do you achieve this?
        new_object
    end

    def new_id
        #returns a new globally unique id
    end

    def fault?
        @fault
    end

    def load
        if fault?
            #fault in the object from the database by fetching the record corresponding to the id
            @fault = false
        end
    end

    def save
        #save the object to the database
    end
end

#I create a new object as a fault, I can add it to collections, refer to it all I want, etc., but I can't access it's data, I just have a lightweight pointer which can be created without ever hitting the database
o = PersistentObject.new_fault(""123"")

#Now let's suppose I need the object's data, so I'll load it
o.load

#Now I can use the object, change it's data, etc.
p o.data
o.data = ""foo""

#And when I'm ready I can save it back to the database
o.save

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:
I should say that my heart isn't set on accessing that instance's ivar from the class method, I'd be more than happy to hear of an idiomatic Ruby pattern for solving this problem.</p>
","2988","","<p>This is not possible. And I am not talking about ""not possible in Ruby"", I am talking about mathematically, logically impossible. You have two requirements:</p>

<ol>
<li>Another object should not be allowed to set <code>@fault</code>.</li>
<li>Another object should be allowed to set <code>@fault</code>. (Remember, <code>PersistentObject</code> is just yet another object.)</li>
</ol>

<p>It should be immediately obvious that those two requirements contradict each other and thus what you want simply <em>cannot</em> be done. Period.</p>

<p>You can create an <code>attr_writer</code> for <code>@fault</code>, then <code>PersistentObject</code> can write to it … but so can everybody else. You can make that writer <code>private</code>, then <code>PersistentObject</code> needs to use metaprogramming (i.e. <code>send</code>) to circumvent that access protection … but so can everybody else. You can use <code>instance_variable_set</code> to have <code>PersistentObject</code> set <code>@fault</code> directly … but so can everybody else.</p>

<pre><code>new_method = Note.method(:new)
chords = %w{ G Bb Dd E }
c = Chord.new(chords.map(&amp;new_method)) # BTW: you had a typo here

<p>The data structure I am talking about is a <code>Multiset</code>: a <code>Multiset</code> is like a <code>Set</code>, except it doesn't store only unique items, instead an item can be added multiple times and the <code>MultiSet</code> will keep count of how often an item was added – which is exactly what you want.

","2988","","<p>Ruby is an object-oriented language. In an object-oriented language, you send messages to objects and those objects then respond to those messages however they see fit.</p>

<p>This means that the receiver of the message, and <em>only</em> the receiver(!) is in <em>total</em> control of what a message means.</p>

<p>With some operators, however, there are certain expectations of symmetry: for example, <code>a == b</code> is expected to be the same as <code>b == a</code>. But in an OO language that is <em>impossible</em>! Either <code>a</code> or <code>b</code> <em>must</em> be the receiver of the message, so in one case <code>a</code> gets to decide whether <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are equal and in the other case <code>b</code> gets to decide. They might decide differently, and then the expectation of symmetry would be broken.</p>

<p>So, in some classes equality is actually implemented something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If I know who you are, <em>I</em> decide whether we are equal. But if I don't know who you are, I will let <em>you</em> decide, because maybe <em>you</em> know who <em>I</em> am!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here's an example: if you write your own <code>Numeric</code> class (say, a <code>Quaternion</code> class), then the system builtin <code>Fixnum</code> class doesn't know anything about <code>Quaternion</code>s. So, when you ask the <code>Fixnum</code> <code>0</code> whether it is equal to the <code>Quaternion</code> <code>(0, 0, 0, 0)</code>, it will responds <code>false</code>, even though that's <em>wrong</em>.</p>

<p>So, instead the <code>Fixnum</code> will first check: do I know how to compare myself to a <code>Quaternion</code>? No, I don't, but maybe a <code>Quaternion</code> knows how to compare itself to a <code>Fixnum</code>! After all, the <code>Quaternion</code> class didn't exist when the <code>Fixnum</code> class was written, so the <code>Fixnum</code> class <em>cannot</em> know about <code>Quaternion</code>s. But when the <code>Quaternion</code> class was written, maybe the author was so thoughtful to make it possible to compare <code>Quaternion</code>s with <code>Fixnum</code>s.</p>

<p><em>That's</em> why <code>Fixnum#==</code> reverses the arguments and tries again.</p>

<p>With <code>String</code>, it's the same but somewhat more complicated. In Ruby, <em>classes</em> aren't <em>types</em> and <em>subtyping</em> and <em>subclassing</em> are different. Ruby itself doesn't have a concept of <em>type</em> at all! The <em>type</em> of an object is its <em>protocol</em>, i.e. the messages it understands and how it responds to them. But that concept is not recorded in Ruby (unlike Objective-C, for example, which <em>does</em> have an explicit notion of <em>protocol</em>).</p>

<p>There, however, some cases, where you <em>want</em> to break OO encapsulation, and <em>know</em> the specific type and even more: the specific <em>representation</em> of the type. (Note: this violates OO, but it is sometimes necessary for performance.)</p>

<p>In cases, where Ruby needs an object to be of a <em>specific</em> class instead of just responding to a specific protocol, you would lose a lot of flexibility. You <em>have</em> to use, say, a <code>String</code>, even though you would much rather use a <code>Rope</code> instead. In order to give you back some flexibility, Ruby allows you to pass in something which is not exactly a <code>String</code> but which is equivalent to one and can be converted to one with a <code>to_str</code> method. So, unlike other languages, where <code>A IS-A String</code> is represented by <code>A</code> being a subclass of <code>String</code>, in Ruby, the relationship <code>A IS-A String</code> is represented by <code>A</code> having a <code>to_str</code> method.</p>

<p>That's what you are seeing above. If the argument to <code>String#==</code> isn't a <code>String</code>, then <code>String#==</code> doesn't know what to do with it. But if it is ""string-like"", i.e. it implements <code>to_str</code>, then maybe <em>it</em> does know how to compare itself to a <code>String</code>?</p>

<p>Note that equality is <em>very</em> hard to get right. People cannot even agree on what it means in a purely functional language, and that's the <em>easy</em> case! In Ruby, there are two additional complications: mutable state and OO. Mutable state means that two objects that were equal a moment ago may not be equal anymore a couple of moments later. Or should they be? Or shouldn't they be? And OO means that equality <em>cannot</em> be symmetric.</p>

<p>That's why the implementations of <code>==</code> for various core and stdlib classes are constantly improved. That's also why you may see weird behavior now and again. Sometimes it may just be an artifact of trying to get equality right, and sometimes it might just simply be a bug.</p>

<p>By the way: for the <em>arithmetic</em> operators, subclasses of <code>Numeric</code> actually have a more formal double-dispatch protocol using the <code>coerce</code> method. If a <code>Numeric</code> object doesn't know what to do with another <code>Numeric</code>, it will ask that other object to <code>coerce</code> the two objects to a type that <em>does</em> know that. For example, if you try to add a <code>Quaternion</code> to a <code>Fixnum</code>, the <code>Fixnum</code> won't know what to do:</p>

<pre><code>2 + Quaternion.new(1, 0, 0, 0)
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>+</code> method of <code>Fixnum</code> will then call:</p>

<pre><code>a, b = other.coerce(self)
</code></pre>

<p>IOW: it will call <code>Quaternion#coerce</code> with the equivalent of</p>

<pre><code>Quaternion.new(1, 0, 0, 0).coerce(2)
</code></pre>

<p>to which <code>Quaternion</code> will respond with an <code>Array</code> of <code>[Quaternion.new(2, 0, 0, 0), Quaternion.new(1, 0, 0, 0)]</code></p>

<p>Then, <code>Fixnum#+</code> will try again by simply calling </p>

<pre><code>a + b
</code></pre>

<p>Which will now work because <code>a</code> is a <code>Quaternion</code> also and knows how to add two <code>Quaternion</code>s.</p>

<p>A very common implementation of <code>coerce</code> is simply to swap the arguments, i.e. </p>

<pre><code>def coerce(other)
  return other, self
end
</code></pre>

<p>That's equivalent to the behavior you are seeing with <code>Fixnum#==</code>.</p>

<p>Again: this kind of dispatch is hard to get right, and there are improvements being made to the <code>coerce</code> protocol.</p>

"<p>I'm new to both Ruby and Rails, and as I go over various tutorials, I occasionally hit on a bit of Ruby syntax that I just can't grok.</p>

<p>For instance, what does this actually do?</p>

<pre><code>root to: ""welcome#index""
</code></pre>

<p>I can gather that this is probably a method named ""root"", but I'm lost after that.  ""To"" isn't a symbol, is it?  The colon would be before, as in "":to"" if it were.   Is this some form of keyword argument utilizing hashes?  I can't make this syntax work when trying it in irb with ruby1.9.3.</p>

<p>I know this might be a RTFM question, but I can't even think of what to google for this.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>I'm still playing around with this syntax,</p>

<pre><code>def func(h)
    puts h[:to]
end

x = { :to =&gt; ""welcome#index"" }
y = :to =&gt; ""welcome#index""
z = to: ""welcome#index"" 

func to: ""welcome#index""
</code></pre>

<p>I see that this example only works with the lines defining ""y"" and ""z"" commented out.  So the braceless and the ""colon-after"" syntax are only valid in the context of calling a method?</p>
","2988","","<p>As you correctly gathered, <code>root</code> is a method call. Or rather, it's a <em>message send</em>. Ruby, like Smalltalk, builds upon a messaging metaphor, where objects send messages to other objects, and those objects (called the <em>receiver</em>) respond to those messages.</p>

<p>In this case, you pass an argument to <code>root</code>, that's how you know it's a message send. Message sends are the only thing that can take arguments, if you see an argument, then it must be a message send. There are no functions, no static methods, no constructors, no procedures, only methods and message sends.</p>

<p>So, what <em>is</em> the argument? Well, in Ruby, a lot of things that are syntactically required in other languages are optional. For example, parenthesis around the argument list:</p>

<pre><code>foo.bar(baz)
# can also be written as
foo.bar baz
</code></pre>

<p>If the very last argument to the message send is a <code>Hash</code> literal, you can leave off the curly braces:</p>

<pre><code>foo.bar({ :baz =&gt; 23, :quux =&gt; 42 })
# can also be written as
foo.bar(:baz =&gt; 23, :quux =&gt; 42)
</code></pre>

<p>Put the two together, and you get:</p>

<pre><code>foo.bar({ :baz =&gt; 23, :quux =&gt; 42 })
# can also be written as
foo.bar :baz =&gt; 23, :quux =&gt; 42
</code></pre>

<p>In Ruby 1.9, a new alternative <code>Hash</code> literal syntax was introduced. This literal syntax is very limited compared to the original one, because it can only express <code>Hash</code>es whose keys are <code>Symbol</code>s which are also valid Ruby identifiers, whereas with the original syntax, you can write down a <code>Hash</code> with any arbitrary object as key. But, for <em>that</em> limited use case, it is very readable:</p>

<pre><code>{ :baz =&gt; 23, :quux =&gt; 42 }
# can also be written as
{ baz: 23, quux: 42 }
</code></pre>

<p>If we put that feature together with the other two, we get the message send syntax you are asking about:</p>

<pre><code>foo.bar baz: 23, quux: 42
</code></pre>

<p>If we have method declared with a single argument like this:</p>

<pre><code>def foo.bar(opts) p opts end
</code></pre>

<p><code>opts</code> will be bound to a single <code>Hash</code> with two key-value pairs.</p>

<p>These features were often used to emulate keyword arguments as found in other languages. And it has long been a desire of the Ruby community to get support for <em>real</em> keyword arguments. This support was implemented in two steps: first, the new <code>Hash</code> literal syntax was introduced in Ruby 1.9, which allows you to make message sends which <em>look like</em> they are using keyword arguments, even though they are really just a <code>Hash</code>. And then in a second step, in Ruby 2.0 <em>real</em> keyword arguments were introduced. The modified method signature would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>def foo.bar(baz: nil, quux: nil) p baz, quux end
</code></pre>

<p>Note that at the moment, it is not possible to have <em>required</em> keyword arguments, they <em>always</em> need to have a default value and are thus always optional. You can, however, use the fact that default values can be arbitrary expressions and do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>def foo.bar(baz: raise ArgumentError '`baz` must be supplied!', 
  quux: raise ArgumentError '`quux` must be supplied!') p baz, quux end
</code></pre>

<p>In a future version of Ruby (it was actually already implemented in February and will likely be in 2.1), required keyword arguments can be specified by omitting the default value: </p>

<pre><code>def foo.bar(baz:, quux:) p baz, quux end
</code></pre>

<p>Note that there is a syntactic ambiguity now:</p>

<pre><code>foo.bar baz: 23, quux: 42
# is this sending the message `bar` to `foo` with *one* `Hash` or *two* keywords?
</code></pre>

<p>This ambiguity is actually intentional, because it allows old client code written against APIs which use a <code>Hash</code> argument to work unchanged with new APIs that use keyword arguments. There are some semi-complex rules which determine whether that syntax will be interpreted as a <code>Hash</code> or as keywords, but mostly those rules work out the way you would expect them to.</p>

","2988","","<p>This has absolutely nothing to do with functions or keyword arguments or macros. <code>gt</code> is a local variable. Local variables are local to the scope they are defined in, in this case the script body. If you want a global variable, you need to use a global variable:</p>

$lt    = -&gt; (a, b) { a &lt; b }
$equal = -&gt; (a, b) { a == b }

  test_func.(a, b)

<p>Alternatively, you can use a nested scope. The only thing in Ruby that creates a nested scope is a block, so you need to use a block:</p>

<p>This is a design choice of Ruby which it shares with many other expression-based languages: the value of a block/subroutine/procedure/function/method is the value of the last expression evaluated inside the block. That's how it works in Lisp, for example.</p>

<p>Note that there are other choices as well. E.g. in Smalltalk, the return value of a method must be explicitly returned using the <code>↑</code> operator, otherwise the return value is <code>nil</code>.

class B &lt; A

"<p>In the <a href=""http://www.mozart-oz.org/documentation/tutorial/node6.html"" rel=""nofollow"">chapter about function in the Oz tutorial</a>, it says that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>similar to lazy functional languages
  Oz allows certain forms of
  tail-recursion optimizations that are
  not found in certain strict functional
  languages including Standard ML,
  Scheme, and the concurrent functional
  language Erlang. However, standard
  function definitions in Oz are not
  lazy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It then goes on to show the following function which is tail-recursive in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oz_%28programming_language%29"" rel=""nofollow"">Oz</a>:</p>

<pre><code>fun {Map Xs F}
   case Xs
   of nil then nil
   [] X|Xr then {F X}|{Map Xr F}
   end 
end 
</code></pre>

<p>What this does is, it maps the empty list to the empty list and non-empty list, to the result of applying the function <code>F</code> to its head and then prepending that to the result of calling <code>Map</code> on the tail. In other languages this would not be tail recursive, because the last operation is the prepend, not the recursive call to <code>Map</code>.</p>

<p>So my question is: If ""standard function definitions in Oz are not lazy"", what does Oz do that languages like Scheme or Erlang can't (or won't?) to be able to perform tail-recursion optimization for this function? And exactly when is a function tail-recursive in Oz?</p>
","2988","","<p>This is called <a href=""https://EN.Wikipedia.Org/wiki/Tail_call#Tail_recursion_modulo_cons"" rel=""nofollow""><em>Tail Recursion Modulo <code>Cons</code></em></a>. Basically, <em>prepending</em> to the list directly <em>after</em> the recursive call is the same as <em>appending</em> to the list directly <em>before</em> the recursive call (and thus building the list as a ""side-effect"" of the purely functional ""loop""). This is a generalization of tail recursion that works not just with <code>cons</code> lists but any data constructor with constant operations.</p>

<p>It was first described (but not named) as a LISP compilation technique in 1974 by Daniel P. Friedman and David S. Wise in <a href=""http://www.cs.indiana.edu/cgi-bin/techreports/TRNNN.cgi?trnum=TR19"" rel=""nofollow""><em>Technical Report TR19: Unwinding Structured Recursions into Iterations</em></a> and it was formally named and introduced by David H. D. Warren in 1980 in the context of writing the first-ever Prolog compiler.</p>

<p>The interesting thing about Oz, though, is that TRMC is neither a language feature nor an explicit compiler optimization, it's just a side-effect of the language's execution semantics. Specifically, the fact that Oz is a declarative concurrent constraint language, which means that every variable is a dataflow variable (or ""everything is a promise"", including every storage location). Since everything is a promise, we can model returning from a function as <em>first</em> setting up the return value as a promise, and then <em>later on</em> fulfilling it.</p>

<p>Peter van Roy, co-author of the book <a href=""http://WWW.Info.UCL.Ac.Be/~pvr/book"" rel=""nofollow""><em>Concepts, Techniques, and Models of Computer Programming</em> by Peter Van Roy and Seif Haridi</a>, also one of the designers of Oz, and one of its implementators, explains how exactly TRMC works in a comment thread on Lambda the Ultimate: <a href=""http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/2273#comment-40235"" rel=""nofollow""><em>Tail-recursive map and declarative agents</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The above example of bad Scheme code turns into good tail-recursive Oz code when translated directly into Oz syntax. This gives:</p>

<pre><code>fun {Map F Xs}
   if Xs==nil then nil
   else {F Xs.1}|{Map F Xs.2} end
end
</code></pre>
  
  <p>This is because Oz has single-assignment variables. To understand the execution, we translate this example into the Oz kernel language (I give just a partial translation for clarity):</p>

<pre><code>proc {Map F Xs Ys}
   if Xs==nil then Ys=nil
   else local Y Yr in
      Ys=Y|Yr
      {F Xs.1 Y}
      {Map F Xs.2 Yr}
   end end
end
</code></pre>
  
  <p>That is, <code>Map</code> is tail-recursive because <code>Yr</code> is initially unbound. This is not just a clever trick; it is profound because it allows declarative concurrency and declarative multi-agent systems.</p>

"<p>As far as I can tell, there are essentially three different kinds of closure in Ruby; methods, procs and lambdas. I know that there are differences between them, but could we not just get away having one type that accommodates all possible use-cases?  </p>

<p>Methods can already be passed around like procs and lambdas by calling <code>self.method(method_name)</code>, and the only significant differences that I'm aware of between procs and lambdas is that lambdas check arity and procs do crazy things when you try to use <code>return</code>. So couldn't we just merge them all into one and be done with it?</p>
","2988","","<blockquote>
  <p>As far as I can tell, there are essentially three different kinds of closure in Ruby; methods, procs and lambdas.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, there are two: methods aren't closures, only procs and lambdas are. (Or at least <em>can</em> be, most of them aren't.)</p>

<p>There are two ways of packaging up a piece of executable code for reuse in Ruby: methods and blocks. Strictly speaking, blocks aren't necessary, you can get by with just methods. But blocks are meant to be extremely light-weight, conceptually, semantically and syntactically. That's not true for methods.</p>

<p>Because they are meant to be light-weight and easy to use, blocks behave different from methods in some respects, e.g. how arguments are bound to parameters. Block parameters are bound more like the left-hand side of an assignment than like method parameters.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<p>Passing a single array to multiple parameters:</p>

<pre><code>def foo(a, b) end
foo([1, 2, 3]) # ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (1 for 2)

a, b = [1, 2, 3]
# a == 1; b == 2

[[1, 2, 3]].each {|a, b| puts ""a == #{a}; b == #{b}"" }
# a == 1; b ==2
</code></pre>

<p>Passing less arguments than parameters:</p>

<pre><code>def foo(a, b, c) end
foo(1, 2) # ArgumentError

a, b, c = 1, 2
# a == 1; b == 2; c == nil

[[1, 2]].each {|a, b, c| puts ""a == #{a}; b == #{b}; c == #{c}"" }
# a == 1; b == 2; c == 
</code></pre>

<p>Passing more arguments than parameters:</p>

<pre><code>def foo(a, b) end
foo(1, 2, 3) # ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (3 for 2)

a, b = 1, 2, 3
# a == 1; b == 2

[[1, 2, 3]].each {|a, b| puts ""a == #{a}; b == #{b}"" }
# a == 1; b == 2
</code></pre>

<p>[By the way: none of the blocks above are closures.]</p>

<p>This allows, for example, the <code>Enumerable</code> protocol which always yields a <em>single</em> element to the block to work with <code>Hash</code>es: you just make the <em>single</em> element an <code>Array</code> of <code>[key, value]</code> and rely on the implicit array destructuring of the block:</p>

<pre><code>{one: 1, two: 2}.each {|k, v| puts ""#{key} is assigned to #{value}"" }
</code></pre>

<p>is much easier to understand than what you would have to otherwise write:</p>

<pre><code>{one: 1, two: 2}.each {|el| puts ""#{el.first} is assigned to #{el.last}"" }
</code></pre>

<p>Another difference between blocks and methods is that methods use the <code>return</code> keyword to return a value whereas blocks use the <code>next</code> keyword.</p>

<p>If you agree that it makes sense to have both methods and blocks in the language, then it is just a small step to also accept the existence of both procs and lambdas, because they behave like blocks and methods, respectively:</p>

<ul>
<li>procs <code>return</code> from the enclosing method (just like blocks) and they bind arguments exactly like blocks do</li>
<li>lambdas <code>return</code> from themselves (just like methods) and they bind arguments exactly like methods do.</li>
</ul>

<p>IOW: the proc/lambda dichotomy just mirrors the block/method dichotomy.</p>

<p>Note that there are actually quite a lot more cases to consider. For example, what does <code>self</code> mean? Does it mean</p>

<ul>
<li>whatever <code>self</code> was at the point the block was written</li>
<li>whatever <code>self</code> is at the point the block is run</li>
<li>the block itself</li>
</ul>

<p>And what about <code>return</code>? Does it mean</p>

<ul>
<li>return from the method the block is written in</li>
<li>return from the method the block is run in</li>
<li>return from the block itself?</li>
</ul>

<p>This <em>already</em> gives you <em>nine</em> possibilities, even <em>without</em> taking into account the Ruby-specific peculiarities of parameter binding.</p>

<p>Now, for reasons of encapsulation, #2 above are really bad ideas, so that reduces our choices somewhat.</p>

<p>As always, it's a matter of taste of the language designer. There are other such redundancies in Ruby as well: why do you need both instance variables and local variables? If lexical scopes were objects, then local variables would just be instance variables of the lexical scope and you wouldn't need local variables. And why do you need both instance variables and methods? One of them is enough: a getter/setter pair of methods can replace an instance variable (see Newspeak for an example of such a language) and first-class procedures assigned to instance variables can replace methods (see Self, Python, JavaScript). Why do you need both classes and modules? If you allow classes to be mixed-in, then you can get rid of modules and use classes both as classes and mixins. And why do you need mixins at all? If everything is a method call, classes automatically become mixins anyway (again, see Newspeak for an example). And of course, if you allow inheritance directly between objects you don't need classes at all (see Self, Io, Ioke, Seph, JavaScript)</p>

"<p>There's a nice idiom for adding to lists stored in a hash table:</p>

<pre><code>(hash[key] ||= []) &lt;&lt; new_value
</code></pre>

<p>Now, suppose I write a derivative hash class, like the ones found in Hashie, which does a deep-convert of any hash I store in it. Then what I store will not be the same object I passed to the = operator; Hash may be converted to Mash or Clash, and arrays may be copied.</p>

<p>Here's the problem. Ruby apparently returns, from the var= method, the value passed in, not the value that's stored. It doesn't matter what the var= method returns. The code below demonstrates this:</p>

<pre><code>class C
  attr_reader :foo
  def foo=(value)
    @foo = (value.is_a? Array) ? (value.clone) : value

c=C.new
puts ""assignment: #{(c.foo ||= []) &lt;&lt; 5}""
puts ""c.foo is #{c.foo}""
puts ""assignment: #{(c.foo ||= []) &lt;&lt; 6}""
puts ""c.foo is #{c.foo}""
</code></pre>

<p>output is</p>

<pre><code>assignment: [5]
c.foo is []
assignment: [6]
c.foo is [6]
</code></pre>

<p>When I posted this as a bug to Hashie, Danielle Sucher explained what was happening and pointed out that ""foo.send :bar=, 1"" returns the value returned by the bar= method. (Hat tip for the research!) So I guess I could do:</p>

<pre><code>c=C.new
puts ""clunky assignment: #{(c.foo || c.send(:foo=, [])) &lt;&lt; 5}""
puts ""c.foo is #{c.foo}""
puts ""assignment: #{(c.foo || c.send(:foo=, [])) &lt;&lt; 6}""
puts ""c.foo is #{c.foo}""
</code></pre>

<p>which prints</p>

<pre><code>clunky assignment: [5]
c.foo is [5]
assignment: [5, 6]
c.foo is [5, 6]

","2988","","<p>Assignments evaluate to the value that is being assigned. Period.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>The standard way of solving this would be to add an extra parameter for passing along that extra information:</p>

<pre><code>def run_app(name, startr, constant_var)
  some_name = modify name
  compare(some_name, constant_var)

  # recursive call
  run_app(some_name, 0, constant_var)
end
</code></pre>

<p>Then you need to call the method like this:</p>

<pre><code>run_app(tmp = 'john', 1, tmp)

# or

run_app('john', 2, nil)
</code></pre>

<p>However, this leaks a <em>ton</em> of internal implementation details out to the caller and places a heavy burden on them. For example, they need to know that the first and third argument need to be the same object. But only if they pass <code>1</code> as the second argument. If they pass something other than <code>1</code>, then they need to pass <code>nil</code> as the third argument.</p>

<p>What's to stop someone from calling </p>

<pre><code>run_app('john', 1, 'ringo')

# or 

run_app(tmp = 'john', 2, tmp)
</code></pre>

<p>You can slightly improve that by using an optional parameter with a default argument:</p>

<pre><code>def run_app(name, startr, constant_var = name if startr == 1)
  some_name = modify name
  compare(some_name, constant_var)

  # recursive call
  run_app(some_name, 0, constant_var)
end
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can call it like you want to:</p>

<pre><code>run_app('john', 1)

# or

run_app('john', 2)
</code></pre>

<p>However, you can <em>still</em> call it like this:</p>

<pre><code>run_app('john', 1, 'ringo')

# or 

run_app(tmp = 'john', 2, tmp)
</code></pre>

<p>So, what we do is to move that logic into a <code>private</code> helper method and give the public method the API we want:</p>

<pre><code>def run_app(name, startr)
  constant_var = name if startr == 1

  run_app_r(name, startr, constant_var)
end

private

def run_app_r(name, startr, constant_var)
  some_name = modify name
  compare(some_name, constant_var)

  # recursive call
  run_app_r(some_name, 0, constant_var)
end
</code></pre>

<p>Call it like this:</p>

<pre><code>run_app('john', 1)

# or

run_app('john', 2)
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, you can now <em>still</em> call </p>

<pre><code>run_app_r('john', 1, 'ringo')

# or 

run_app_r(tmp = 'john', 2, tmp)
</code></pre>

<p>But at least you now have a <em>separate</em> method which you can clearly document as <code>private</code>, e.g. by using YARD's <code>@private</code> tag or just use RDoc's <code>:nodoc:</code> tag to leave it out of the docs completely.</p>

<p>The fact that the <code>run_app_r</code> method can be called from everywhere even though it is only meant to be called inside <code>run_app</code> is pretty annoying. In a language like Scala which supports nested methods you would just put the <code>run_app_r</code> method inside of the <code>run_app</code> method, but Ruby doesn't support nested methods, so we have to find another way: <code>Proc</code>s can be nested inside methods!</p>

<pre><code>def run_app(name, startr)
  constant_var = name if startr == 1

  (run_app_r = -&gt;(name, startr, constant_var; some_name) {
    some_name = modify name
    compare(some_name, constant_var)

    # recursive call
    run_app_r.(some_name, 0, constant_var)
  }).(name, startr, constant_var)
end
</code></pre>

<p>Call it like this:</p>

<pre><code>run_app('john', 1)

# or

run_app('john', 2)
</code></pre>

<p>And since blocks are closures, we don't even need to explicitly pass <code>constant_var</code> along:</p>

<pre><code>def run_app(name, startr)
  constant_var = name if startr == 1

  (run_app_r = -&gt;(name, startr; some_name) {
    some_name = modify name
    compare(some_name, constant_var)

    # recursive call
    run_app_r.(some_name, 0)
  }).(name, startr)
end
</code></pre>

<p>Call it like this:</p>

<pre><code>run_app('john', 1)

# or

run_app('john', 2)
</code></pre>

<p>But all of this is moot, because your recursion doesn't have a base case and thus will loop infinitely. Or rather, you will get a stack overflow because Ruby doesn't guarantee proper tail calls.</p>

"<p>I have written a gem that <em>uses</em> a <a href=""http://code.jjb.cc/2012/09/15/sane_timeout-a-replacement-for-rubys-standard-library-timeout/"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""gem"">gem</a> in one of its classes to overwrite <code>Timeout</code>. I only want to overwrite <code>Timeout</code> in this single instance, not globally in my gem and certainly not globally in anyone's project that uses my gem.</p>

<p>The problem I'm running into is when I include <em>my</em> gem in a rails project. It seems that the timeout gem gets instantiated from the get-go (at rails app load) and affects other parts of my Rails app that rely on the standard <code>Timeout</code>.</p>

<p>My question is this: how can I limit the timeout gem's influence to only the single class that I wish to use it in. I've already placed the <code>require</code> statement within the class definition and this didn't seem to help.</p>
","2988","","<p>This is not possible without cooperation of the gem author.</p>

<p>When you <code>require</code> a file, the code in the file gets run. Period. If the code in the file monkeypatches a class or modifies the global namespace or whatever, that will happen. Period.</p>

<p>You can use <code>load</code> instead of <code>require</code> which allows you to evaluate the file within the context of an anonymous module. But, of course, using the namespace operator <code>::</code> the code in the file can <em>still</em> get access to the global namespace and every module and class in it, by just doing something like <code>class ::String; def length; 42 end end</code>.</p>

<p>Now, if the gem author published his gem as a <code>refine</code>ment, then you would <em>at least</em> be able to limit the effects to a single script body:</p>

<p><code>string_with_upper_reverse.rb</code>:</p>

<pre><code>module UpperReverse
  def reverse
    super.upcase
  end
end

module StringWithUpperReverse
  refine String do
    prepend UpperReverse
  end
end

puts 'Hello'.reverse
# olleH

using StringWithUpperReverse

puts 'Hello'.reverse
# OLLEH
</code></pre>

<p><code>test.rb</code>:</p>

<pre><code>puts 'Hello'.reverse
# olleH

require_relative 'string_with_upper_reverse'

puts 'Hello'.reverse
# olleH

using StringWithUpperReverse

puts 'Hello'.reverse
# OLLEH

require_relative 'required'
</code></pre>

<p><code>required.rb</code>:</p>

<pre><code>puts 'Hello'.reverse
# olleH

using StringWithUpperReverse

puts 'Hello'.reverse
# OLLEH
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, neither <code>require</code>ing nor being <code>require</code>d by a script which is <code>using</code> the <code>refine</code>ment will mean that the <code>refine</code>ment is visible inside your script. <em>Only</em> explicitly <code>using</code> the <code>refine</code>ment inside a script body will make the <code>refine</code>ment visible <em>only</em> from that point on and <em>only</em> within that <em>one</em> script body.</p>

<p>Note, however, that <code>refine</code>ments are an experimental feature: their API may change without notice in future versions of Ruby, they may even be removed altogether.</p>

<p>Note also that the version of <code>refine</code>ments that ships with Ruby 2.0.0 (and also current development versions of Ruby 2.1) can <em>only</em> be scoped to script bodies. The ability to be scoped to <code>module</code> and <code>class</code> bodies was removed shortly prior to the release of Ruby 2.0.0, together with the <code>Module#using</code> method.</p>

<p>And lastly, note that <code>Object#send</code> ignores <code>refine</code>ments:</p>

<pre><code>require_relative 'string_with_upper_reverse'

using StringWithUpperReverse

puts 'Hello'.reverse
# OLLEH

puts 'Hello'.send(:reverse)
# olleH
</code></pre>

"<p>Do Eigenclasses exist prior to a singleton method being defined
on a Object or Class. ie Do they always exist or come in existence
when a singleton method or class method in defined?</p>
","2988","","<p><em>Every</em> object <em>always</em> has a singleton class. Period. No ifs, no buts, no exceptions.</p>

<p>Depending on how clever the compiler or interpreter is, it may or may not perform some performance optimizations. But like all performance optimizations, those are not allowed to change the result of the program, so even if those performance optimizations <em>do</em> lead to certain states where a particular singleton class does <em>not actually</em> exist, the program still <em>must</em> behave as if it <em>did</em> exist, so you wouldn't be able to tell anyway. After all, that's pretty much the <em>definition</em> of ""performance optimization"".</p>

<p>Some Ruby implementations may do some optimizations, others may do other optimizations, some may even not do any optimizations <em>at all</em>. You can't tell from the result of your program, and you shouldn't care, you <em>mustn't</em> care.</p>

<p>For example, YARV performs the following optimizations:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Since almost no object has singleton methods, creating a singleton class for <em>every</em> object would be a waste of memory, therefore singleton classes are created lazily: when you create a singleton method (<code>def foo.bar</code> or <code>Object#define_singleton_method</code>), when you open up the singleton class (<code>class &lt;&lt; foo</code>), and when you ask for an object's singleton class (<code>Object#singleton_class</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>Since almost every class has some sort of class method, the overhead of lazily creating a singleton class doesn't make sense, so for classes, the singleton class is always created eagerly.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>But this is a private internal implementation detail of YARV. JRuby may do it differently. IronRuby may do it differently. MacRuby may do it differently. MRuby may do it differently. Topaz may do it differently. Rubinius may do it differently. MagLev may do it differently. Even the next patchlevel of YARV may do it differently.</p>

<p>If you look at the singleton class it's there. If you <em>don't</em> look at it, it doesn't matter whether it's there. So, semantically, it's always there.</p>

","2988","","<p>In the REPL, every statement you type will be wrapped inside of an object which is nested inside the object of the previous statement. This is done specifically so that you can ""change"" the value of <code>val</code>s or <code>class</code>es or <code>trait</code>s later. Otherwise you would have to restart the REPL and retype every statement everytime you make a typo.</p>

<p>So, your REPL session is (roughly) compiled to something like this:</p>

  }
  val _ = Line2 // force creating the Line2 object

"<p>In some situations, one generally uses a large enough integer value to represent infinity. I usually use the largest representable positive/negative integer. That usually yields more code, since you need to check if one of the operands is infinity before virtually all arithmetic operations in order to avoid overflows. Sometimes it would be desirable to have saturated integer arithmetic. For that reason, some people use smaller values for infinity, that can be added or multiplied several times without overflow.

<pre><code>a = min(INF, b + c);

","2988","","<p>Calling <code>GC.start</code> or <code>ObjectSpace.garbage_collect</code> <em>does not</em> mean that a garbage collection will be performed. It's only a hint to the Ruby runtime.</p>

<p>On some platforms it isn't even <em>possible</em> for the Ruby runtime to initiate a garbage collection, because the garbage collector isn't even part of the Ruby runtime, e.g on JRuby or IronRuby.</p>

<p>In general, the Ruby runtime will decide on its own when it will perform a garbage collection. Usually, that's when it runs out of memory. 100000 modules aren't <em>that</em> big, so there's simply no need to perform a GC cycle.</p>

<p>Also, most Ruby implementations will <em>never</em> release memory back to the OS, even after a GC cycle.</p>

<p>So, just the fact that the <code>ObjectSpace</code> doesn't shrink doesn't necessarily mean that you have memory leak. It could simply mean that the Ruby runtime didn't yet deem it necessary to run a GC cycle.</p>

<p>Also note that if you run this code from IRb, Pry, an IDE console or some other non-standard environment, then it may be the case that <em>those</em> hold on to some of those modules. For example, Pry stores the results of the last 100 commands in a history array. (Try evaluating <code>_out_[5]</code> in Pry, after entering your example program.)</p>

<p>Question:
I know that the java version here is not much flexible as Ruby.Is there anything similar in Java that I can do to achieve the level of flexibility like ruby does provides?</p>
","2988","","<p>First, a word of caution: that code is absolutely horrible. It provides almost no encapsulation, it leaks implementation details left and right, there's no way that a <code>Tree</code> object can maintain its own invariants or state. Secondly, it doesn't integrate <em>at all</em> with Ruby's collection framework.</p>

<p>As a consequence, my Java translation is <em>also</em> equally horrible, and it <em>also</em> doesn't integrate with Java's collection framework.</p>

<p>The two biggest drawbacks that your Java code has compared to your Ruby are</p>

<ul>
<li>in the Java version, the element type is hard-coded to <code>String</code>, whereas in the Ruby version, it can be <em>any</em> object, and even a mixture of objects within the same tree, and </li>
<li>in the Java version, the iterators are hard-coded to printing the name(s), whereas in the Ruby version, the iterators take a block argument with the code to execute.</li>
</ul>

<p>The first problem cannot be easily solved in Java. You can make the collection generic, so that it can hold elements of any type, but making it heterogeneous (i.e. being able to hold elements of different types in the same collection) is going to be <em>a lot of</em> work. So, I stuck with the partial solution: making the <code>Tree</code> generic.</p>

<p>The second problem can be solved by having the iterators take an object which contains the code. After all, a first-class subroutine is basically the same as an object with only one method. (Java 8 is going to take some of that pain away, I included examples in the code.)</p>

<li>CPython is an implementation of the Python programming language which has a Python compiler.</li>
<li>PyPy is an implementation of the Python programming language which has a Python compiler.</li>
<li>Jython is an implementation of the Python programming language which has a Python compiler.</li>
<li>IronPython is an implementation of the Python programming language which has a Python compiler.</li>
<li>Pynie is an implementation of the Python programming language which has a Python compiler.</li>
<li>YARV is an implementation of the Ruby programming language which has a Ruby compiler.</li>
<li>Rubinius is an implementation of the Ruby programming language which has a Ruby compiler.</li>
<li>MacRuby is an implementation of the Ruby programming language which has a Ruby compiler.</li>
<li>JRuby is an implementation of the Ruby programming language which has a Ruby compiler.</li>
<li>IronRuby is an implementation of the Ruby programming language which has a Ruby compiler.</li>
<li>MagLev is an implementation of the Ruby programming language which has a Ruby compiler.</li>
<li>Quercus is an implementation of the PHP programming language which has a PHP compiler.</li>
<li>P8 is an implementation of the PHP programming language which has a PHP compiler.</li>
<li>V8 is an implementation of the ECMAScript programming language which has an ECMAScript compiler.</li>
</ul>

<p>In general, <em>every</em> language can be implemented by a compiler, and <em>every</em> language can be implemented by an interpreter. It is also possible to <em>automatically</em> derive a compiler from an interpreter and vice-versa.</p>

<p>Most modern language implementations use both interpretation and compilation, sometimes even several compilers. Take Rubinius, for example: first Ruby code is compiled to Rubinius bytecode. Rubinius bytecode is then interpreted by the Rubinius VM. Code which has been interpreted several times is then compiled to Rubinius Compiler IR, which is then compiled to LLVM IR, which is then compiled to ""native code"" (whatever that is). So, Rubinius has one interpreter and three compilers.</p>

<p>V8 is a different example. It actually has <em>no</em> interpreter, but two different compilers: one very fast, very memory-efficient compiler which produces unoptimized, somewhat slow code. Code which has been run multiple times is then thrown away, and compiled again with the second compiler, which produces aggressively optimized code but takes more time and uses more memory during compilation.</p>

<p>However, in the end, you <em>cannot</em> run code without an interpreter. A compiler cannot run code. A compiler translates a program from one language into a different language. That's it. You can translate all you want, in the end, <em>something</em> has to run the code, and that thing is an interpreter. It might be implemented in software or in silicon, but it still is an interpreter.</p>

","2988","","<p>There are two differences:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>When you use a mixin, there is a clear place where your ""patch"" methods can live.

(I could try <code>source_location</code> as well, but that is not always reliable.)</p></li>
<li><p>Mixing in a module into a class makes the module the superclass of the class it is being mixed into. So, if there already is a <code>my_new_method</code> defined in <code>TimeEntryQuery</code>, your first option will overwrite it, whereas in your second option, your method will become the <code>super</code> method of that method.

The graph for Coffeescript looks like this:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/4M9PN.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I wanted to make such a graph for PHP using <a href=""http://php.net/manual/en/tokens.php"" rel=""nofollow"">the parser tokens</a> as a starting point (to make sure I don't miss anything and because I'm lazy). I was wondering if there is something similar to these tokens in other in other interpreted languages (Python, Ruby, etc.) and compiled languages (the C family, Java, etc.).</p>

<p>Findings thus far:</p>

","2988","","<p>There is no such thing as a list of tokens for a language. Tokens are a property of the parser (more precisely: they are a property of the interface between the lexer and the parser), not the language. A different parser parsing the same language may use a completely different set of tokens. Many modern parsers are lexerless which means they don't have tokens <em>at all</em>.</p>

<p>In Ruby, for example, Melbourne (the parser used by Rubinius) uses a very different set of tokens than RedParse/RubyLexer (used by all sorts of projects) which again uses a very different set of tokens than the ANTLR-based parser used by XRuby and Sapphire in Steel.</p>

"<p>Much is written about the advantages of immutable state, but are there common cases in Scala where it makes sense to prefer mutable classes?  (This is a Scala newbie question from someone with a background in ""classic"" OOP design using mutable classes.)</p>

<p>For something trivial like a 3-dimensional Point class, I get the advantages of immutability.  But what about something like a Motor class, which exposes a variety of control variables and/or sensor readings?  Would a seasoned Scala developer typically write such a class to be immutable?  In that case, would 'speed' be represented internally as a 'val' instead of a 'var', and the 'setSpeed' method return a new instance of the class?  Similarly, would every new reading from a sensor describing the motor's internal state cause a new instance of Motor to be instantiated?</p>

<p>The ""old way"" of doing OOP in Java or C# using classes to encapsulate mutable state seems to fit the Motor example very well.  So I'm curious to know if once you gain experience using the immutable-state paradigm, you would even design a class like Motor to be immutable.</p>
","2988","","<p>I'll use a different, classic, OO modeling example: bank accounts.</p>

<p>These are used in practically every OO course on the planet, and the design you usually end up with is something like this:</p>

<pre><code>class Account(var balance: BigDecimal) {
  def transfer(amount: BigDecimal, to: Account): Unit = { 
    balance -= amount
    to.balance += amount
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>IOW: the balance is <em>data</em>, and the transfer is an <em>operation</em>. (Note also that the transfer is a <em>complex</em> operation involving multiple mutable objects, which however should be <em>atomic</em>, not complex … so you need locking etc.)</p>

<p>However, that is <em>wrong</em>. That's not how banking systems are actually designed. In fact, that's not how actual <em>real-world</em> (physical) banking works, either. Actual physical banking and actual banking systems work like this:</p>

<pre><code>class Account(implicit transactionLog: TransactionLog) {
  def balance = transactionLog.foldLeft(_ + _)
}

class TransactionSlip(from: Account, to: Account, amount: BigDecimal)
</code></pre>

<p>IOW: the balance is an <em>operation</em> and the transfer is <em>data</em>. Note that everything here is immutable. The balance is just a left fold of the transaction log.</p>

<p>Note also that we didn't even end up with a purely functional, immutable design as an explicit design goal. We just wanted to model the banking system correctly and ended up with a purely functional, immutable design by coincidence. (Well, it's actually not by coincidence. There's a reason why real-world banking works that way, and it has the same benefits as it has in programming: mutable state and side-effects make systems complex and confusing … and in banking that means money disappearing.)</p>

<p>The point here is that the exact same problem can be modeled in very different ways, and depending on the model, you might up with something which is trivial to make purely immutable or very hard.</p>

  # return new instance
end

def foo!
  replace(foo)
  nil # or self

<p>Conversely, all objects have a method which creates a duplicate copy with identical internal state, called <code>dup</code>. You can implement the non-destructive version in terms of <code>dup</code> and the destructive version:</p>

  nil # or self

def foo
  dup.foo!

<p>It is not possible to make calling <code>Proc</code>s look like calling methods, because there is an ambiguity: does <code>b(1, 2, 3)</code> mean ""call method <code>b</code> with arguments <code>1, 2, 3</code>"" or does it mean ""call method <code>b</code> without arguments (or dereference local variable <code>b</code>) and call the <code>Proc</code> returned by <code>b</code> with arguments <code>1, 2, 3</code>""? In ECMAScript and Python, this works because they simply don't allow calling methods without parentheses, so this ambiguity never arises.</p>

","2988","","<p>Methods aren't objects, therefore you cannot store anything in them.</p>

<p>You <em>can</em> obtain a proxy object for a bound method using the <code>Object#method</code> method and for an unbound method using the <code>Module#instance_method</code> method, but that proxy object is, well, just a proxy object. In particular, it is not guaranteed that you will always get the same proxy object when you ask for one.</p>

<p>So, if you obtain a proxy object for a method, then store some documentation in it, then later obtain another proxy object for the same method, this might be a different proxy object which doesn't have your documentation in it.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>class UnboundMethod
  attr_accessor :doc
end

map = Array.instance_method(:map)

map.doc = '`map` maps a block over all elements'

map_again = Array.instance_method(:map)

map_again.doc
# =&gt; nil

map.doc
# =&gt; '`map` maps a block over all elements'

map.object_id == map_again.object_id
# =&gt; false
</code></pre>

<p>So, you cannot store your documentation in the method, because methods aren't objects and you cannot store it in the proxy object, because Ruby doesn't guarantee the identity of those proxy objects.</p>

<p>You need to store it somewhere else. Maybe in the <code>Module</code> the method is defined in, indexed by the method name.</p>

<p>What you are seeing is simply shared mutable state: if an object is mutable, it can be mutated, and if that object is visible through multiple references, then that mutation will be visible through multiple references. Simple as that. It doesn't matter if you call me ""Jörg"" like my friends do or ""son"" like my mom does, if I cut my hair, <em>both</em> of you will see that.</p>

<p>If you don't want your objects to be mutated, you need to make them immutable. For example:</p>

  attr_writer :name

  def initialize(name)

puts jack.name
# Jack the Ripper

jack.name.replace('Bob')

puts jack.name
# Bob
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to protect against <em>that</em>, you need to make sure that all the objects referenced by your <code>Person</code> objects are <em>also</em> immutable. For example like this:</p>

    self.name = name.freeze
  end
end

jack = Person.new('Jack)

jack.name &lt;&lt; 'the Ripper'

<p>Now, your <code>Person</code> objects are <em>truly</em> immutable. (At least as ""truly"" as can be in a language with such powerful reflection capabilities as Ruby.)</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we have now done to someone else the very same thing we are trying to protect ourselves against: we are mutating <em>their</em> objects!

","2988","","<blockquote>
  <p>Just for cosmetic reasons, I'd like to provide a syntax for object instantiation from some of my classes, without the keyword 'new'.</p>

<p><code>new</code> isn't a keyword. It's a method just like any other method. And you don't have to call it <code>new</code>, you can call it anything you like. For example, you can call it <code>call</code>:</p>

<pre><code>class Foo
  def initialize(val)
    puts ""Initialized with #{val}!""
  end

  class &lt;&lt; self; alias_method :call, :new end
end

foo = Foo.(42)
# Initialized with 42!
</code></pre>

<p>In Ruby, implementing <code>call</code> is equivalent to saying ""this is a function"". Anything which implements <code>call</code> is basically a function or can be treated as one. And if you think of <code>Class</code>es as factory functions for objects, then it even makes sense to do this.</p>

<p>If you think of <code>Class</code>es as functions, then you should also implement <code>to_proc</code> so that you can use them in place of blocks:</p>

<pre><code>class &lt;&lt; Foo
  def to_proc
    -&gt; var { new(var) }
  end
end

[23, 42].map(&amp;Foo)
# Initialized with 23!
# Initialized with 42!
# =&gt; [#&lt;Foo:0xdeadbeef081523&gt;, #&lt;Foo:0xdeadbeef081542&gt;]
</code></pre>

<p>In fact, you could do it globally:</p>

<pre><code>class Class
  alias_method :call, :new

  def to_proc
    -&gt; (*args, &amp;block) { new(*args, &amp;block) }
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Or you can call your factory method <code>[]</code>:</p>

<pre><code>class &lt;&lt; Foo; alias_method :[], :new end

foo = Foo[42]
# Initialized with 42!
</code></pre>

<p>In fact, this latter one is common practice for anything collection-like: <code>Array</code> and <code>Hash</code> from the core library, <code>Set</code>, <code>SortedSet</code> and <code>Matrix</code> from the standard library have such factory methods.</p>

<p>Another possibility is to define a method on <code>Kernel</code> with the same name as your class:</p>

<pre><code>module Kernel
  private

  def Foo(obj)
    Foo.new(obj)
  end
end

Foo(42)
# Initialized with 42!
</code></pre>

<p>Note, however, that this pattern is usually reserved for conversion methods that convert an object to an object of a different class unless that object is already of that class (see <code>Kernel#Array</code>, <code>Kernel#Integer</code> etc. for examples).</p>

<p>So, you would rather implement it like this (if at all):</p>

<pre><code>module Kernel
  private

  def Foo(obj)
    return obj if obj.is_a?(Foo)

    begin
      return obj.to_foo
    rescue NoMethodError =&gt; e
      return Foo.new(obj) if e.name == 'to_foo'
      raise

","2988","","<p>Blocks aren't objects, so you can't do anything useful with them (except <code>yield</code> to them, of course).</p>

<p>I mean, there's no way to refer to them, they aren't even bound to a name:</p>

<pre><code>def foo
  yield 'foo'
end

foo do |bar| puts bar end
# foo
</code></pre>

<p>Inside <code>foo</code>, the block isn't bound to any variable, you cannot even refer to it, so you obviously cannot query it about its parameters either.</p>

<p>You <em>can</em> however ask Ruby to convert the block to a <code>Proc</code> and bind it to a parameter. Then, you can refer to it by name, <em>and</em> you have the full <code>Proc</code> API at your disposal, including <code>Proc#parameters</code>:</p>

<pre><code>def foo(&amp;blk)
  blk.parameters
end

foo do |m1, m2, o1=:o1, o2=:o2, *splat, m3, m4, 
      ok1: :ok1, mk1:, mk2:, ok2: :ok2, **ksplat, &amp;blk| end
# =&gt; [[:opt, :m1],
#     [:opt, :m2],
#     [:opt, :o1],
#     [:opt, :o2],
#     [:rest, :splat],
#     [:opt, :m3],
#     [:opt, :m4],
#     [:keyreq, :mk1],
#     [:keyreq, :mk2],
#     [:key, :ok1],
#     [:key, :ok2],
#     [:keyrest, :ksplat],
#     [:block, :blk]]
</code></pre>

<p>However, note that the idea of ""arity of a block"" is a hairy concept in Ruby, because of the loose parameter binding semantics of blocks. Parameter binding semantics of blocks are different than the parameter binding semantics of methods, in particular when it comes to arity:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the block only takes a single parameter, but multiple arguments are passed, that's not an error, instead the arguments are passed as a single <code>Array</code> bound to the parameter (as if the parameter had been declared as a <code>*splat</code> parameter).</li>
<li>If the block takes multiple parameters, but only a single argument is passed, that argument is converted to an <code>Array</code> and its individual elements are passed as arguments instead (as if they had been passed as a <code>*splat</code> argument).</li>
<li>If more arguments are passed than the block takes parameters, the extra arguments are ignored.</li>
<li>If fewer arguments are passed than the block takes parameters, the extra parameters are bound to <code>nil</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>All in all, the semantics are closer to that of assignments than method calls.</p>

<p>For example, you will note that even though <code>m1</code> and <code>m2</code> are declared as mandatory positional parameters in the block, <code>Proc#parameters</code> lists their type as <code>:opt</code>, i.e. optional parameters.</p>

<p>In other words: even a block that declares only one parameter still takes two arguments, and a block that declares two parameters can be invoked with just one argument.</p>

<p>One example where this is useful: the entire <code>Enumerable</code> mixin is based on methods that <code>yield</code> a <em>single</em> element. However, for <code>Hash</code>, you <em>really</em> want to deal with <em>two</em> arguments, <code>key, value</code>. And you <em>can</em>, because <code>Hash#each</code> <code>yield</code>s an <code>Array</code> of two elements, and a block that declares two parameters but only receives one argument will ""splat"" that argument across its parameters, so that you end up with the key bound to <code>key</code> and the value bound to <code>value</code> without having to copy&amp;paste two-argument versions of all of <code>Enumerable</code>s methods.</p>

I've used this answer <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/373419/whats-the-difference-between-passing-by-reference-vs-passing-by-value"">What&#39;s the difference between passing by reference vs. passing by value?</a> and according to it, Ruby seems to be, well, a hybrid...</p>

<p>Technically, Ruby seems to be 'pass by value' with the difference that the value doesn't get COPIED when you pass it to a method. If we define ""value"" = the object, and ""reference"" = the reference variable that points to that object, will ""pass by reference"" makes sense if it's equivalent to ""pass the reference variable that points to a specific object""? And then, once the ""reference"" is passed, the method doesn't make a COPY of the object, but actually has the ORIGINAL object itself (referenced by the variable) which can manipulate directly. Correct me if I'm wrong.</p>

<p>EDIT: I am AWARE of this question <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1872110/is-ruby-pass-by-reference-or-by-value"">Is Ruby pass by reference or by value?</a> but different people seem to have different definitions of pass by reference/value there.</p>
","2988","","<p>Ruby is pass-by-value, just like C, Java, Python, Smalltalk, ECMAScript and many others. C++ and C# are also pass-by-value by default, you have to use special annotations (<code>&amp;</code> in C++, <code>ref</code> in C#), to use pass-by-reference.</p>

<p>The distinction is actually rather simple: if the the reference is passed, then the callee can modify it, otherwise it can't. In Ruby, the callee <em>cannot</em> modify the reference, ergo it is pass-by-value:</p>

<pre><code>def is_ruby_pass_by_value?(foo)
  foo = 'No, Ruby is pass-by-reference.'
  return nil
end

bar = 'Yes, of course, Ruby *is* pass-by-value!'

is_ruby_pass_by_value?(bar)

p bar
# 'Yes, of course, Ruby *is* pass-by-value!'
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, within the method <code>is_ruby_pass_by_value?</code>, the reference <code>bar</code>/<code>foo</code> is <em>not</em> being passed, otherwise the modification would be visible afterwards. <code>bar</code> is being passed by-value, i.e. the <em>content</em> of <code>bar</code> (the <em>value</em> contained in it) is being passed and <em>not</em> the reference itself.</p>

<p>Now, what <em>is</em> the value that is being passed? It is <em>not</em> the <code>String</code> object. Rather it is a <em>pointer</em> to that <code>String</code> object. More precisely: a <em>copy</em> of that pointer.</p>

<p>Now, there are <em>two</em> pointers to that <code>String</code> object. And that <code>String</code> object is mutable! So, if I follow one pointer (<code>foo</code>) and tell that <code>String</code> object to change itself, and then I follow the other pointer (<code>bar</code>) and ask it about its contents, then I will obviously see the <em>changed</em> contents. That's just the nature of shared mutable state, Ruby is not a purely functional, referentially transparent language:</p>

<pre><code>def is_ruby_pass_by_value?(foo)
  foo.replace('More precisely, it is call-by-object-sharing!')
  foo = 'No, Ruby is pass-by-reference.'
  return nil
end

bar = 'Yes, of course, Ruby *is* pass-by-value!'

is_ruby_pass_by_value?(bar)

p bar
# 'More precisely, it is call-by-object-sharing!'
</code></pre>

<p>In fact, in Ruby, the value being held by variables and being passed as arguments is <em>always</em> a pointer. That's how almost all object-oriented languages work. Barbara Liskov called this special case of pass-by-value ""call-by-object-sharing"", it is also sometimes called ""call-by-sharing"" or ""call-by-object"".</p>

<p>Note, however, that the fact that the value being passed is a pointer, is <em>completely</em> irrelevant. Pass-by-value vs. pass-by-reference is about <em>how</em> arguments are being passed, not <em>what</em> the argument is. C is always pass-by-value, regardless of whether you are passing an <code>int</code> or a pointer. Pointers are still being passed by value. Likewise in Ruby, pointers are being passed by value. The differences between Ruby and C are a) that you can <em>only</em> pass pointers in Ruby, and b) that there is no special syntax indicating that you are passing a pointer.</p>

<p>[Note: most Ruby implementations will actually have optimizations in place for passing objects which are smaller than a pointer directly instead of passing a pointer to that object. However, they only do that for objects which are guaranteed by the language specification to be deeply immutable, so that it is impossible to observe the difference between passing a pointer to the value and passing the value directly. This is done, for example, for <code>Fixnum</code>s, <code>Symbol</code>s, <code>Float</code>s, <code>nil</code>, <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>.]</p>

<p>Here is an example in C#, that demonstrates the difference between pass-by-value (even if that value is a reference) and pass-by-reference:</p>

<pre><code>class Program
{
    static void IsCSharpPassByValue(string[] foo, ref string baz)
    {
        foo[0] = ""More precisely, for reference types it is call-by-object-sharing, which is a special case of pass-by-value."";
        foo = new string[] { ""C# is not pass-by-reference."" };

        baz = ""It also supports pass-by-reference if explicitly requested."";
    }

    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        var quux = new string[] { ""Yes, of course, C# *is* pass-by-value!"" };

        var grault = ""This string will vanish because of pass-by-reference."";

        IsCSharpPassByValue(quux, ref grault);

        Console.WriteLine(quux[0]);
        // More precisely, for reference types it is call-by-object-sharing, which is a special case of pass-by-value.

        Console.WriteLine(grault);
        // It also supports pass-by-reference if explicitly requested.
    }

"<p>I'm trying to learn Scala and the Play Framework at the same time.  Scala looks to me like it has a lot of really cool ideas, but one of my frustrations is trying to understand all of the different syntaxes for methods/functions/lambdas/anonymous functions/etc.</p>

<p>So I have my main application controller like so:</p>

<pre><code>object Application extends Controller {
  def index = Action {
    Ok(views.html.index(""Your new application is ready.""))
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This tells me I have a singleton <code>Application</code> that has one method, <code>index</code>, that returns what type??  I was expecting <code>index</code> to have a definition more like:</p>

<pre><code>def index(req: Request) : Result = { ... }
</code></pre>

<p>Looking at Play Framework's documentation, it looks as though <code>Action</code> is a trait, that transforms a request to a result, by I'm having a hard time understanding what this line is saying:</p>

<pre><code>def index = Action { ... }
</code></pre>

<p>I come from a Java background, so I don't know what this is saying?  (this statement <em>feels</em> like it's saying ""method index = [some interface Action]"", which doesn't make sense to me; it seems something beautiful is happening, but it is magic to me, and I feel uneasy with magic in my code ;))</p>
","2988","","<p>When you invoke an object as if it were a function, that's translated into a call to <code>apply</code>. I.e.:</p>

<pre><code>foo(bar)
</code></pre>

<p>is translated into </p>

<pre><code>foo.apply(bar)
</code></pre>

<p>So, inside <code>index</code> you are calling the <code>Action</code> object as if it were a function, which means you are <em>actually</em> calling <code>Action.apply</code>.</p>

<p>The return type of <code>index</code> is omitted because the compiler can infer it to be the return type of <code>Action.apply</code> (which I guess from the name is <code>Unit</code>).</p>

<p>And I get an  block in initialize': undefined method `talk' for # (NoMethodError)</p>

<p>Isn't send supposed to be doing something like:</p>

<p><code>dog.talk = bruuuf</code> Why is not letting me do so? Also, this would not set an instance variable, but it would create an instance method. Right?</p>
","2988","","<p>First off: you cannot set instance variables with <a href=""http://Ruby-Doc.Org/core-2.1.0/Object.html#method-i-send"" rel=""nofollow""><code>Object#send</code></a>. <code>Object#send</code> sends messages, it doesn't set instance variables. Of course, you can send a message which may or may not then in turn invoke a method which may or may not in turn then set an instance variable, but that's not the doing of <code>Object#send</code>, it's the doing of whatever method was invoked in response to the message you sent.</p>

<p>If you want to dynamically set instance variables, use <a href=""http://Ruby-Doc.Org/core-2.1.0/Object.html#method-i-instance_variable_set"" rel=""nofollow""><code>Object#instance_variable_set</code></a>:</p>

<p>In this case, however, it looks like you don't actually want to set an instance variable but rather call a setter method. Setter methods have names that end with an <code>=</code> sign, e.g. <code>Dog#talk=</code>:</p>

","2988","","<p>Ruby is pass-by-value. Always. No exceptions. You cannot do pass-by-reference in Ruby.</p>

"<p>Ruby <code>Module</code> has a method <code>instance_methods</code> that can return a list of methods of that class. But how to retrieve class methods list of a class?</p>
","2988","","<p>The first thing you need to know is that there is no such thing as a class method in Ruby.

","2988","","<p>The main distinction between an <code>Enumerator</code> and all other data structures in the Ruby core library (<code>Array</code>, <code>Hash</code>) and standard library (<code>Set</code>, <code>SortedSet</code>) is that an <code>Enumerator</code> can be <em>infinite</em>. You cannot have an <code>Array</code> of all even numbers or a stream of zeroes or all prime numbers, but you can definitely have such an <code>Enumerator</code>:</p>

<pre><code>evens = Enumerator.new do |y|
  i = -2
  y &lt;&lt; i += 2 while true

<p>So, what can you do with such an <code>Enumerator</code>? Well, three things, basically.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><code>Enumerator</code> mixes in <code>Enumerable</code>. Therefore, you can use all <code>Enumerable</code> methods such as <code>map</code>, <code>inject</code>, <code>all?</code>, <code>any?</code>, <code>none?</code>, <code>select</code>, <code>reject</code> and so forth. Just be aware that an <code>Enumerator</code> may be infinite whereas <code>map</code> returns an <code>Array</code>, so trying to <code>map</code> an infinite <code>Enumerator</code> may create an infinitely large <code>Array</code> and take an infinite amount of time.</p></li>
<li><p>There are wrapping methods which somehow ""enrich"" an <code>Enumerator</code> and return a new <code>Enumerator</code>. For example, <code>Enumerator#with_index</code> adds a ""loop counter"" to the block and <code>Enumerator#with_object</code> adds a memo object.</p></li>
<li><p>You can use an <code>Enumerator</code> just like you would use it in other languages for external iteration by using the <code>Enumerator#next</code> method which will give you either the next value (and move the <code>Enumerator</code> forward) or <code>raise</code> a <code>StopIteration</code> exception if the <code>Enumerator</code> is finite and you have reached the end.</p></li>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p><strong>UPDATED:</strong>
Thank you all very much. I have read and tested a lot, so will leave a few considerations. I leave this for future reference and as so, i hope the Ruby experts can correct me if i am wrong. I realised that class &lt;&lt;  Self refers to the Self singleton class. So, the idiomatic class &lt;&lt; abcd, starts the abcd singleton class context. I realised also that the hierarchy of a class singleton class is different from an object singleton class. The hierarchy of a class singleton class follows all singleton classes on a hierarchy. In this case:</p>

<p>singleton Self->singleton Object->Singleton basicobject ->class->module->object->kernel->basicObject </p>

<p>The object singleton class lies in a different kind of hierarchy:</p>

<p>Object singleton->Self->Object->kernel->basicObject</p>

<p>This explains this outputs.</p>
","2988","","<p>In Ruby, every object has a singleton class. This singleton class has only one instance: the object it belongs to.</p>

<p>Since the singleton class has only ever one instance, and every object has its own singleton class, methods that are defined in this class can only be called on <em>that</em> specific object. Those methods are typically called <em>singleton methods</em>, although that is misleading: there's nothing special about those methods, they are just normal standard instance methods.</p>

<p>Here's an example:</p>

<pre><code>foo, bar, baz = Object.new, Object.new, Object.new

class &lt;&lt; foo; def quux; :foo end end
class &lt;&lt; bar; def quux; :bar end end

foo.quux # =&gt; :foo
bar.quux # =&gt; :bar
baz.quux # NoMethodError
</code></pre>

<p>Classes are just objects like any other object. So, just like any other object, they have singleton classes. Methods defined in the singleton class of an object that happens to be a class are typically called <em>class methods</em>, although again, there's nothing special about them, they are just singleton methods of an object which happens to be a class, which in turn means they are just regular instance methods of a singleton class which belongs to an object which happens to be a class.</p>

<p>So, if you compare this to something like Java, you can see a duality: in Java, there is only one kind of class but there are two kinds of methods (instance and static). In Ruby, there is only one kind of method (instance) but it can be defined in different kinds of classes (regular and singleton).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I find this kinda complex so I would like to understand what does the operator &lt;&lt; do in this context</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's just the syntax for opening up a singleton class as opposed to opening up a class.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>and what is possible to put on both ends.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, on the left has to be the keyword <code>class</code> and on the right any expression that returns an object.</p>

<p>The Ruby Language Specification also does not prescribe any particular performance characteristics for any methods of the <code>Array</code> class.</p>

<p><em>However</em>, Ruby programmers have come to expect certain performance guarantees from certain <code>Array</code> methods (and any implementation that doesn't meet those guarantees will simply be ignored by the community), e.g. </p>

<li>… and so on.</li>
</ul>

<p>Basically, the typical performance guarantees you would expect from a dynamic array.</p>

<p>This more or less means that the only way to meet those performance guarantees is that the implementation must use contiguous storage and exponential resizing.</p>

"<p>I'm currently running a project where we program in both Java, JavasSript and PHP.
Is it possible to write tests for the different pieces of the program/different langauges in the same language/framework? So that you can simply press Run on the tests once instead of installing three frameworks and running each of the frameworks once (once for Java, once for PHP and once for JavaScript)?</p>
","2988","","<p>Yes, that is possible.</p>

<p>One way would be to write a custom test driver for your testing framework of choice, which generates tests in the target language and runs them. I know of one company which did that for an embedded project. They wrote their tests in Ruby using the RSpec testing framework, but they actually replaced most of the RSpec machinery so that instead of running the tests <em>as-is</em> in Ruby, it would actually generate tests in C and run them against a mocked up version of their hardware, or even automatically upload them to the robot and run them there.</p>

<p>Another way would be to run all three languages on the same platform and use a testing framework for that platform. For example, you could run your PHP code on the JVM (using Quercus or P8) and your JavaScript code on the JVM (using dyn.js, Rhino or Nashorn) and then test all three using JUnit.</p>

<p>But I don't understand Ruby's modules because they have functionality but they aren't interfaces (in that they define method bodies, so they are more akin to subclassing), but they aren't superclasses (because multiple inheritance is not done in Ruby).</p>

<p>Can someone help me understand the usage of modules in Ruby and possibly give an analogy to .NET?</p>

<p>EDIT: Seeing the 3 votes to close due to duplicate, I must clarify.
<strong>I am asking what is the relationship between classes and modules (given that classes implementing interfaces is <code>can-do</code> in .NET)</strong>. The 'duplicate' answer does NOT address that question.</p>
","2988","","<p>Modules can be used for two things in Ruby: as namespaces for constants and as mixins.</p>

<p>The namespace usage is quite similar to C# namespaces: a module can contain constants (and all constants are contained in modules, even if you don't explicitly see it, in which case they belong to <code>Object</code>) which are namespaced to that module. So, <code>Foo::BAR</code> and <code>Baz::BAR</code> are two different constants even though they have the same name.</p>

<p>Mixins are a bit trickier. One way to look at a mixin, is that <em>a mixin is a class which doesn't know its superclass</em> (or a class that is parameterized by its superclass). Okay, this sounds a bit convoluted. Let's look at an example.</p>

<p>Imagine, something like this were possible in C#:</p>

<pre><code>interface IEachable&lt;E&gt; {
  IEachable&lt;E&gt; Each(Action&lt;E&gt; block);
}

class Enumerable&lt;S, E&gt; : S where S : IEachable&lt;E&gt; {
  List&lt;T&gt; Map(Func&lt;E, T&gt; block) {
    var res = new List&lt;T&gt;();
    this.Each(e =&gt; {†res.Add(block(e));});
    return res;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So, you have a generic class <code>Enumerable</code> which inherits from its type parameter <code>S</code> (the superclass). This is actually a pretty accurate description of the <code>Enumerable</code> mixin in Ruby. Everytime you instantiate the generic class into a concrete type, it ends with a different superclass.</p>

<p>So, the <em>same</em> class appears <em>multiple</em> times in the inheritance hierarchy, each time with a <em>different</em> superclass, but always just <em>one</em>.</p>

<p>This is different from multiple inheritance, where the <em>same</em> class appears <em>once</em> in the inheritance hierarchy, with <em>multiple</em> superclasses.</p>

<p>This property, that the class always has just one superclass, is called <em>linearization</em> and it solves a lot of the problems that traditional multiple inheritance has, which are usually related to the fact that there are multiple possible paths between two classes in the inheritance DAG, whereas with mixin linearization, there is just an inheritance <em>tree</em>, so there is always just one possible path.</p>

<p>In particular, this is what happens, when you mix a module <code>M</code> into a class <code>C</code> with superclass <code>S</code>:</p>

<pre><code>module M; end

class C &lt; S
  include M
end
</code></pre>

<p>When you call <code>include</code>, Ruby will</p>

<ol>
<li>create a new class <code>M'</code> whose method table pointer, constant table pointer, class variable table pointer and instance variable table pointer point to <code>M</code>'s method table, constant table, class variable table and instance variable table</li>
<li>set <code>M'</code>'s superclass to <code>C</code>'s current superclass (i.e. <code>S</code>)</li>
<li>set <code>C</code>'s superclass to <code>M'</code></li>
</ol>

<p>So that the inheritance hierarchy now looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>C &lt; M' &lt; S
</code></pre>

<p>[Note: <em>Actually</em> <code>include</code> delegates to <code>append_features</code>, which really does the above work, and just like almost everything else in Ruby, you can actually alter this behavior by overriding <code>append_features</code>, but that is advanced meta-magic.]</p>

<p>So, what are the practical implications of having a class that can be used in multiple places in the inheritance hierarchy? Well, you can use it to implement common behavior for unrelated classes.</p>

<p>Again, look at the <code>Enumerable</code> mixin: it provides common behavior for any object that conforms to the following protocol: it must have an <code>each</code> method that <code>yield</code>s all elements one-by-one and returns <code>self</code>. That's it. There doesn't need to be any sort of inheritance relationship between the classes of those objects. All that is required is that they respond to <code>each</code> in an appropriate manner.</p>

<p>Which leads us to your question about interfaces: <em>that's</em> an interface. Although in Ruby, we usually call it <em>protocol</em>. Protocols in Ruby are very much like interfaces in C#, however, there is one crucial difference: there is no such thing as a protocol in Ruby. Protocols are <em>latent</em>, not <em>manifest</em>, they only exist in the programmer's head, in documentation, but <em>not</em> in the source code, and thus they cannot be checked by the language.</p>

","2988","","<p>There is nothing you can do beyond what you are already doing.

<p>Note, however, that there is a much bigger problem with your definitions of equality and ordering: they <em>aren't</em> equality or ordering!</p>

<p>Equality and ordering relationships need to be </p>

<ul>
<li>reflexive: a ~ a</li>
<li>symmetric: a ~ b &lt;=> b ~ a</li>
<li>transitive: a ~ b &amp;&amp; b ~ c => a ~ c</li>
</ul>

<p>Both your equality and ordering relations violate transitivity:</p>

<pre><code>one   = Element.new('Z', 1, 1)
two   = Element.new('A', 1, 1)
three = Element.new('A', 2, 2)

one == two   # =&gt; true
two == three # =&gt; true
one == three # =&gt; false # Huh?

one &lt;= two   # =&gt; true
two &lt;= three # =&gt; true
one &lt;= three # =&gt; false # Huh?

<p>The rewritten script works, however, it is really slow compared to the Python version (a ~40000-line text is processed in like not more than an hour, a Ruby script worked for hours for now, and it only processed like 15% of the text).</p>

<p>I wonder what could slow it down so much? Could it be that is because of the fact that i need to use ""active_support/core_ext"" to downcase Cyrillic text in Ruby? Could it be because I don't limit the processing in best_match using maxword? Maybe some other rewrite really messed the script up? Any insight will be really helpful for me.</p>
","2988","","<p>I didn't take a close look (there's just way too much code in your question to do a detailed examination, you really need to wittle it down to an <a href=""http://SSCCE.Org/"" rel=""nofollow"">SSCCE</a>), but a few things jumped out at me.</p>

<p>The most important one is that Language Implementations are designed to make idiomatic, well-factored, well-designed code run fast. Your code, however, looks more like Fortran than Ruby, it is definitely neither idiomatic Ruby nor well-factored.</p>

<p>Some smaller observations:</p>

<p>Here you are needlessly creating lots of string objects:</p>

<pre><code>answer &lt;&lt; letters[i] + ""\t"" + letters[i].mb_chars.downcase.to_s + \
  ""\t"" + char_type(letters[i]) + ""\t"" + i.to_s + ""|"" + word.length.to_s
</code></pre>

<p>You should prefer mutating a single string using <code>&lt;&lt;</code> over creating many temporary strings using <code>+</code>:</p>

<pre><code>answer &lt;&lt; ('' &lt;&lt; letters[i] &lt;&lt; ""\t"" &lt;&lt; letters[i].mb_chars.downcase.to_s &lt;&lt;
  ""\t"" &lt;&lt; char_type(letters[i]) &lt;&lt; ""\t"" &lt;&lt; i.to_s &lt;&lt; ""|"" &lt;&lt; word.length.to_s)
</code></pre>

<p>But really, string interpolation is much more idiomatic (and incidentally much faster):</p>

<pre><code>answer &lt;&lt; ""#{letters[i]}\t#{letters[i].mb_chars.downcase}\t#{char_type(letters[i])}\t#{i}|#{word.length}""
</code></pre>

<p>You have a lot of unnecessary <code>return</code>s in your code. Again, that is non-idiomatic, and also slower. For example here:</p>

<pre><code>def char_type(string)
  case string
  when /[[:punct:]]/
    return ""P""
  when /[[:digit:]]/
    return ""D""
  when /[A-z]/
    return ""F""
  when /[[:upper:]]/
    return ""U""
  else
    return ""R""
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>This should be written just</p>

<pre><code>def char_type(string)
  case string
  when /[[:punct:]]/
    ""P""
  when /[[:digit:]]/
    ""D""
  when /[A-z]/
    ""F""
  when /[[:upper:]]/
    ""U""
  else
    ""R""
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>There are other place with unnecessary <code>return</code>s as well.</p>

<p>Within your <code>infer_spaces</code> method you define another global method named <code>best_match</code>. Since <code>infer_spaces</code> is called by <code>test_to_vert</code>, which is called inside your <code>readlines</code> loop, the method will be defined over and over and over again for every line in the file, which means that (since most Ruby implementations nowadays are compiled), it will have to be compiled over and over and over and over again. Each redefinition will also invalidate all previous optimizations such as speculative inlining. Just move the method definition outside of the loop.</p>

<p><code>IO::readlines</code> reads the <em>entire</em> file into memory as an array. Then you iterate over the array. You might just as well iterate over the lines of the file directly, using <code>IO::foreach</code> instead:</p>

<pre><code>File.foreach(""test.txt"") do |line|
</code></pre>

<p>This will avoid loading the entire file into memory at once.</p>

<p>You didn't say which Ruby Implementation you are using. Since you have a fairly hot and tight loop, using an implementation with some sort of hotspot optimizations, polymorphic inline caching, speculative inlining, adaptive optimizations and so on, might make a big difference, especially if you fix the recompilation problem for <code>best_match</code>. Rubinius and JRuby are good candidates here. Rubinius, for example, has been demonstrated to be faster than hand-optimized C in certain cases!</p>

<p>Note: these are all just micro-optimizations. I didn't actually take a look at your algorithm. You can probably get much more performance by tweaking the algorithm rather than micro-optimize the implementation.</p>

<p>For example: in the Python implementation of <code>best_match</code>, you use <code>min</code> to find the minimum element, which is O(n), whereas in Ruby, you <code>sort</code> and then return the first element, which is O(n * log n).</p>

<p>It is <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/1732454/456814"">commonly expressed here on Stack Overflow</a> and in the developer
community that trying to parse HTML with regular expressions (""regexes"") is a
bad idea. To quote <a href=""http://blog.codinghorror.com/parsing-html-the-cthulhu-way/"" rel=""nofollow"">Jeff Atwood of Coding Horror</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So, while I may <em>attempt</em> to parse HTML using regular expressions <a href=""http://blog.codinghorror.com/programming-is-hard-lets-go-shopping/"" rel=""nofollow"">in certain
  situations</a>, I go in knowing that:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>It's generally a bad idea.</li>
  <li>Unless you have discipline and put very strict conditions on what you're
  doing, matching HTML with regular expressions rapidly devolves into madness,
  <em>just how Cthulhu likes it</em>.</li>
  <li>I had what I thought to be good, rational, (semi) defensible reasons for
  choosing regular expressions in this specific scenario.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h2>Reasons Why Regexes Are Bad for HTML Parsing</h2>

<p>Some of the reasons why seem to fall into these categories:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/1733489/456814"">You can't use it to parse arbitrary HTML</a>, because there are
known <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/702222/456814"">cases where a regular expression wouldn't work</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Regexes don't handle invalid HTML properly (is this just an example of point
#1 above?).</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/1758162/456814"">HTML is a ""Chomsky Type 2 grammar (context free grammar)""</a>, while
regular expressions are a ""Chomsky Type 3 grammar (regular grammar)"".</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Somestimes Regexes Are OK for HTML Parsing?</h2>

<p>However, people have also mentioned that in some cases, <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/1733489/456814"">it's okay to parse a
limited set of known HTML</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[I]t's sometimes appropriate to parse a limited, known set of HTML.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""http://blog.codinghorror.com/parsing-html-the-cthulhu-way/"" rel=""nofollow"">Jeff Atwood argues</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think that's just as
  wrongheaded as demanding <strong>every trivial HTML processing task be handled by a
  full-blown parsing engine</strong>. It's more important to understand the tools, and
  their strengths and weaknesses, than it is to knuckle under to knee-jerk
  dogmatism.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>I Don't Get It :(</h2>

<p>I've never understood in which circumstances it's ""appropriate"" to parse HTML
using a regex, as the two quotes above suggest. I guess it's because I don't
really understand the situations where regexes don't really work:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>So apparently regexes don't work when the HTML isn't even valid, is that
right?</p></li>
<li><p>What if you can expect your input HTML to always be valid? Is it ok to parse
it with regexes then?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Yes, I've seen <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/q/701166/456814"">this Stack Overflow question with examples already</a>.
No, the answers don't really help...<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/702222/456814"">this one, in particular, lacks
explanation</a>.</p>

<p>I'm bringing this question up now because I've been reading some of the source
code for <a href=""http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.1.1/libdoc/erb/rdoc/ERB.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Ruby ERB</a> and <a href=""http://jquery.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">jQuery</a>, and they use regexes to parse
HTML strings! <strong>So why do they use regexes instead of an HTML parser? Why do
regexes not lead to some kind incorrect behavior in these cases?</strong></p>

<h2>Ruby ERB Source Code</h2>

<p>So here's <a href=""https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/v2_1_1/lib/erb.rb#L421-L428"" rel=""nofollow"">the source code from ERB that's using regex to parse templates</a>:</p>

<pre class=""lang-ruby prettyprint-override""><code>def scan_line(line)
  line.scan(/(.*?)(&lt;%%|%%&gt;|&lt;%=|&lt;%#|&lt;%|%&gt;|\n|\z)/m) do |tokens|
    tokens.each do |token|
      next if token.empty?
      yield(token)
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>I've tested this out using the code below, and sure enough, <code>scan_line</code>
correctly tokenizes the template, parsing out HTML and ERB tags:</p>

<pre class=""lang-ruby prettyprint-override""><code>t = &lt;&lt;TEMPLATE
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;% cupcakes.each do |c| %&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oh boy, another cupcake!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Flavor: &lt;%= c.flavor %&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Price: &lt;%= c.price %&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;% end %&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
TEMPLATE

t.split(""\n"").each do |line|
  scan_line(line) { |token| puts token }
end
</code></pre>

<p>This produces the following output:</p>

<pre class=""lang-none prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;div&gt;

&lt;%
 cupcakes.each do |c|
%&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oh boy, another cupcake!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Flavor:
&lt;%=
 c.flavor
%&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Price:
&lt;%=
 c.price
%&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;%
 end
%&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2>jQuery Source Code</h2>

<p>Here's <a href=""https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/2.1.0/src/core/var/rsingleTag.js"" rel=""nofollow"">the regex in jQuery's source code</a>:</p>

<pre class=""lang-javascript prettyprint-override""><code>define(function() {
  // Match a standalone tag
  return (/^&lt;(\w+)\s*\/?&gt;(?:&lt;\/\1&gt;|)$/);
});
</code></pre>

<p>I've tested this out in my browser console, and it seems that it will only match
plain HTML tags, i.e. tags without attributes and text content. For example:</p>

<pre class=""lang-javascript prettyprint-override""><code>/^&lt;(\w+)\s*\/?&gt;(?:&lt;\/\1&gt;|)$/.exec('&lt;p&gt;Hello!&lt;/p&gt;');
// null

/^&lt;(\w+)\s*\/?&gt;(?:&lt;\/\1&gt;|)$/.exec('&lt;img src=""foo.jpg""/&gt;');
// null

/^&lt;(\w+)\s*\/?&gt;(?:&lt;\/\1&gt;|)$/.exec('&lt;img/&gt;');
// [""&lt;img/&gt;"", ""img""]

/^&lt;(\w+)\s*\/?&gt;(?:&lt;\/\1&gt;|)$/.exec('&lt;img&gt;');
// [""&lt;img/&gt;"", ""img""]

/^&lt;(\w+)\s*\/?&gt;(?:&lt;\/\1&gt;|)$/.exec('&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;')
// [""&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;"", ""div""]
</code></pre>

<h2>TL;DR Summary</h2>

<p>The Ruby ERB and jQuery source code above use regexes to parse HTML strings! <strong>So why do they use regexes instead of an HTML parser? Why do
regexes not lead to some kind incorrect behavior in these cases?</strong></p>

<p>If you can expect your input HTML to always be valid, is it then ok to parse it
with regexes?</p>
","2988","","<p>ERb has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with HTML. The ERb library parses ERb, not HTML. ERb has been specifically designed to be trivial to parse with Ruby's <code>Regexp</code>s.</p>

","2988","","<p><code>&amp;&amp;</code> is the logical AND operator. It will be truthy, IFF both operands are truthy. And it is lazy (aka short-circuiting), which means it will stop evaluating as soon as the result has been fully determined. (So, since both operands need to be truthy, if the first operand is falsy, you already know that the result is going to be falsy, without even evaluating the second operand.) It will also not just return <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>, but rather return the operand which determines the outcome. IOW: if <code>a</code> is falsy, it'll return <code>a</code>, otherwise it'll return <code>b</code>:</p>

<pre><code>nil &amp;&amp; (loop {})
# =&gt; nil
# Note: the infinite loop is *not* evaluated
# Note: the return value is nil, not false

true &amp;&amp; nil
# =&gt; nil

true &amp;&amp; 'Hello'
# =&gt; 'Hello'
</code></pre>

<p><code>&amp;</code> simply calls the method <code>&amp;</code>. It will do whatever the object wants it to do:</p>

<pre><code>def (weirdo = Object.new).&amp;(other)
  puts 'Whoah, weird!'
  'Hello, ' + other
end

weirdo &amp; 'World'
# Whoah, weird!
# =&gt; 'Hello, World'

<p>In general, <code>&amp;</code> and its brother <code>|</code> are expected to perform conjunction and disjunction.

<p>Are you asking why the type of <code>sum</code> isn't declared or why the return type of the function literal isn't declared? The return type of the function literal isn't declared because there is no way in the syntax to do so. You simply <em>cannot</em> declare the return type of a function literal, it is always inferred. The type of <code>sum</code> isn't declared because it is not necessary: it can be inferred to be the same as the type of the function literal, i.e. <code>Function2[Int, Int, Int]</code>.</p>

<p>Think <code>val foo = ""Hello""</code>.</p>

<p>No. This is the exact same thing as 2., except that here the type of <code>sum</code> is explicitly declared (as <code>(Int, Int) =&gt; Int</code> which is syntactic sugar for <code>Function[Int, Int, Int]</code>) instead of inferred. Since the type of <code>sum</code> is known, you can leave off the types of the function parameters, because they can be inferred from the context.</p>

"<p>In this <a href=""http://functionaltalks.org/2014/03/31/runar-oli-bjarnason-functional-programming-is-terrible/"" rel=""nofollow"">talk</a>, in the first 8 minutes, Runar explains that Scala has problems with tail call elimination, this makes me wonder whether F# has similar problems ? If not, why not ?</p>
","2988","","<p>The problem with Proper Tail Calls in Scala is one of engineering trade-offs. It would be easily possible to add PTCs to Scala: just add a sentence to the SLS. Voilà: PTCs in Scala. From a Language Design perspective, we are done.</p>

<p>Now the poor compiler writers need to <em>implement</em> that spec. Well, compiling <em>into</em> a language with PTCs is easy … but unfortunately, the JVM byte code isn't such a language. Okay, so what about <code>GOTO</code>? Nope. Continuations? Nope. Exceptions (which are known to be equivalent to Continuations)? Ah, now we are getting somewhere! So, we <em>could</em> use exceptions to implement PTCs. Or, alternatively, we could just not use the JVM call stack at all and implement our own stack.</p>

<p>After all, there are multiple Scheme implementations on the JVM, all of them support PTCs just fine. It's a myth that you cannot have PTCs on the JVM, just because the JVM doesn't support them. After all, x86 doesn't have them either, but nonetheless, there are languages running on x86 that have them.</p>

<p>So, if implementing PTCs on the JVM is possible, then why doesn't Scala have them? Like I said above, you could use exceptions or your own stack to implement them. But using exceptions for control flow or implementing your own stack means that everything which expects the JVM call stack to look a certain way would no longer work.</p>

<p>In particular, you would lose pretty much all interoperability with the Java tooling ecosystem (debuggers, visualizers, static analyzers). You would also have to build bridges to interoperate with Java libraries, which would be slow, so you lose interop with the Java library ecosystem as well.</p>

<p>But that is a major design goal of Scala! And that's why Scala doesn't have PTCs.</p>

<p>I call this ""Hickey's Theorem"", after Rich Hickey, the designer of Clojure who once said in a talk ""Tail Calls, Interop, Performance – Pick Two.""</p>

<p>You would also present the JIT compiler with some very unusual byte code patterns that it may not know how to optimize well.</p>

<p>If you were to port F# to the JVM, you would basically have to make exactly that choice: do you give up Tail Calls (you can't, because they are required by the Language Spec), do you give up Interop or do you give up Performance? On .NET, you can have all three, because Tail Calls in F# can simply be compiled into Tail Calls in MSIL. (Although the actual translation is more complex than that, and the implementation of Tail Calls in MSIL is buggy in some corner cases.)</p>

<p>This poses the question: why not add Tail Calls to the JVM? Well, this is very hard, due to a design flaw in the JVM byte code. The designers wanted the JVM byte code to have certain safety properties. But instead of designing the JVM byte code language in such a way that you cannot write an unsafe program in the first place (like, say, in Java, for example, where you cannot write a program that violates pointer safety, because the language just doesn't give you access to pointers in the first place), JVM byte code in itself is unsafe and needs a separate byte code verifier to make it safe.</p>

<p>That byte code verifier is based on stack inspection, and Tail Calls change the stack. So, the two are <em>very</em> hard to reconcile, but the JVM simply doesn't work without the byte code verifier. It took a long time and some very smart people to finally figure out how to implement Tail Calls on the JVM without losing the byte code verifier, so we have now moved from the stage where it was an open research problem to the stage where it is ""just"" an open engineering problem.</p>

<li><p>Anything else that isnt correct with this code?</p></li>
</ol>
","2988","","<p>Here are my thoughts:</p>

<p><strong>Naming</strong>: Predicate methods in Ruby are named <code>predicate?</code> and not <code>is_predicate</code>, so the name of your method should be <code>divisible?</code> … except that it <em>isn't</em> actually a predicate. It doesn't test whether a number is divisible by another number, rather it finds the first number in an <code>Enumerable</code> which is divisible by another number. That sentence almost sounds like a descriptive method name, doesn't it?</p>

<pre><code>def find_first_divisible(nums, n)
  nums.each do |m|
    if n % m == 0
      return n
    end
  end
  0
end
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Naming cont'd</strong>: We don't charge you for your characters. You can use more of them if you want ;-) <code>nums</code> is probably okay, <code>n</code> is on the fence, but what the heck is <code>m</code>? In fact, you have a bug there, which is caused precisely by you confusing <code>n</code> and <code>m</code>.</p>

<pre><code>def find_first_divisible(numbers, divisor)
  numbers.each do |n|
    if n % divisor == 0
      return n
    end
  end
  0
end
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Guard clauses</strong>: For cases like this, where you want to use <code>return</code> (or <code>next</code>) to break out early, I prefer to use a guard clause style of the form ""do this if that"":</p>

<pre><code>def find_first_divisible(numbers, divisor)
  numbers.each do |n|
    return n if n % divisor == 0
  end
  0
end
</code></pre>

<p><strong>One line blocks</strong>: In this case, the contents of the block are short enough to fit on one line, so I would do that. Note that there are two competing styles for block formatting: one says to always use <code>do</code>/<code>end</code> for multiline blocks and always use <code>{</code>/<code>}</code> for single line blocks. The other says to always use <code>do</code>/<code>end</code> for blocks which are used primarily for their side-effects (""imperative blocks"") and <code>{</code>/<code>}</code> for blocks which are used primarily for their return value (""functional blocks""). I prefer the latter style.</p>

<pre><code>def find_first_divisible(numbers, divisor)
  numbers.each do |n| return n if n % divisor == 0 end
  0
end
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Descriptive methods</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>def find_first_divisible(numbers, divisor)
  numbers.each do |n| return n if (n % divisor).zero? end
  0
end
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Know the core and standard libraries</strong>: This is very important, you don't want to reinvent the wheel!</p>

<pre><code>def find_first_divisible(numbers, divisor)
  numbers.find {|n| (n % divisor).zero? } || 0
end
</code></pre>

<p>Note how I changed the block style: now we are interested in the return value, there are no side-effects.</p>

<p><strong>Extract methods with meaningful names</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>class Integer
  def divisible_by?(n) (self % n).zero? end
end

def find_first_divisible(numbers, divisor)
  numbers.find {|n| n.divisible_by?(divisor) } || 0
end
</code></pre>

<p>Now, the method reads <em>exactly</em> like your description in the question: ""within <code>numbers</code>, find the first <code>n</code> which is <code>divisible_by</code> the <code>divisor</code>, and if there is none, the result is <code>0</code>"".</p>

<p><strong>Respect conventions</strong>: Last but not least, you should respect the conventions of the community. Methods that search for something should return <code>nil</code> to indicate the absence of a result:</p>

<pre><code>def find_first_divisible(numbers, divisor)
  numbers.find {|n| n.divisible_by?(divisor) }

","2988","","<p>Blocks are a lightweight way of passing a single anonymous procedure to a method. So, <em>by definition</em>, there cannot be two blocks passed to a method. It's not just semantically impossible, it isn't even possible <em>syntactically</em>.</p>

<p>Ruby <em>does</em> support first-class procedures in the form of <code>Proc</code>s, however, and since those are just objects like any other object, you can pass as many of them as you want:</p>

<pre><code>def by_two(n, a, proc1, proc2)
  proc1.(n)
  proc2.(a)
end

proc1 = proc {|x| p x * 2}
proc2 = proc {|x| x + 100}

<p>Since the introduction of lambda literals in Ruby 1.9, <code>Proc</code>s are almost as syntactically lightweight as blocks, so there is not a big difference anymore:</p>

Some environments also use other methods, e.g. <code>pry</code> (or some plugin) uses <code>pretty_inspect</code> for ""pretty"" human-readable debugging output. You need to implement those methods.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>I'm used to <code>hi</code> not being in the scope of the <code>puts</code>, so it would error. How does scope in Ruby work. I can't seem to find a clear tutorial explaining it.</p>

","2988","","<p>In Ruby, there are 5 scopes:</p>

<li>class scope</li>
<li>method scope</li>
<li>block scope</li>
</ul>

<p>Block scopes nest, the other ones don't. Blocks can close over their lexical environment, the other ones can't. (IOW: not only do they nest inside their lexically surrounding environment, i.e. can access variables from their lexically surrounding environment, they can even continue to do so after that surrounding environment ceases to exist.)</p>

<p>Unlike some other languages, Ruby doesn't have a top-level or global scope for local variables. The ""biggest"" scope is script scope, but that isn't global, it is confined to a single script. (Usually, a script is the same as a file, but there are Ruby implementations that don't use files, so a term like ""file scope"" would be misleading.)</p>

<p>Local variables are defined from the point on where their definition is <em>parsed</em>, and initialized from the point on that their definition is <em>executed</em>. In between, when they are defined but not initialized, they evaluate to <code>nil</code>.</p>

<pre><code>if false
  hi = 'hello'
end

hi

"<p><code>This is kind of an odd question, but I don't .......</code></p>

<p>I overcomplicated the original question. If you want to see the original question, look through the previous edits. Here's my revised question by combining my two previous questions, as simple as I can explain it:</p>

<p>I have an object. The object can have (x) amount of fields and all of the fields and values can be different. Example: </p>

<p><code>#&lt;User name=""John"", height=75&gt;</code> or <code>#&lt;Comment title=""First!""&gt;</code></p>

<p>I'm using a gem/db requires a specific format for queries. This is the format that the query MUST have: <code>CREATE (u:User{attribute: ""Some att."", another_att: 32})</code> and so on and so forth. Notice the JavaScript-like hash it uses for its values. </p>

<p>I'm trying to interpolate an object's attributes into the query. But I don't know how to map the correct fields and values into the query. Here's an example of what I start with and what I want to end with:</p>

<p><code>object = #&lt;User name=""John"", height=75&gt;</code> => </p>

<p><code>""CREATE (u:User{name: ""John"", height: 75})""</code></p>

<p>What's the simplest way to achieve this? Thanks to everyone who's helped so far.</p>

<p>Note that it is possible to convert the attributes to a Ruby hash: <code>{:name =&gt; ""John"", :height =&gt; 75}</code>, (as explained in the original question) but it was too confusing to change that hash to the syntax in the query, so I've backtracked and simplified my question.</p>
","2988","","<p>This doesn't make sense. There has to be something else going on here.</p>

<p>A hash is a hash is a hash, it doesn't matter what syntax you used to create it, it's still the <em>exact</em> same hash. Those four are 100% equivalent (and if they aren't, that's a bug in your Ruby implementation):</p>

<pre><code>hash = { name: 'John' }

hash = { :name =&gt; 'John' }

hash = {}
hash[:name] = 'John'

hash = Hash.new
hash[%Q|name|.to_sym] = %w@John@.first
</code></pre>

<p>There is absolutely no difference between them. There is no such thing as a ""Hashrocket <code>Hash</code>"" or ""JSON-style <code>Hash</code>"". There <em>is</em> a difference between the literals used to construct those hashes, but that difference only exists at parse time. At runtime, they are just as identical as <code>16</code>, <code>0x10</code> and <code>020</code> are.</p>

<p>Given that you program isn't even syntactically legal, it's impossible to tell what its semantics would be if it were syntactically legal, let alone why those semantics were wrong. However, here's an idiomatic Ruby solution (you will almost never use nor see <code>while</code> in any Ruby code, and you will certainly never see <code>for</code>):</p>

<pre><code>puts x.take_while {|n| n &lt; 15 }
puts 'too big'

<p>I prefer writing in point-free style, however in this case the only way to do that is to make use of the symmetry of the condition and invert the order of operands, which will lead to awkward logic:</p>

<pre><code>x.take_while(&amp;15.method(:&gt;))
</code></pre>

<p>Ao, in this case I would rather avoid point-free style, because it no longer matches the original specification literally. Instead of ""take all numbers less than 15"", we now have ""take all numbers such that 15 is greater than those numbers"", which reads awkward.</p>

<p>If I create a hierarchy of sealed classes in my project it's all fine, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>sealed abstract class Base {}

<p>If <em>sealing</em> works in the abouve situations, how is it implmented?</p>
","2988","","<p>Java doesn't have a concept of <code>sealed</code> templates, therefore it is simply impossible for the Java compiler to enforce <code>sealed</code> constraints, because it doesn't even know they exist.</p>

<p>This is not specific to <code>sealed</code> and not even specific to Scala/Java. This kind of thing <em>only</em> works if both languages know about each other (i.e. the Scala compiler needs to know about every programming language that could conceivably be used to interoperate with it, <em>including</em> ones that don't even exist yet, and vice-versa, every compiler and interpreter for a language that could conceivably be used to interoperate with Scala needs to know about Scala, even compilers that were written before Scala existed) and they can agree on a a way to communicate those semantics between each other.</p>

<p>Of course, having all languages know about all other languages is O(n²) and doesn't scale, and obviously having languages know about languages that don't exist yet is just impossible. So, what we do instead is to define a common language that all languages know about. On Unix, that's C structs + C function calls, on the CLI, that's CIL byte code and on the Java platform, that's JVM byte code.</p>

<p>This means that Scala and Java can communicate with each other via a detour through JVM byte code, but obviously they can only communicate semantics which can be expressed in JVM byte code. And <code>sealed</code> is not one of those.</p>

<p><strong>Scala uses an annotation to encode <code>sealed</code> in the byte code, but Java doesn't understand that annotation, and even if it did, it doesn't actually cleanly map to any concept in Java anyway!

        this._someProp = value;
    }

","2988","","<p>There are three ways in general use. One way is to use the default value to set another variable indicating whether or not the default value was evaluated:</p>

  'no arguments passed' if no_argument_passed
end

f      # =&gt; 'no arguments passed'

  undefined = BasicObject.new
  define_method(:f) do |p1 = undefined|
    'no arguments passed' if undefined.equal?(p1)
  end
}.()

f      # =&gt; 'no arguments passed'
f(nil) # =&gt; nil
</code></pre>

<p>Of these two, the first one is more idiomatic. The second one (actually, a variation of it) is used inside Rubinius, but I have never encountered it anywhere else.</p>

<p>A third solution would be to take a variable number of arguments using a splat:</p>

<pre><code>def f(*ps)
  num_args = ps.size
  raise ArgumentError, ""wrong number of arguments (#{num_args} for 0..1)"" if num_args &gt; 1
  'no arguments passed' if num_args.zero?
end

f(nil) # =&gt; nil

<p>Note that this requires you to re-implement Ruby's arity checking by hand. (And we still haven't gotten it right, because this raises the exception <em>inside</em> the method, whereas Ruby would raise it at the <em>call site</em>.) It also requires you to manually document your method signature because automated documentation generators such as RDoc or YARD will infer an arbitrary number of parameters instead of a single optional one.</p>

"<p>Disclaimer: I'm much more experienced in Java than in Scala (which I'm learning). </p>

<p>In Java, I have read several times that switch could be harmful to object orientation, especially when used against types (this kind of problems also led to this: <a href=""http://www.antiifcampaign.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.antiifcampaign.com/</a>).</p>

<p>In Scala, one of the introduction video lessons of Martin Odersky shows how pattern matching is a better alternative to multiple ""low-level"" <code>isInstanceOf</code> checks. </p>

<p>Although, pattern matching catches more flexible patterns than a simple Java switch, I still see the first as a generalization of the latter. </p>

<p>Don't pattern matching and ""switch on types"" roughly share the same fundamental approach?
Isn't pattern matching just some syntactic sugar hiding lots of <code>isInstanceOf</code>/<code>asInstanceOf</code>?</p>

<p>If not, how would pattern matching be more flexible (as in: resilient to change) than writing those low level checks ourselves (apart from the error-prone nature of this tedious task)?</p>
","2988","","<p>In Scala, pattern matching is done via extractors. Extractors are themselves objects and only have access to the public API of the object that is being pattern matched against.</p>

<p>Thus, pattern matching does not break object encapsulation.</p>

<p>Theoretically, all conditionals (including pattern matching) can be replaced by polymorphism. See Smalltalk as an example of a language which has no conditionals, no loops, no switches, no control structures of any kind except polymorphic message dispatch. And see Newspeak as an example of a Smalltalk-inspired language which has powerful pattern matching inspired by Scala and F# implemented as a library completely on top of polymorphic message dispatch.</p>

<p>When done this way, pattern matching is as object-oriented as can be.</p>

<li>Methods can have optional parameters with default arguments, functions can't.</li>
<li>Methods can have varargs, functions can't.</li>
<li>Methods can have implicit arguments, functions can't.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are 4 restrictions that functions have compared to methods. Now, if they are so restricted, why do we use them? Well, there is one major advantage functions have:</p>

<ul>
<li>Functions are objects, methods aren't (they belong to objects.)</li>
</ul>

<p>This means: functions can be assigned to <code>val</code>s/<code>var</code>s, they can be passed as arguments to functions, methods and constructors, they can be returned from functions and methods. Methods cannot do any of that: Scala is an object-oriented language, all entities that can be manipulated by the program are objects … and methods aren't.</p>

<p>So, why does </p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>rdd.groupBy(f)
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>work?</p>

<p>Well, you can convert a method into a partially applied function (here ""partially applied"" means ""partially applied to <code>this</code>"", not to a subset of the arguments) via &eta;-expansion:</p>

<pre><code>val fn = f _
// =&gt; fn: Int =&gt; Int = &lt;function1&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Here, as is so often the case in Scala, the underscore is used as a placeholder (in this case for the yet to be supplied arguments). We have fixed the <code>this</code> of the method and left the arguments open, and created a function corresponding to that method.</p>

<p>In <em>some</em> cases, Scala will know that you want to perform &eta;-expansion even <em>without</em> explicitly providing the underscore. That's why </p>

<pre><code>rdd.groupBy(f)
</code></pre>

<p>works. This is called <em>implicit &eta;-expansion</em> (§6.26.2 case 3 of the Scala Language Specification) and, because of ambiguities, works only in a limited amount of cases.</p>

<p>However, after having explained all this, I must admit, that I don't see why your second example doesn't work. According to my reading of the spec, it should.</p>

<p>IOW: the <em>fundamental</em> problem you seem to be having is that you confuse functions and methods, but in <em>this particular case</em>, it should actually work (at least according to my interpretation of the spec, although clearly not according to the compiler writers' interpretation).</p>

"<p>In Ruby 2.1.2p95 I wanted to check if a class method was being called using the same class it was defined in or using a child class. That's to say, which of these is happening:</p>

<pre><code>Parent.my_method
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>Child.my_method
</code></pre>

<p>I tried this:</p>

<pre><code>def self.my_method
  if self == self.method(__method__).owner
    puts ""called in Parent""
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>But while <code>self</code> returns the name of the class, e.g. <code>'Parent'</code>,  <code>Method#owner</code> returns something that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>#&lt;Class:Parent&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So, um, what's that? </p>

<p>And is there a slick way of testing whether something's being called from the parent or the child?</p>

<hr>

<p>Update for clarity: I'm only defining a class method in the parent. I'm not overriding anything. I'm merely calling the parent class method either directly (Parent.my_method) or via a child (Child.my_method) and I want to be able to tell the difference.</p>
","2988","","<p>You should <em>never</em> ever ever have to check what <code>self</code> is. That's just <em>wrong</em>. <code>self</code> knows about itself, it shouldn't have to check. Do you get up in the morning and look in the mirror to check who you are?</p>

<p>That's what polymorphism is for:</p>

<pre><code>class Parent; end
class Child &lt; Parent; end

def Parent.my_method; 'Called in Parent' end
def Child.my_method;  'Called in Child'  end

"<p>I come from a C# background, and that's probably the reason for my hesitation, but imagine we have the following scenario. We have a class that takes in some raw data, and then pushes it up to some external API. In the process of doing so, we need to process the data according to some business rules. The catch is, these business rules aren't always the same. In C#, I would use an interface for the ""data processing"" business rules, and then use different implementations at different times:</p>

<pre><code>public interface IDataProcessor
{
    object Process(object data);
}

public class SomeBuilder
{
    private object _data;
    private IDataProcessor _dataProcessor;
    public SomeBuilder(object data, IDataProcessor dataProcessor)
    {
        _data = data;
        _dataProcessor = dataProcessor;
    }

    public void Build()
    {
        var processedData = _dataProcessor.Process(_data);
        //do the fun building stuff with processedData
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>In the above example, I would have different implementations of my <code>IDataProcessor</code> that process the data differently.</p>

<p>Now, in the Ruby world, my first inkling was to do something similar:</p>

<pre><code>class SomeBuilder
    def initialize(some_data, data_processor)
        @some_date = some_date
        @data_processor = data_processor
    end

    def build
        processed_data = @data_processor.process(@some_data)
        #do build logic
    end
end
</code></pre>

<p>My issue is twofold: First, this somehow doesn't ""feel"" quite right in the Ruby ecosystem. e.g. is this the Ruby way? Second of all, if I were to go down this path, what would the data_processor look like? It feels like it should be a module, since it's just some behavior, but if it <strong>is</strong> just a module, how do I interchangeably use different modules in my SomeBuilder class?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>
","2988","","<p>Your interface has only a single method. An object with only a single method is isomorphic to a function/procedure. (And an object with some fields and a single method is isomorphic to a closure). Therefore, you would actually use a first-class procedure.</p>

<pre><code>class SomeBuilder
  def initialize(some_data, &amp;data_processor)
    @some_data, @data_processor = some_data, data_processor
  end

  def build
    processed_data = @data_processor.(@some_data)
    #do build logic
  end
end

# e.g. a stringifier-builder:
builder = SomeBuilder.new(42) do |data| data.to_s end
# which in this case is equivalent to:
builder = SomeBuilder.new(42, &amp;:to_s)
</code></pre>

<p>Actually, you would probably do the same thing in C# as well. (Plus, you probably should make it generic.)</p>

<pre><code>public class SomeBuilder&lt;I, O&gt;
{
    private I _data;
    private Func&lt;I, O&gt; _dataProcessor;
    public SomeBuilder(I data, Func&lt;I, O&gt; dataProcessor)
    {
        _data = data;
        _dataProcessor = dataProcessor;
    }

    public void Build()
    {
        var processedData = _dataProcessor(_data);
        //do the fun building stuff with processedData
    }
}

// untested

// e.g. a stringifier-builder
var builder = new SomeBuilder(42, data =&gt; data.ToString());

<p>We are calling a class method so it properly sees the instance variable of the class object.</p>

<p>We are calling an object method through the class which is incorrect so throwing <code>NoMethodError</code>.</p>

","2988","","<blockquote>

<p>No, it doesn't. Classes are objects just like any other object. They can have instance variables just like any other object. They can have instance methods just like any other object. In fact, unlike Java, which has three different kinds of ""methods"" (instance methods, static methods and constructors), in Ruby, there is exactly one kind of method: instance methods.</p>

<p>The beauty of having classes being objects is precisely that <code>@variable</code> always means <em>exactly the same thing</em>.</p>

<p>There is no such thing as a class instance variable: it's just a normal instance variable like any other. The object happens to be an instance of <code>Class</code>, but that doesn't change the nature of the instance variable. An instance variable of an object of class <code>String</code> is not a string instance variable, it's just an instance variable. Likewise, an instance variable of an object of class <code>Class</code> is just an instance variable.</p>

<p>There is no such thing as a class method: it's just a normal singleton method of an object which happens to be an instance of <code>Class</code>. (Acually, there's no such thing as a singleton method either: it's just a normal instance method of the object's singleton class.)</p>

<p>Note: Rubyists may use the term ""class method"" in casual conversation. But that doesn't mean that class methods actually exist, it only means that ""instance method of the class object's singleton class"" is a mouthful. The important thing is: because classes are objects, they work <em>exactly</em> like all other objects. They can have instance methods (defined in class <code>Class</code> or inherited from <code>Module</code>, <code>Object</code>, <code>Kernel</code> or <code>BasicObject</code>), they can have ""singleton methods"" (which really are instance methods of their respective singleton classes), they can have instance variables.</p>

<p>They can <em>also</em> have class variables (<code>@@variables</code>) … those are weird. Ignore them :-)</p>

"<p>So, pattern matching in functional languages is pretty awesome. I wondering why most imperative languages haven't implemented this feature? To my understanding, Scala is the only ""mainstream"" imperative language that has pattern matching. The case/switch structure is just so much less powerful.</p>

<p>In particular, I am interested in whether the lack of pattern matching is because of technical reasons or historical reasons?</p>
","2988","","<p>Until recently (more precisely: until Scala), it was believed that pattern matching was incompatible with representation ignorance (i.e. <em>the</em> defining characteristic of OO). Since OO is a major paradigm in mainstream languages, having a seemingly irreconcilable feature in a mainstream language seemingly didn't make sense.</p>

<p>In Scala, pattern matching is reconciled with OO, simply by having the match operations be method calls on an object. (Rather simple in hindsight, no?) In particular, matches are performed by calling methods on <em>extractor objects</em>, which, just like any other object, only have access to the public API of the object being examined, thus not breaking encapsulation.</p>

<p>A pattern matching library inspired by Scala, in which patterns are first-class objects themselves (inspired by F#'s Active Patterns) was added to Newspeak, a <em>very</em> dynamic language that takes OO <em>very</em> seriously. (Newspeak doesn't even have variables, just methods.)</p>

<p>Note that regular expressions are an example of a limited form of pattern matching. Polymorphic method dispatch can also be seen as an example of a limited form of pattern matching (without the extraction features). In fact, method dispatch is powerful enough to <em>implement</em> full pattern matching as evidenced by Scala and especially Newspeak (in the latter, pattern matching is even implemented as a library, completely separate from the language).</p>

","2988","","<p>Messages are fundamental, not just in Ruby, but in OO in general.</p>

<p>The term ""Object-Orientation"" was invented by Alan Kay, and he defines it <a href=""http://www.purl.org/stefan_ram/pub/doc_kay_oop_en"">this way</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>OOP to me means only messaging, local retention and protection and hiding of state-process, and extreme late-binding of all things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In more modern terms:</p>

<ul>
<li>messaging</li>
<li>encapsulation</li>
<li>late-binding</li>
</ul>

<p>Implementation-wise, messaging is a late-bound procedure call, and if procedure calls are late-bound, then you cannot know at design time <em>what</em> you are going to call, so you cannot make any assumptions about the concrete representation of state. So, really it is about messaging, late-binding is an implementation of messaging and encapsulation is a consequence of it.</p>

<p>He later on clarified that ""<a href=""http://lists.squeakfoundation.org/pipermail/squeak-dev/1998-October/017019.html"">The big idea is 'messaging'</a>"", and regrets having called it ""object-oriented"" instead of ""message-oriented"", because the term ""object-oriented"" puts the focus on the unimportant thing (objects) and distracts from what is really important (messaging):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Just a gentle reminder that I took some pains at the last OOPSLA to try to remind everyone that Smalltalk is not only NOT its syntax or the class library, it is not even about classes. I'm sorry that I long ago coined the term ""objects"" for this topic because it gets many people to focus on the lesser idea.</p>
  
  <p>The big idea is ""messaging"" -- that is what the kernal of Smalltalk/Squeak is all about (and it's something that was never quite completed in our Xerox PARC phase). The Japanese have a small word -- ma -- for ""that which is in between"" -- perhaps the nearest English equivalent is ""interstitial"". The key in making great and growable systems is much more to design how its modules communicate rather than what their internal properties and behaviors should be. Think of the internet -- to live, it (a) has to allow many different kinds of ideas and realizations that are beyond any single standard and (b) to allow varying degrees of safe interoperability between these ideas.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Of course, today, most people don't even focus on objects but on classes, which is even more wrong.)</p>

<p>Messaging is <em>fundamental</em> to OO, both as metaphor and as a mechanism.</p>

<p>If you send someone a message, you don't know what they do with it. The <em>only</em> thing you can observe, is their response. You don't know whether they processed the message themselves (i.e. if the object has a method), if they forwarded the message to someone else (delegation / proxying), if they even understood it. That's what encapsulation is all about, that's what OO is all about. You cannot even distinguish a proxy from the real thing, as long as it responds how you expect it to.</p>

<p>A more ""modern"" term for ""messaging"" is ""dynamic method dispatch"" or ""virtual method call"", but that loses the metaphor and focuses on the mechanism.</p>

<p>Similar points are also made in <a href=""http://CS.UTexas.Edu/~wcook/Drafts/2009/essay.pdf""><em>On Understanding Data Abstraction, Revisited</em></a> by <a href=""http://WCook.BlogSpot.Com/"">William R. Cook</a> and also his <a href=""http://WCook.BlogSpot.Com/2012/07/proposal-for-simplified-modern.html""><em>Proposal for Simplified, Modern Definitions of ""Object"" and ""Object Oriented""</em></a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dynamic dispatch of operations is the essential characteristic of objects. It means that the operation to be invoked is a dynamic property of the object itself. Operations cannot be identified statically, and there is no way in general to exactly what operation will executed in response to a given request, except by running it. This is exactly the same as with first-class functions, which are always dynamically dispatched.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In Smalltalk-72, there weren't even any objects! There were <em>only</em> message streams that got parsed, rewritten and rerouted. First came methods (standard ways to parse and reroute the message streams), later came objects (groupings of methods that share some private state). Inheritance came much later, and classes were only introduced as a way to support inheritance. Had Kay's research group already known about prototypes, they probably would have never introduced classes in the first place.</p>

","2988","","<p><code>return</code> returns from a method. It can only be used inside a method. There is no method in your code, therefore you get an error … and even if there <em>were</em> a method, the code wouldn't do what you want, because <code>return</code> returns from the method, not the block.</p>

<p>To return a value from a block, use <code>next</code>:</p>

(Actually, <em>everything</em> is an expression in Ruby, there are <em>no</em> statements.) This means that everything, including a conditional expression, returns a value. For <code>if</code>/<code>then</code>/<code>else</code> the value being returned is the one from the branch that was taken.</p>

<p>So, instead of returning from each of the branches separately, we can just return the vlue of the whole <code>if</code> expression:</p>

  next if b &lt; a 
    -1
  elsif b &gt; a
    1
  else
    0

    -1
  elsif b &gt; a
    1

<p>You cannot parse this with a JSON parser because it's not JSON.</p>

"<p>I am getting <code>NameError: undefined local variable or method</code> with ruby 2.1.2</p>

<p>As observed in <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15102804/ruby-variable-scope-and-order-of-parsing-vs-operations-assignment-in-an-if"">this question</a>, expressions like:</p>

<pre><code>bar if bar = true
</code></pre>

<p>raises an undefined local variable error (provided that <code>bar</code> is not defined prior) because <code>bar</code> is read by the parser before it is assigned. And I believe that there used to be no difference with that with this expression:</p>

<pre><code>bar if bar = false
</code></pre>

<p>The difference between the two is whether the main body is evaluated or not, but that should not matter if encountering an undefined local variable immediately raises an error before evaluating the condition.</p>

<p>But when I run the second code on Ruby 2.1.2, it does not raise an error. Has it been like that from before? If so, then what was the parsing discussion all about? If not, has Ruby specification changed? Is there any reference to that?  What did it do in 1.8.7, 1.9.3, etc. ?</p>
","2988","","<p>There is no difference with regards to whether <code>bar</code> is defined or not. In both cases, <code>bar</code> is undefined in the body. However, in the latter case, the body is never evaluated, therefore it doesn't matter. You never resolve the name <code>bar</code>, therefore you never get an error during name resolution.</p>

<p>Local variables are <em>defined</em> when an assignment is <em>parsed</em>.
They are <em>initialized</em> when an assignment is <em>executed</em>.</p>

<p>It's perfectly fine for a variable to be unitialized. It will just evaluate to <code>nil</code> in that case:</p>

<pre><code>if false
  bar = 42
end

bar
# =&gt; nil
</code></pre>

<p>However, if the variable is <em>undefined</em>, then Ruby doesn't know whether a bare word is a local variable or a receiverless argumentless message send:</p>

<pre><code>foo
# NameError: undefined local variable or method `foo'
#                                     ^^^^^^^^^
# Ruby doesn't know whether it's a variable or a message send
</code></pre>

<p>Compare with:</p>

<pre><code>foo()
# NoMethodError: undefined method `foo'
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^

self.foo
# NoMethodError: undefined method `foo'
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
</code></pre>

<p>All together now:</p>

<pre><code>foo()
# NoMethodError: undefined method `foo'

self.foo
# NoMethodError: undefined method `foo'

foo
# NameError: undefined local variable or method `foo'

if false
  foo = 42
end

foo
# =&gt; nil

foo = :fortytwo

foo
# =&gt; :fortytwo
</code></pre>

<p>The trouble in this particular case is that the order in which the expressions are <em>parsed</em> (and thus the order in which variables are defined) <em>does not</em> match with the order in which the expressions are <em>executed</em>.</p>

<p>The assignment is executed <em>first</em>, which would make you assume that <code>bar</code> would be defined in the body. But it isn't, because the body was <em>parsed</em> first and thus an <strong>I don't know whether this is a method or a variable</strong> node was inserted into the syntax tree <em>before</em> the assignment was ever seen.</p>

<p>However, if that node is never interpreted, i.e. the condition is false, then nothing bad will happen.</p>

<p>Originally, matz didn't want to choose a name, rather he wanted the community to settle on one. Unfortunately, it didn't. When matz and David Flanagan wrote <a href=""http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596516178.do"" rel=""nofollow""><em>The Ruby Programming Language</em></a>, they had to choose, and they chose <em>eigenclass</em> (but <em>singleton method</em>). Eigenclass was also used in the first drafts for the ISO Ruby Language Specification (but mainly <a href=""https://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/199952#871048"" rel=""nofollow"">because it was very easy to run a search&amp;replace on that name once an ""official"" one had been found</a>).</p>

<p>However, in the <a href=""https://www.ipa.go.jp/osc/english/ruby/"" rel=""nofollow"">later drafts</a> and the <a href=""http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=59579"" rel=""nofollow"">final version of the ISO Ruby Language Specification</a>, <em>singleton class</em> is used. That name was also chosen, when the <a href=""http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.2/Object.html#method-i-singleton_class"" rel=""nofollow""><code>Object#singleton_class</code></a> accessor method was finally formally introduced in Ruby 1.9.2 and <a href=""http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.2/Module.html#method-i-singleton_class-3F"" rel=""nofollow""><code>Module#singleton_class?</code></a> was introduced in Ruby 2.1.</p>

<p><em>Metaclass</em> was the term used by <a href=""https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_the_lucky_stiff"" rel=""nofollow"">_why the lucky stiff</a> in <a href=""http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide/"" rel=""nofollow""><em>Why's (Poignant) Guide to Ruby</em></a> (and other writings and libraries), which was highly influential on a whole generation of non-Japanese-speaking Ruby developers, and for a long time the best introduction to Ruby metaprogramming (and the only English one).</p>

<p>Nowadays, the terms singleton class and eigenclass seem to predominantly used (with singleton class taking over, thanks to the method names in the core library), with the occasional mention of metaclass.</p>

<p>Personally, I never liked metaclass, because it actually already has a different meaning: the metaclass is the class of a class. In Ruby, classes have <em>two</em> classes that define their behavior: their singleton class and the <code>Class</code> class, either one of which could be considered their metaclass. (Although neither of those classes can do what metaclasses in other languages can do, e.g. change the rules the method lookup or inheritance.)</p>

<p>Virtual class is even more problematic, because not only does it have a different meaning in programming in general (a nested class that can be overridden in a subclass, as in e.g. Beta or Newspeak, and proposed but abandoned for Scala), it even already has a <em>third</em> different meaning <em>within the Ruby community</em>: virtual class is the name given inside the MRI and YARV source code to singleton classes and include classes.</p>

<p>Inner class also already has a meaning as synonym to nested class (a class which is a member of an outer class, just like a method).</p>

<p>Personally, I always liked eigenclass, in symmetry to already established technical terms such as eigenvalue, eigenvector, eigenspace, eigenfunction, eigenface, eigenwave, eigenplane, eigenstate, eigenproblem etc. However, I have now adopted the term singleton class, simply because it's easier to talk about the <code>singleton_class</code> method as returning the singleton class.</p>

There are a few implementations of <code>Array#to_proc</code> in the wild, but most of them interpret <code>&amp;[:one, :two]</code> as <code>_.one.two</code>, and not <code>[_.one, _.two]</code>. Mathematically speaking, an <code>Array</code> is isomorphic to a function from <code>Integer</code>s to elements, so the only obvious implementation that makes sense is this:</p>

"<p>Let me preface this by saying I'm a newbie to Ruby (pretty obvious). I'm learning Ruby on Codecademy and I'm confused by the sort function. To use as an example:</p>

<pre><code>list = [3,2,1,4]
list.sort { |a,b| b &lt;=&gt; a }
</code></pre>

<p>I know that this will return the array in descending order - [4, 3, 2, 1]. What I don't understand is why, exactly. I know that when the sort function is called, the numbers from the array are passed into the function and compared, which then returns either -1, 0, or 1 - but then what? For instance, I'm guessing this is what would be compared first:</p>

<pre><code>[3 &lt;=&gt; 2] = 1
</code></pre>

<p>But what does it do with the 1 that is returned? And what would the array look like after it gets the 1?</p>

<p>I'm confused because I don't understand how reversing the comparison (a &lt;=> b vs. b &lt;=> a) changes the direction in which the array is sorted. Unless I'm mistaken, doesn't ""1 &lt;=> 2"" essentially return ""1 comes before 2"", whereas ""2 &lt;=> 1"" returns ""2 comes after 1""? Which is more or less the same thing, yet the results are obviously different.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>No and yes. The question that is asked of the block is: ""does the left element come before or after the right?"" And by swapping left and right, you swap the order.</p>

<p>So, the answer is: you aren't reversing the comparison per se, but you are reversing the <code>sort</code> method's idea of which is left and which is right.</p>

<p>The return value of the block is interpreted by <code>sort</code> like this:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>0</code>: order doesn't matter</li>
<li><code>1</code>: the elements are already in the right order</li>
<li><code>-1</code>: the elements are in the wrong order</li>
</ul>

<p>By swapping left and right, you swap whether the block tells <code>sort</code> that the elements are in the right or wrong order.</p>

<p>Note that Quicksort is completely irrelevant here. What matters is the contract of the comparator block. Whether that block is then used by Quicksort, Shellsort, Insertion Sort, Bubblesort, Bogosort, Timsort or whatever other comparison-based sort doesn't really matter.</p>

","2988","","<p>There is no such thing as a function in Ruby, only methods.</p>

<p>If you define a method at the top-level it is an instance method of <code>Object</code>.</p>

<p>If you define a class without a superclass, it's superclass is <code>Object</code>.</p>

<p>So, your <code>A#foo</code> simply overrides <code>Object#foo</code>. And if it overrides <code>Object#foo</code>, it should respect its contract. You should never need to call <code>Object#foo</code> on an <code>A</code>, if <code>A#foo</code> implements <code>Object#foo</code>'s contract correctly (and it should, otherwise it would be a violation of the Liskov Substitution Principle). If you want to reuse <code>Object#foo</code>'s implementation within <code>A#foo</code>, you can defer to the superclass implementation using <code>super</code>.</p>

"<p>I tagged character-encoding and text because I know if you type <code>'and' == 'and'</code> into the rails console, or most any other programming language, you will get <code>true</code>. However, I am having the issue when one of my users pastes his text into my website, I can't spell check it properly or verify it's originality via copyscape because of some issue with the text. (or maybe my understanding of text encoding?)</p>

<p><strong>EXAMPLE:</strong></p>

<p>If you copy and paste the following line into the rails console you will get <code>false</code>.</p>

<pre><code>'and' == 'and' #=&gt; true
</code></pre>

<p>The difference is, in the first example, the first <code>'аnd'</code> is copied and pasted from my user's text that is causing the issues. All the other instances of <code>'and'</code> are typed into the browser.</p>

<p>Is this an encoding issue?
Any ideas on how to fix my issue?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","2988","","<p>The problem is not with encodings. A single file or a single terminal can only have a single encoding. If you copy and paste both strings into the same source file or the same terminal window, they will get inserted with the same encoding.</p>

<p>The problem is also not with normalization or folding.</p>

<p>The first string has 4 octets: <code>0xD0 0xB0 0x6E 0x64</code>. The first two octets are a two-octet UTF-8 encoding of a single Unicode codepoint, the third and fourth octets are one-octet UTF-8 encodings of Unicode code points.</p>

<p>So, the string consists of three Unicode codepoints: <code>U+0430 U+006E U+0064</code>.</p>

<p>These three codepoints resolve to the following three characters:</p>

<ol>
<li>CYRILLIC SMALL LETTER A</li>
<li>LATIN SMALL LETTER N</li>
<li>LATIN SMALL LETTER D</li>
</ol>

<p>The second string has 3 octets: <code>0x61 0x6E 0x64</code>. All three octets are one-octet UTF-8 encodings of Unicode code points.</p>

<p>So, the string consists of three Unicode codepoints: <code>U+0061 U+006E U+0064</code>.</p>

<p>These three codepoints resolve to the following three characters:</p>

<ol>
<li>LATIN SMALL LETTER A</li>
<li>LATIN SMALL LETTER N</li>
<li>LATIN SMALL LETTER D</li>
</ol>

<p>Really, there is no problem <em>at all</em>! The two strings <em>are</em> different. With the font you are using, a cyrillic a looks the same as a latin a, but as far as Unicode is concerned, they are two different characters. (And in a different font, they might even look different!) There's really nothing you can do from an encoding or Unicode perspective, because the problem is not with encodings or Unicode.</p>

<p>This is called a <a href=""https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoglyph"" rel=""nofollow"">homoglyph</a>, two characters that are different but have the same (or very similar) glyphs.</p>

<p>What you <em>could</em> try to do is transliterate all strings into Latin (provided that you can guarantee that nobody ever wants to enter non-Latin characters), but really, the questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Where does that cyrillic a come from?</li>
<li>Maybe it was <em>meant</em> to be a cyrillic a and really <em>should</em> be treated not-equal to a latin a?</li>
</ol>

<p>And depending on the answers to those questions, you might either want to fix the source, or just do nothing at all.</p>

<p>This is a very hot topic for browser vendors, BTW, because nowadays someone could register the domain <code>google.com</code> (with one of the letters switched out for a homoglpyh) and you wouldn't be able to spot the difference in the address bar. This is called a homograph attack. That's why they always display the Punycode domain in addition to the Unicode domain name.</p>

"<p>I'm developing a ruby script for solar calculations using sketchup. The script uses a few input files, generates intermediate calculations results that are saved in a number of files and finally provides the final output in a separate set of files.</p>

<p>The workflow is quite straightforward if all the steps are followed in a specific order from start to finish.</p>

<p>The problem arises when different scenarios need to be analysed. In this case I might introduce changes in the input files, in some global variables and of course this will cause different intermediate results and final outputs. There are two main issues:</p>

<p>1 - if I change some of the parameters and I do not complete the whole process because the script crashed or for any other reason, there is no way for me to know whether the results generated correspond to the current 'state' of the input parameters</p>

<p>2 - the calculations are quite complex and might require a few hours. I would like to avoid calculations that do need to be repeated, but to do this I need to be able to identify the state of the intermediate results.</p>

<p>This is a common problem for several commercial simulation software I have used as well. You set up your model, run a simulation and make some changes to test a different set of input parameters. If you do not run the simulation and re-open the model a few days later, there is no way to check whether the results correspond to the current set of inputs.</p>

<p>Some software partially solve the problem by creating a final file that contains all the inputs and outputs so to be able to regenerate the particular scenario.</p>

<p>To reduce the repetitions, I guess that an approach could be the use of a 'dependency graphs' (not sure it is the right definition) that shows the various dependencies and relationships between all the objects involved in the calculations.</p>

<p>My question is if there is a general approach to solve these kind of problems. I have the feeling that I might have to use UML to build this graph, but I thought that it was better to ask first!</p>

<p>Thanks for any advice.</p>

<p>ADDITIONAL EXPLANATION</p>

<p>I am not a professional programmer. I am an engineer and I am developing this software for my own calculations. It has now become much bigger and complex than I expected to and I have started to realize that there are several other issues that are not related to to calculation algorithm itself but are more related to the architecture and the way a potential user can use the software.</p>

<p>For example. I generate an object (InsolationMap) based on a set of inputs (x1, x2, .. xn). This object is then dumped on a file using Marshal. If I run the simulation again, I first check whether the file InsolationMap.marshal exists, if it does then I know that I do not need to perform the simulation again.</p>

<p>The problem arises when I run the simulation with a different set of parameters (y1, y2, ...yn). My code (as it is at the moment) would skip the simulation and this would be of course wrong. This of course happens because the object is not linked to the input parameters.</p>

<p>Now, some kind of dependency graph would help me first to outline all the possible dependencies (my original question). Additionally, I wonder whether I need to code all the checks my self or there are alternative approaches. I was thinking to signing the output file with the input parameters so that I could check whether the new set of inputs actually matches the signature. </p>

<p>I hope this clarifies a bit.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>So, we cannot decide whether two functions compute the same result. What we <em>could</em> do, is for example, check whether they contain the exact same code. But that is pretty boring.

Or, they are just instance methods of the class of a class, which is <code>Class</code> or any of its superclasses (<code>Module</code>, <code>Object</code>, <code>BasicObject</code>).)</p>

<p>In fact, I am surprised that you haven't come across some class methods that modify the class already! Here are some examples:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Module#private</code> without arguments: sets the default visibility for methods defined after it to <code>private</code></li>
<li><code>Module#protected</code> without arguments: sets the default visibility for methods defined after it to <code>protected</code></li>
<li><code>Module#public</code> without arguments: sets the default visibility for methods defined after it to <code>public</code></li>
<li><code>Module#attr_reader</code> generates a getter method</li>
<li><code>Module#attr_writer</code> generates a setter method</li>
<li><code>Module#attr_accessor</code> generates a getter/setter method pair</li>
<li><code>Module#include</code> mixes a module into the inheritance chain as a superclass</li>
<li><code>Module#prepend</code> mixes a module into the inheritance chain right below</li>
<li><code>Module#alias_method</code> creates a copy of a method</li>
<li><code>Module#const_set</code> sets a constant</li>
<li><code>Module#remove_const</code> removes a constant</li>
<li><code>Module#class_variable_set</code> sets a class variable</li>
<li><code>Module#remove_class_variable</code> removes a class variable</li>
<li><code>Module#define_method</code> defines a method</li>
<li><code>Module#undef_method</code> undefines a method</li>
<li><code>Module#remove_method</code> removes a method</li>
<li><code>Module#refine</code> creates a refinement</li>
<li><code>Module#using</code> activates a refinement</li>
</ul>

<p>I am very surprised that you haven't come across <code>alias_method</code>, <code>private</code> or <code>attr_*</code> yet.</p>

"<p>I'm surprised by a particular bit of syntax-sensitivity in Ruby.  These all work:</p>

<pre><code> var = method arg
 var2 = (var1 = method arg)
 method2(method1 arg)
</code></pre>

<p>But this does not:</p>

<pre><code>method2(var = method1 arg)
</code></pre>

<p>Instead, I have to do either this, with extra parentheses:</p>

<pre><code>method2(var = method1(arg))
</code></pre>

<p>..or this, which I find much more ambiguous than the version that fails:</p>

<pre><code>method2 var = method1(arg)
</code></pre>

<p>I assume that this is either a specific design decision or the side effect of another one, and would appreciate any insight into those decisions.   </p>

<p>Please note that I'm not looking for any opinions about style; I'm not asking what looks better, or what you think should or should not work.

<p>Ruby's syntax is ridiculously complex. And since most Ruby implementations use a parser generator like Bison, which however isn't actually powerful enough to parse such a ridiculously complex language, <a href=""https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/trunk/parse.y"" rel=""nofollow"">the parsers tend to be even more ridiculously complex</a>. It's much more likely that it's two weird parsing corner cases interacting in an even weirder way than any sort of conscious design decision. </p>

"<p>Hi I am studying the scala language and have a question. I am reading a book and one of the example says that 0 to 2 is same as (0).to(2). How can I interpret this syntax?? I mean, I can see that to is a function that takes one integer value as its parameter. But what is ""(0)."" part?? Thanks</p>
","2988","","<blockquote>
  <p>I mean, I can see that <code>to</code> is a function that takes one integer value as its parameter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, it's not a function, it's a method.</p>

<p>Methods are invoked by sending a message to an object:</p>

<pre><code>foo.bar(baz)
</code></pre>

<p>This means ""send the message <code>bar</code> with the object referenced by <code>baz</code> as argument to the object referenced by <code>foo</code>. This will in turn cause the method <code>bar</code> in <code>foo</code>'s class or one of its ancestors to be invoked.</p>

<p>So, <code>to</code> is the message, <code>2</code> is the argument, and <code>0</code> is the receiver of the message.</p>

<p>Scala allows you to use either a <code>.</code> or whitespace for message sending:</p>

<pre><code>foo bar(baz)
// is the same as
foo.bar(baz)
</code></pre>

<p>Also, when using whitespace for message sending, you can leave off the parentheses of the last argument list if it has only a single argument:</p>

<pre><code>foo bar baz
// is the same as
foo bar(baz)
</code></pre>

<p>And lastly, parentheses are not only used for argument lists, they are also used for grouping. (And tuple literals as well.) You can always surround an expression with parentheses to clarify its precedence:</p>

<pre><code>(foo).bar(baz)
// is the same as
foo.bar(baz)
</code></pre>

"<p>The object_id of 0 is 1, of 1 is 3, of 2 is 5.</p>

<p>Why is this pattern like this? What is behind the Fixnums that make to create that pattern of object_ids? I would expect that if 0 has id 1, 1 has id 2, 2 has id 3.. And so on.</p>

<p>What am I missing?</p>
","2988","","<p>First things first: the <em>only</em> thing that the Ruby Language Specification guarantees about <code>object_id</code>s is that they are unique <em>in space</em>. That's it. They aren't even unique in time.</p>

<p>So, at any given time there can only be one object with a specific <code>object_id</code> <em>at the same time</em>, however, <em>at different times</em>, <code>object_id</code>s may be reused for different objects.</p>

<p>To be fully precise: what Ruby guarantees is that</p>

<ul>
<li><code>object_id</code> will be an <code>Integer</code></li>
<li>no two objects will have the same <code>object_id</code> at the same time</li>
<li>an object will have the same <code>object_id</code> over its entire lifetime</li>
</ul>

<p>What you are seeing is a side-effect of how <code>object_id</code> and <code>Fixnum</code>s are implemented in YARV. This is a private internal implementation detail of YARV that is not guaranteed in any way. Other Ruby implementations may (and do) implement them differently, so this is not guaranteed to be true across Ruby implementations. It is not even guaranteed to be true across different versions of YARV, or even for the same version on different platforms.</p>

<p>And in fact, it actually <em>did</em> change quite recently, and it <em>is</em> different between 32-bit and 64-bit platforms.</p>

<p>In YARV, <code>object_id</code> is simply implemented as returning the memory address of the object. That's one piece of the puzzle.</p>

<p>Nut, why are the memory addresses of <code>Fixnum</code>s so regular? Well, actually, in <em>this</em> case, they <em>aren't</em> memory addresses! YARV uses a special trick to encode some objects into pointers. There are some pointers which aren't actually being used, and so you can use them to encode certain things.</p>

<p>This is called a <em>tagged pointer</em> representation, and is a pretty common optimization trick used in many different interpreters, VMs and runtime systems for decades. Pretty much every Lisp implementation uses them, many Smalltalk VMs, many Ruby interpreters, and so on.</p>

<p>Usually, in those languages, you always pass around pointers to objects. An object itself consists of an object header, which contains object metadata (like the type of an object, its class(es), maybe access control restrictions or security annotations and so on), and then the actual object data itself. So, a simple integer would be represented as a pointer plus an object consisting of metadata and the actual integer. Even with a very compact representation, that's something like 6 Byte for a simple integer.</p>

<p>Also, you cannot pass such an integer object to the CPU to perform fast integer arithmetic. If you want to add two integers, you <em>really</em> only have two pointers, which point to the beginning of the object headers of the two integer objects you want to add. So, you first need to perform integer arithmetic on the first pointer to add the offset into the object to it where the integer data is stored. Then you have to dereference that address. Do the same again with the second integer. Now you have two integers you can actually ask the CPU to add. Of course, you need to now construct a new integer object to hold the result.</p>

<p>So, in order to perform <em>one</em> integer addition, you actually need to perform <em>three</em> integer additions plus two pointer dererefences plus one object construction. And you take up almost 20 bytes.</p>

<p>However, the trick is that with so-called <em>immutable value types</em> like integers, you usually don't <em>need</em> all the metadata in the object header: you can just leave all that stuff out, and simply synthesize it (which is VM-nerd-speak for ""fake it""), when anyone cares to look. A fixnum will <em>always</em> have class <code>Fixnum</code>, there's no need to separately store that information. If someone uses reflection to figure out the class of a fixnum, you simply reply <code>Fixnum</code> and nobody will ever know that you didn't actually store that information in the object header and that in fact, there <em>isn't</em> even an object header (or an object).</p>

<p>So, the trick is to store the value <em>of</em> the object within the pointer <em>to</em> the object, effectively collapsing the two into one.</p>

<p>There are CPUs which actually have additional space within a pointer (so-called <em>tag bits</em>) that allow you to store extra information about the pointer within the pointer itself. Extra information like ""this isn't actually a pointer, this is an integer"". Examples include the Burroughs B5000, the various Lisp Machines or the AS/400. Unfortunately, most of the current mainstream CPUs don't have that feature.</p>

<p>However, there is a way out: most current mainstream CPUs work significantly slower when addresses aren't aligned on word boundaries. Some even don't support unaligned access at all.</p>

<p>What this means is that in practice, <em>all</em> pointers will be divisible by 4 (on a 32-bit system, 8 on a 64-bit system), which means they will <em>always</em> end with two (three on a 64-bit system) <code>0</code> bits. This allows us to distinguish between <em>real</em> pointers (that end in <code>00</code>) and pointers which are actually integers in disguise (those that end with <code>1</code>). And it still leaves us with all pointers that end in <code>10</code> free to do other stuff. Also, most modern operating systems reserve the very low addresses for themselves, which gives us another area to mess around with (pointers that start with, say, 24 <code>0</code>s and end with <code>00</code>).</p>

<p>So, you can encode a 31-bit (or 63-bit) integer into a pointer, by simply shifting it 1 bit to the left and adding <code>1</code> to it. And you can perform <em>very fast</em> integer arithmetic with those, by simply shifting them appropriately (sometimes not even that is necessary).</p>

<p>What do we do with those other address spaces? Well, typical examples include encoding <code>float</code>s in the other large address space and a number of special objects like <code>true</code>, <code>false</code>, <code>nil</code>, the 127 ASCII characters, some commonly used short strings, the empty list, the empty object, the empty array and so on near the <code>0</code> address.</p>

<p>In YARV, integers are encoded the way I described above, <code>false</code> is encoded as address <code>0</code> (which just so happens <em>also</em> to be the representation of <code>false</code> in C), <code>true</code> as address <code>2</code> (which just so happens to be the C representation of <code>true</code> shifted by one bit) and <code>nil</code> as <code>4</code>.</p>

<p>In <a href=""https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/trunk/include/ruby/ruby.h#L391-L397"" rel=""nofollow"">YARV</a>, the following bit patterns are used to encode certain special objects:</p>

<pre><code>xxxx xxxx … xxxx xxx1    Fixnum
xxxx xxxx … xxxx xx10    flonum
0000 0000 … 0000 1100    Symbol
0000 0000 … 0000 0000    false
0000 0000 … 0000 1000    nil
0000 0000 … 0001 0100    true
0000 0000 … 0011 0100    undefined
</code></pre>

<p><code>Fixnum</code>s are 63-bit integers that fit into a single machine word, <code>flonum</code>s are 62-bit <code>Float</code>s that fit into a single machine word. <code>false</code>, <code>nil</code> and <code>true</code> are what you would expect, <code>undefined</code> is a value that is only used inside the implementation but not exposed to the programmer.</p>

<p>Note that on 32-bit platforms, <code>flonum</code>s aren't used (there's no point in using 30-bit <code>Float</code>s), and so the bit patterns are different. <code>nil.object_id</code> is <code>4</code> on 32-bit platforms, not <code>8</code> like on 64-bit platforms, for example.</p>

<p>So, there you have it:</p>

<ul>
<li>certain small integers are encoded as pointers</li>
<li>pointers are used for <code>object_id</code>s</li>
</ul>

<p>Therefore</p>

<ul>
<li>certain small integers have predictable <code>object_id</code>s</li>
</ul>

"<p>I'm a self taught programmer and started off with Ruby. I'm currently trying to learn algorithms and data structures and noticed something called a linked list. It looks like Ruby doesn't have that data structure (maybe in Array?). I'm familiar with arrays and hashes.</p>

<p>How would you describe/explain what a linked list is for someone coming from my background?</p>
","2988","","<p>Linked lists are rather simple: they are lists which are created by linking the elements together. (Kind of obvious, when you think about it, no?)</p>

<p>In its most basic form, a linked list is simply either empty or a pair. The first element of the pair is a value, and the second element of the pair is a linked list representing the rest of the values.</p>

<p>Traditionally, the pair is called a <em>cons cell</em>, the first element is called the <em>head</em> or the <em>car</em> of the list and the second element is called the <em>tail</em> or the <em>cdr</em> of the list. The empty list is called <code>Nil</code> or simply <code>[]</code>.</p>

<p>Here is an extremely simple implementation of a linked list in Ruby, which uses nothing but functions to implement a linked list (and booleans and conditionals, while we're at it):</p>

<pre><code>True   = -&gt;(iff, _) { iff }
False  = -&gt;(_, els) { els }

Pair   = -&gt;(first, rest) { -&gt; x { x.(first, rest) }}
First  = -&gt; list { list.(True ) }
Rest   = -&gt; list { list.(False) }
</code></pre>

<p>Here, we have a simple list with three elements:</p>

<pre><code>List   = Pair.(1, Pair.(2, Pair.(3, nil)))

First.(Rest.(List))
# =&gt; 2
</code></pre>

<p>A more realistic object-oriented encoding of a list looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>class List
  def cons(el) Pair.new(el, self) end

  Empty = new

  class Pair &lt; self
    attr_reader :first, :rest

    def initialize(first, rest=Empty)
      self.first, self.rest = first, rest
    end

    private

    attr_writer :first, :rest
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Again, a list with two elements:</p>

<pre><code>list1 = List::Pair.new(1, List::Pair.new(2, List::Pair.new(3, List::Empty)))
# corresponds to the list [1, 2, 3]

list1.rest.first
# =&gt; 2

list2 = List::Empty.cons(6).cons(5).cons(4)
# List[4, 5, 6]

list2.rest.first
# =&gt; 5
</code></pre>

<p>A more complete and Rubyish implementation might look like this:</p>

<pre><code>class List
  include Enumerable

  def self.[](*els) els.reverse_each.inject(Empty, &amp;:cons) end

  def cons(el) Pair[el, self] end

  def prepend(prefix)
    case
    when        empty? then prefix
    when prefix.empty? then self
    else prepend(prefix.rest).cons(prefix.first)
    end
  end

  def to_s; ""List[#{map(&amp;:to_s).join(', ')}]"" end
  def inspect; ""List[#{map(&amp;:inspect).join(', ')}]"" end

  def each; return enum_for(__method__) unless block_given? end

  class &lt;&lt; Empty = new
    def empty?; true end
    alias_method :inspect, def to_s; 'Empty' end

    freeze
  end
  Empty.freeze

  class Pair &lt; self
    def initialize(first, rest=Empty)
      self.first, self.rest = first, rest
      freeze
    end

    def empty?; false end

    def each(&amp;blk)
      return super unless block_given?
      yield first
      rest.each(&amp;blk)
    end

    private
    attr_writer :first, :rest

    protected
    attr_reader :first, :rest

    class &lt;&lt; self; alias_method :[], :new end

    freeze
  end

  freeze
end
</code></pre>

<p>Some examples:</p>

<pre><code>list1 = List::Pair[1, List::Pair[2, List::Pair[3, List::Empty]]]
# =&gt; List[1, 2, 3]

list2 = List::Empty.cons(6).cons(5).cons(4)

"<p>In the book Functional Programming in Scala MEAP v10, the author mentions</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Polymorphic functions are often so constrained by their type that they only have one implementation!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and gives the example</p>

<pre><code>def partial1[A,B,C](a: A, f: (A,B) =&gt; C): B =&gt; C = (b: B) =&gt; f(a, b)
</code></pre>

<p>What does he mean by this statement? Are polymorphic functions restrictive?</p>
","2988","","<p>Here's a simpler example:</p>

<pre><code>def mysteryMethod[A, B](somePair: (A, B)): B = ???
</code></pre>

<p>What does this method do? It turns out, that there is only <em>one</em> thing this method can do! You don't need the name of the method, you don't need the implementation of the method, you don't need any documentation. The <em>type</em> tells you everything it could possibly do, and it turns out that ""everything"" in this case is exactly <em>one</em> thing.</p>

<p>So, what does it do? It takes a pair <code>(A, B)</code> and returns some value of type <code>B</code>. What value does it return? Can it construct a value of type <code>B</code>? No, it can't, because it doesn't know what <code>B</code> is! Can it return a random value of type <code>B</code>? No, because randomness is a side-effect and thus would have to appear in the type signature. Can it go out in the universe and fetch some <code>B</code>? No, because <em>that</em> would be a side-effect and would have to appear in the type signature!</p>

<p>In fact, the <em>only</em> thing it can do is return the value of type <code>B</code> that was passed into it, the second element of the pair. So, this <code>mysteryMethod</code> is really the <code>second</code> method, and its only sensible implementation is:</p>

<pre><code>def second[A, B](somePair: (A, B)): B = somePair._2
</code></pre>

<p>Note that in reality, since Scala is neither pure nor total, there are in fact a couple of other things the method could do: throw an exception (i.e. return abnormally), go into an infinite loop (i.e. not return at all), use reflection to figure out the actual type of <code>B</code> and reflectively invoke the constructor to fabricate a new value, etc.</p>

<p>However, assuming purity (the return value may only depend on the arguments), totality (the method must return a value normally) and parametricity (it <em>really</em> doesn't know anything about <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>), then there is in fact an awful lot you can tell about a method by <em>only</em> looking at its type.</p>

<p>Here's another example:</p>

<pre><code>def mysteryMethod(someBoolean: Boolean): Boolean = ???
</code></pre>

<p>What could this do? It could always return <code>false</code> and ignore its argument. But then it would be overly constrained: if it always ignores its argument, then it doesn't care that it is a <code>Boolean</code> and its type would rather be</p>

<pre><code>def alwaysFalse[A](something: A): Boolean = false // same for true, obviously
</code></pre>

<p>It could always just return its argument, but again, then it wouldn't actually care about booleans, and its type would rather be</p>

<pre><code>def identity[A](something: A): A = something
</code></pre>

<p>So, really, the only thing it can do is return a <em>different</em> boolean than the one that was passed in, and since there are only two booleans, we know that our mysteryMethod is, in fact, <code>not</code>:</p>

<pre><code>def not(someBoolean: Boolean): Boolean = if (someBoolean) false else true
</code></pre>

<p>So, here, we have an example, where the types don't give us <em>the</em> implementation, but at least, they give as a (small) set of 4 possible implementations, only one of which makes sense.</p>

<p>(By the way: it turns out that there is only one possible implementation of a method which takes an <code>A</code> and returns an <code>A</code>, and it is the identity method shown above.)</p>

<p>So, to recap:</p>

<ul>
<li>purity means that you can only use the building blocks that were handed to you (the arguments)</li>
<li>a strong, strict, static type system means that you can only use those building blocks in such a way that their types line up</li>
<li>totality means that you can't do stupid things (like infinite loops or throwing exceptions)</li>
<li>parametricity means that you cannot make any assumptions at all about your type variables</li>
</ul>

<p>Think about your arguments as parts of a machine and your types as connectors on those machine parts. There will only be a limited number of ways that you can connect those machine parts together in a way that you only plug together compatible connectors and you don't have any leftover parts. Often enough, there will be only one way, or if there are multiple ways, then often one will be obviously the right one.</p>

<p>What this means is that, once you have designed the types of your objects and methods, you won't even have to <em>think</em> about how to implement those methods, because the types will already dictate the only possible way to implement them! Considering how many questions on StackOverflow are basically ""how do I implement this?"", can you imagine how freeing it must be not having to think about that <em>at all</em>, because the types already dictate the one (or one of a few) possible implementation?</p>

<p>Now, look at the signature of the method in your question and try playing around with different ways to combine <code>a</code> and <code>f</code> in such a way that the types line up and you use both <code>a</code> and <code>f</code> and you will indeed see that there is only one way to do that. (As Chris and Paul have shown.)</p>

"<p>I often need to get the pure class name of an object, as code below:</p>

<pre><code>class Foo
    class Bar

    end
end
obj = Foo::Bar.new
puts obj.class.name  # It shows ""Foo::Bar"", while what I want is just ""Bar""
</code></pre>

<p>I know it can be done by obj.class.name.split('::').last, but, shouldn't be there a method just return ""Bar"" ?</p>
","2988","","<p>Classes don't really have ""names"" in Ruby. A class is an object like any other object, it gets assigned to variables like any other object. A class doesn't have a name, just like a number or a string doesn't have a name.</p>

<p>Take this example:</p>

<pre><code>foo = Class.new

Bar = foo
Baz = foo

Bar = nil
remove_const :Bar
</code></pre>

<p>What should the ""name"" of the class be in this example?</p>

<p>Well, there <em>is</em> a method called <code>name</code> in the <code>Module</code> class. What it does is the following: <em>if</em> the class object has been assigned to a constant for the first time, the name of that constant (note that even <em>that</em> is a fuzzy concept!) becomes the name of the class, otherwise the name will just be <code>nil</code>.</p>

<p>Expanding on the example above:</p>

<pre><code>foo = Class.new

foo.name
# =&gt; nil

Bar = foo

foo.name
# =&gt; 'Bar'
Bar.name
# =&gt; 'Bar'

Baz = foo

Baz.name
# =&gt; 'Bar'

Bar = nil
remove_const :Bar

foo.name
# =&gt; 'Bar'
</code></pre>

<p>Here's another example:</p>

<pre><code>foo = Class.new
Bar = foo
Baz = foo

class Baz
  class Quux; end

  Xyzzy = Quux
end

foo::Xyzzy.name
# =&gt; 'Bar::Quux'
</code></pre>

<p>Note that even though <code>Quux</code> is defined inside <code>Baz</code> and accessed via <code>foo::Xyzzy</code> it still prints <code>Bar::Quux</code> as its name.</p>

<p>Also, two different classes can have the same name:</p>

<pre><code>Foo = Class.new

Bar = Foo

Foo = nil
remove_const :Foo

Foo = Class.new

Baz = Foo

Foo = nil
remove_const :Foo

Bar.name
# =&gt; Foo

Baz.name
# =&gt; Foo

Bar == Baz
# =&gt; false
</code></pre>

<p>The ""name"" of a class is simply a debugging help for human readers, you should <em>never</em> use it for anything else, and never use it programmatically (or even depend on a specific structure of the string).</p>

","2988","","<p>A class is nothing special. It is just an object assigned to a variable, or in the case of the code you showed, a constant.

</code></pre>

<p>Note that the code in the other two answers only works accidentally: they look up <code>Foo</code> in the context of the <code>Module</code> class, which only works because you have <em>actually</em> defined <code>Foo</code> in <code>Object</code> and <code>Module</code> inherits from <code>Object</code>.

","2988","","<p>IRb <em>always</em> displays the result of calling <code>inspect</code> on the value of the last expression that was evaluated.

<p><em>Everything</em> returns a value in Ruby, i.e. <em>everything</em> is an expression, there is no such thing as a statement in Ruby.</p>

<p>In the past, the return value of a method definition expression was undefined. Most Ruby implementations simply returned <code>nil</code> from a method definition expression, but Rubinius for example returned the <code>CompiledMethod</code> object for the method that was defined.</p>

<p>With Ruby 2.1, <a href=""https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/3753"" rel=""nofollow"">the return value of a method definition expression was standardized to be the <code>Symbol</code> corresponding to the method's name</a>. This allows you to use the method definition expression as an argument in methods that expect the name of a method as an argument.</p>

alias_method :collect, :map

# After Ruby 2.0:
alias_method :collect, def map; end

","2988","","<p><em>Theoretically</em>, if you document clearly that the return value is meaningless, then you could just incidentally return whatever the last expression in the method happens to evaluate to.</p>

<p><em>Practically</em>, however, nobody reads documentation, so, if your method <em>does</em> return something, then people <em>will</em> come to depend on it. Also, depending on what exactly it is that you are ""accidentally"" returning, you might leak private internal implementation details of your method or you might even break encapsulation of your object by e.g. returning the value of a private instance variable.</p>

<p>Take the <code>defined?</code> unary prefix operator, for example. It is specified as returning either a trueish or a falseish value. However, on MRI, it does not just return any trueish value, it actually returns a <code>String</code> describing the kind of expression that is asked about (e.g. <code>'local-variable'</code>, <code>'method'</code>, etc.) And people have become so dependent on this return value that all other Ruby implementations just <em>have</em> to mimic it, even though it is nowhere documented. Now, it turns out that for MRI this information is trivially available, but for JRuby it is not, and keeping this information around incurs a performance penalty.</p>

<p>The E programming language is a purely expression-based language like Ruby or Lisp. Everything is an expression, there are no statements. Everything returns a value. However, unlike those other languages, the implicit return value of a subroutine is not the value of the last expression evaluated inside the subroutine, it is <code>nil</code>. You <em>must</em> explicitly <code>return</code> a value if you want to return something meaningful. That is because the creator of E believes that it is too dangerous to accidentally return something you didn't want. (E is explicitly designed for security, safety, integrity and reliability.)</p>

"<p>Make a RECURSIVE ruby function ""double_fact(n)"" defined as follows –

"<p>Is there a better method to display a number in hex with leading <code>0</code>? I tried:</p>

<pre><code>i.to_s(16)
</code></pre>

<p>but</p>

<pre><code>2.to_s(16) #=&gt; ""2"" 
</code></pre>

<p>where I expect <code>""02""</code>. I tried the print format:</p>

<pre><code>""%02x"" % i
</code></pre>

<p>which works for <code>2</code>, but</p>

<pre><code>""%02x"" % 256 #=&gt; ""100""
</code></pre>

<p>where I want <code>""0100""</code>. So I came up with this:</p>

<pre><code>class Integer
  def to_hex_string
    (""%0x"" % self).size % 2 == 0 ? ""%0x"" % self : ""%0#{(""%0x"" % self).size+1}x"" % self
  end
end

<p>It works:</p>

<pre><code>2.to_hex_string #=&gt; ""02""
256.to_hex_string #=&gt; ""0100""
</code></pre>

<p>It works also with class <code>Bignumber</code>, but it looks strange that such an easy request needs a trick like this. Any better idea?</p>
","2988","","<p>You are making this way too complicated. If you want to print an integer in hexadecimal with a leading zero, then it is just </p>

<pre><code>class Integer
  def to_hex_string
    ""0#{to_s(16)}""

2.to_hex_string   # =&gt; 02
256.to_hex_string # =&gt; 0100

","2988","","<p>Objects don't have names. They may or may not be referenced by one or more variables, but there is no way to know what variables reference an object and what the names of those variables are.</p>

<p>Modules are a special case, their <code>name</code> method indeed returns the name of the first constant that they have been assigned to, but that is interpreter magic.</p>

"<p>I am learning Scala and I noticed something about using the return statement.</p>

<p>So, obviously in Scala, if you don't have a return statement, the last value is returned by default. Which is great. But if you use the return statement without specifying the return type, Scala says <code>""error: method testMethod has return statement; needs result type""</code></p>

<p>So this works</p>

<pre><code>  def testMethod(arg: Int) = {
    arg*2
  }
</code></pre>

<p>but this gives the error</p>

<pre><code>  def testMethod(arg: Int) = {
    return arg*2
  }
</code></pre>

<p>This makes me scratch my chin and go</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mmmmmmmm... There must be a reason for that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why is the explicit type declaration needed when you use a return statement but not when you let Scala return the last value? I assumed they were exactly the same thing, and that return statements are just for if you want to return a value inside a nested function/conditional, etc. (In other words, that a ""return"" statement is automatically inserted to your last value by the compiler.. if not present anywhere else in the method)</p>

<p>But clearly I was wrong. Surely there must be some other difference in the implementation?</p>

<p>Am I missing something?</p>
","2988","","<p>If you have multiple exit points from your method, it may be impossible for the compiler to infer the return type. The only way you can get multiple exit points from your method, is by using multiple <code>return</code>s. (Or one <code>return</code> plus the implicit return.)</p>

<p>Since the rules, when it works and when it doesn't, are pretty complex, it may look to the user that it sometimes randomly works and sometimes doesn't. Simply forbidding type inference altogether in the presence of an explicit <code>return</code> is a much simpler rule, even if a bit restrictive.</p>

","2988","","<p>This has absolutely nothing to do with using Cucumber with Java. The error message you are getting is from the Windows command line and telling you that it couldn't find <code>cucumber</code> anywhere. Either you didn't install it, or you didn't put it in your <code>%PATH%</code>, or its extension is not in <code>%PATHEXT%</code>.</p>

"<p>Usually Arrays are implemented as a chunks of memory, sets as hash maps, and sorted sets as skip lists. Is that also the case in Ruby? </p>

<p>I'm trying to evaluate the use of different containers in Ruby in terms of performance and memory footprint </p>
","2988","","<p>Arrays are part of the Ruby core library. Each Ruby implementation has its own implementation of arrays. The Ruby Language Specification only specifies the behavior of Ruby arrays, it does not specify any particular implementation strategy. It doesn't even specify any performance constraints that would force or at least suggest a particular implementation strategy.</p>

<p>However, most Rubyists have some expectation about the performance characteristics of arrays that would force an implementation that doesn't meet them into obscurity, because nobody would actually use it:</p>

<ul>
<li>inserting, prepending or appending as well as deleting an element has a worst-case step-complexity of O(n) and an amortized worst-case step-complexity of O(1)</li>
<li>accessing an element has a worst-case step-complexity of O(1)</li>
<li>iterating over all elements has a worst-case step-complexity of O(n)</li>
</ul>

<p>This means that arrays need to be implemented as dynamic arrays with exponential resizing, otherwise those performance guarantees couldn't be met. You <em>might</em> get away with a very wide and shallow tree, but AFAIK no Ruby implementation does that.</p>

<p>Here's <a href=""https://github.com/rubinius/rubinius/blob/master/vm/builtin/array.cpp#L214-243"" rel=""nofollow"">Rubinius's array implementation</a>, which I personally find the easiest to read of all Ruby implementations. (Note: only the bare essentials are implemented in C++, most of the array methods are implemented in Ruby, e.g. in <a href=""https://github.com/rubinius/rubinius/blob/master/kernel/common/array.rb"" rel=""nofollow""><code>kernel/common/array.rb</code></a>).</p>

<p><code>Set</code> and <code>SortedSet</code> are part of the <code>set</code> library in the stdlib. The stdlib is shared mostly unchanged between Ruby implementations (at least the parts that are actually written in Ruby, obviously the parts written in other languages can't be shared), and since <code>Set</code> is written in Ruby, you can expect it to the same on all Ruby implementations.</p>

<p><code>Set</code> is implemented as a <code>Hash</code>, where only the keys are used, the values are simply always <code>true</code>: see <a href=""https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/trunk/lib/set.rb#L289-293"" rel=""nofollow""><code>Set#add</code> in <code>lib/set.rb</code></a>.</p>

<p><code>SortedSet</code> is backed by a Red-Black-Tree that isn't implemented in Ruby.</p>

"<p>I was wondering what is happening with my output. When I run this code it will work fine, I pass in my file name (ex15_sample.txt) and then it will print it out. After it is done printing out the file it prints out two additional characters ""PS"". Any idea on why this is?</p>

<p>I'm running Ruby 2.0.0p576 (x64) on a windows 8 64 bit machine.</p>

<p>Here is my code:</p>

<pre><code># Prompts the user for input on the filename
print ""What is the name of the file you would like printed? ""

# Takes a command line argument and assigns it to the variable
filename = gets.chomp

# Declares another variable and initializes it by opening the file stored in the variable filename
txt = open(filename)

# Prints out a string with an interpolated string
puts ""Here's your file #{filename}:""
# Prints out the file stored in the variable txt
print txt.read
# Closes the file
txt.close()
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT: As a side note, if I open the file, read and print it using <code>irb</code> I do not get the extra characters. Only if I use the command <code>ruby ex15.rb</code></p>
","2988","","<p>PS is the PowerShell prompt. It gets printed by PowerShell after every command. This has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with Ruby. Try running <code>dir</code> and it will also print PS.</p>

"<p>I've been reading a lot of other people's Scala code recently, and one of the things that I have  difficultly with (coming from Java) is a lack of explicit type annotations.</p>

<p>It's certainly convenient when writing code to be able to leave out type annotations -- however when reading code I often find that explicit type annotations help me to understand at a glance what code is doing more easily.</p>

<p>The Scala style guide (<a href=""http://docs.scala-lang.org/style/types.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.scala-lang.org/style/types.html</a>) doesn't seem to provide any definitive guidance on this, stating:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Use type inference where possible, but put clarity first, and favour explicitness in public APIs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To my mind, this is a bit contradictory. While it's clearly obvious what type this variable is:</p>

<pre><code>val tokens = new HashMap[String, Int]
</code></pre>

<p>It's not so obvious what type this one is:</p>

<pre><code>val tokens = readTokens()
</code></pre>

<p>So, if I was putting clarity first I would probably annotate all variables where the type is not already declared on the same line.</p>

<p>Do any Scala practitioners have guidance on this? Am I crazy to be considering adding type annotations to my local variables? I'm particularly interested in hearing from folks who spend a lot of time reading scala code (for example, in code reviews), as well as writing it.</p>
","2988","","<blockquote>
  <p>It's not so obvious what type this one is:</p>

<pre><code>val tokens = readTokens()
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Good names are important: the name is plural, ergo it returns some collection of some kind. The most general collection types in Scala are <code>Traversable</code> and <code>Iterator</code>, and they mostly share a common interface, so it's not really important which one of the two it is. The name also talks about ""reading tokens"", ergo it obviously should return <code>Token</code>s in some fashion. And last but not least, the method call has parentheses, which according to the style guide means it has side-effects, so I wouldn't count on being able to traverse the collection more than once.</p>

<p>Ergo, the return type is something like </p>

<pre><code>Traversable[Token]
</code></pre>

<p>or </p>

<pre><code>Iterator[Token]
</code></pre>

<p>and which of the two it is doesn't really matter because their client interfaces are mostly identical.</p>

<p>Note also that the latter constraint (only traversing the collection once) isn't even captured in the type, even if you <em>were</em> providing an explicit type, you would <em>still</em> have to look at the name and the style!</p>

"<p>I wasn't sure what to title this question, so if you wan't to change it, be my guest.</p>

<p>I am wondering if there is some way to run a block of Ruby code in compliance with a previos version of the ruby language. It would essentially be some sort of 'compatability mode' but only for a block of code.</p>

<p>My idea was to chagne the RUBY_VERSION global variable, and see if Ruby then behaved as it would in that version, but this seems to do nothing. Here is my attempt:</p>

<pre><code>puts RUBY_VERSION

an_object = Time.now

an_object.tap do |o|
  puts 'in tep function'
end # ===&gt; an_object

RUBY_VERSION = 1.7 #potentially change ruby version to an older version to run legacy code

#attempt to run a function that was not available in version 1.7, (just an example)
an_object.tap do |o|
  puts 'in tep function'
end # ===&gt; an_object

puts RUBY_VERSION

<p>I realize that I could code a conditional, and test the current version of Ruby, and then execute code based on the results of that test, but that doesn't fit my needs, and it would be better to just re-factor all of our unit tests and acceptance tests if it came down to this. </p>
","2988","","<p>Most implementations of Ruby only support a single version of the language. For example, YARV 2.1.4 only supports Ruby 2.1.4, MRI 1.8.7 only supports Ruby 1.8.7, and so on.</p>

"<p>I often have to generate SVG files, and I like doing so with Ruby's Nokogiri. The nice thing about Nokogiri is that it lets you create attributes passing a hash to their ""functions"", like so</p>

<p>Observations:</p>

<ul>
<li>nil_list.count == 3, its length.</li>
<li>nil_list.count(nil) == 1, the number of times nil is present in the list.</li>
<li>nil_list given a block behaves as expected.</li>
</ul>

<p>When I try to recreate it, here's what I come up with:</p>

<pre><code>module Enumerable
  def my_count (find = nil)
    result = 0
    for i in self
      if block_given?
        result += 1 if yield(i)

        result += 1 if i == find
      else return self.length
      end
    end
    return result
  end
end

<p>The problem here is that this doesn't actually count nils if we enter nil in as an argument, since this is the same (according to my code) as there not being an argument.</p>

<p>ie, nil_list.my_count(nil) == 3 instead of 1.</p>

<p>While typing this question I had a slightly different idea:</p>

<pre><code>module Enumerable
  def my_count (find = """")
    result = 0
    for i in self
      if block_given?
        result += 1 if yield(i)

        result += 1 if i == find
      else return self.length
      end
    end
    return result
  end
end

<p>So this fixes the problem I was having with searches for nil, but now nil_list.count("""") == 0 whereas nil_list.my_count("""") == 3. Same issue, just relocated to """" which I assume doesn't ever get used.</p>

And it not only is not written in Ruby, it's also got privileged access to the internals of the execution engine, in particular, it can access the arguments that were passed, which you cannot do from Ruby.</p>

<p>Such overloaded methods appear all over the core library and standard library, but they can't easily be written in Ruby.

<p>As you can see, with threads, program execution is even slower. I assume that threads are being executed coherently(by <code>threads.each { |t| t.join }</code> ). Is there a way to run them simultaneously? Or any other way to speed up ruby-script execution on multi-core computer?</p>

<p>I will appreciate any suggestion.</p>
","2988","","<p>The Ruby Language Specification does not guarantee that threads can actually run in parallel. The vast majority of Ruby implementations are indeed capable of running threads in parallel (e.g. Rubinius, JRuby, IronRuby, MacRuby, Ruby.NET), but MRI and YARV can't.</p>

<p>MRI uses green threads, which it schedules itself, but never schedules in parallel. YARV uses native threads which are scheduled by the OS, but protects them with a Giant VM Lock (GVL) to prevent them from being scheduled in parallel. Note that for both MRI and YARV, this only applies to <em>Ruby</em> threads. MRI can run multiple C threads in parallel to its single interpreter thread, and will do so for I/O, for example; also, C extensions can run multiple C threads in parallel. And YARV only prevents its threads from entering the VM, but when they are in the C library or waiting on I/O or running some C code from a C extension, they may run in parallel.</p>

<p>JRuby and IronRuby use JVM threads and CLI threads, respectively. There is nothing within JRuby and IronRuby which prevents them from running in parallel, but it depends on the JVM or CLI implementation you are using. Not all JVMs do support running threads in parallel, although most mainstream ones are capable of that. And, of course, your operating system needs to support it as well, and you need to actually have multiple cores.</p>

"<p>I know that to find the source location for a method, you can do something like: </p>

"<p>I am trying to make a simplistic implementation of AOP in ruby. I was able to implement before and after advices, I got stuck with around advice.</p>

<p>This is the target class that is going to be advised:</p>

<pre><code>class MyClass
  def method
    puts ""running method""
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>This is the Aspect class to instantiate objects capable of making advices:</p>

<pre><code>class Aspect
  def advise(class_name, method, type, &amp;block)
    class_name.send(:alias_method, :proceed, :method)
    class_name.send(:define_method, :method) do
      case type
      when :before
        yield
        proceed
      when :after
        proceed
        yield
      when :around
        yield(proceed) # * proceed is the old version of the method
      end
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>(*) Yield should execute the block around MyClass#proceed on the current object when method is invoked.</p>

<p>Creating the target and the aspect:</p>

<pre><code>mc = MyClass.new
a = Aspect.new()

<p>Invoking the method without advising it:</p>

<pre><code>puts mc.method

<p>Advising MyClass#method with around:</p>

<pre><code>a.advise(MyClass, :method, :around) do |proceed|
  puts ""First""
  proceed # this is not working *
  puts ""Last""
end

puts mc.method
</code></pre>

<p>(*) I am not being able to pass something to identify the call of proceed, that is the invocation of the old method without the advice.</p>

<p>The output should be:</p>

<pre><code>First
running method
Last

","2988","","<p>In Ruby, a method call looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>receiver.method(arguments)
</code></pre>

<p>Or, you can leave off the receiver if the receiver is <code>self</code>.</p>

<p>So, to call a method named <code>proceed</code> on some receiver, you would write</p>

<pre><code>receiver.proceed
</code></pre>

<p>However, in your implementation, you don't keep track of what the receiver should be, so since you don't know the receiver, you simply cannot call the method.</p>

<p>Note that there are lots of other problems with your approach as well. For example, if you advise multiple methods, you will alias them all to the same method, overwriting each other.</p>

<p>Because it's still the same string it was before.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>No, they are not immutable. In Ruby, strings are mutable.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>because Strings are essentally Arrays of Characters,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They are not. In Ruby, strings are mostly a factory for iterators (<code>each_line</code>, <code>each_char</code>, <code>each_codepoint</code>, <code>each_byte</code>). It implements a subset of the <code>Array</code> protocol, but that does not mean that it is an array.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>and Arrays cannot be changed in memory since they are contiguous.</p>

<p>Wrong, arrays are mutable in Ruby.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yet, as demonstrated below: Instantiating a String than adding characters does not change it's object_id. How does concatenation effect the String in memory?</p>

<p>The Ruby Language Specification does not prescribe any particular in-memory representation of strings. Any representation is fine, as long as it supports the semantics specified in the Ruby Language Specification.</p>
