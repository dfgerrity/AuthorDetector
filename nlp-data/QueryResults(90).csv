QUESTION,USERID,USERNAME,ANSWER
"<p>Is there any means of reflection in Objective-C that would allow you to write generic NSCoding implementations by inspecting the public properties of an object and generating generic implementations of encodeWithCoder: and initWithCoder: .</p>

<p>I'm thinking of something like <a href=""http://xstream.codehaus.org/tutorial.html"" rel=""nofollow"">XStream</a> for Java that allows a generic way to serialize and deserialize Java objects using reflection. Even better would probably be some means of marking properties as things you'd want to serialize or that are transient (like the transient keyword in Java).</p>

<p>I've been reading the documentation on <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/iphone/prerelease/library/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/Archiving/Archiving.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Archives and Serializations Programming Guide</a> for Cocoa. I understand that you want some control over the serialization of your objects, but it is generally a symmetrical process and it seems odd to have to reverse what is coded for serialization to deserialize it. I'm a believer of DRY (don't repeat yourself).</p>
","115730","","<p>(I am the author of the blog post linked to in BJ Homer's comment).  There are a couple caveats to using the code:</p>

<ol>
<li>The target class has to be KVC-compliant.  If you're using Objective-C 2.0 properties for your ivars, then you're all set.  Otherwise, you need to make sure that your class is set up to properly respond to valueForKey: and setValue:forKey: methods.</li>
<li>The code uses an undocumented ""feature"" of the runtime to recursively conform ivar classes to NSCoding.  When compiled, almost all typing information (AFAIK) is stripped out of the code, yet in order to save the ivars, <em>they</em> have to conform to NSCoding as well.  I discovered that if the ivar is an object and I call ivar_getTypeEncoding() on it, I'll get a c string back that looks something like: {#IVAR_CLASS} (Example: {#NSString}).  What I do is get the string between the # and }, create a Class object using NSClassFromString, and recurse on that.</li>
<li>This code will save ALL the ivars.</li>
<li>Use at your own risk (of course)</li>
</ol>

<p>I wrote this mainly as a proof of concept, and there are many instances when this code would fail spectacularly.  For example, in object A has an ivar for B, and B has an ivar for A, then using the code to serialize one or the other would (I believe) cause an infinite loop.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I think it's pretty freaking awesome that Objective-C even allows you to do stuff like in the first place.</p>

"<p>I am very new to the iPhone SDK and have read many threads on RESTful service integration with the iPhone. However I am none the wiser. Can you help?</p>

<p>I have some PHP and a MySQL database string on a server. I POST 3 pieces on information from the iPhone to the PHP which then does some thinking and chatting to the database.</p>

<p>It then returns 1, 2 or 3 values depending on the information POSTed and the database.</p>

<p>Where I am having the problem is capturing and storing the response in a way that can then be analysed on the iPhone.</p>

<p>I have tried returning the data as a string (echo/return), an array, and finally XML. None of which seems to work.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any thoughts on this, or might point me in the right direction?</p>

","115730","","<p>Another alternative is to use the CocoaREST code available on github: <a href=""http://github.com/sdegutis/CocoaREST"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/sdegutis/CocoaREST</a>. It was released only recently, but seems to be under active development and looks like its relatively straightforward to use.</p>

<p>EDIT: As suggested in another answer, yet another approach would be to use an XML format.  I would suggest a specific variant of that: you can use XML, but use plist-formatted XML.  That way you can circumvent the need to parse the XML yourself and simply use something like:</p>

<pre><code>NSArray * myArray = [NSArray arrayWithContentsOfURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@""http://example.com/xmlProducer""]];
</code></pre>

<p>(Similarly, you can create NSDictionary, NSString, etc from a URL)</p>

"<p>I am fairly new to OSX development, so this may be easy but google has not been helpful.</p>

<p>I am trying to bind an action to the media keys you find on newer Apple keyboards (Play, Pause  , etc). It appears that you cannot bind to these keys using the regular hotkey API but it must be possible since iTunes clearly manages. Is there some tricky undocumented API that achieves this? Any help would be much appreciated.</p>
","115730","","<p>From my investigations, the operating system is trapping those key events before they are available to other processes.  I created a CGEventTap, like so:</p>

<pre><code>int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
CFMachPortRef      eventTap;
CFRunLoopSourceRef runLoopSource;

eventTap = CGEventTapCreate(kCGHIDEventTap, kCGHeadInsertEventTap, kCGEventTapOptionListenOnly, kCGEventMaskForAllEvents, myCGEventCallback, NULL);

if (!eventTap) {
	NSLog(@""Couldn't create event tap!"");
    exit(1);
}

runLoopSource = CFMachPortCreateRunLoopSource(kCFAllocatorDefault, eventTap, 0);

CFRunLoopAddSource(CFRunLoopGetCurrent(), runLoopSource, kCFRunLoopCommonModes);

CGEventTapEnable(eventTap, true);

CFRunLoopRun();

CFRelease(eventTap);
CFRelease(runLoopSource);

exit(0);
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>And then the actual event callback is this:</p>

<pre><code>CGEventRef myCGEventCallback(CGEventTapProxy proxy, CGEventType type, CGEventRef event, void *refcon) {
    if (type == kCGEventKeyUp) {
    	CGKeyCode keycode = CGEventGetIntegerValueField(event, kCGKeyboardEventKeycode);
    	NSLog(@""%d"", keycode);
    }

    return event;
}
</code></pre>

<p>What you see logged to the console is that you get normal log methods for function keys (if you're holding down the ""fn"" key as well), but when pressing the media keys, brightness, volume, or eject keys, <strong>nothing</strong> is getting logged.</p>

<p>So from this, it unfortunately appears that there's no way to capture a media key event.  However, I would love to be proved wrong.</p>

<p>EDIT: I forgot to point out that for this to work it either needs to run as root, or you need to turn on access for assistive devices in the ""Universal Access"" pane of System Preferences.</p>

","115730","","<p>You have to set the contentSize property of the UIScrollView.  For example, if your UIScrollView is 320 pixels wide (the width of the screen), then you could do this:</p>

  <p><strong>Note:</strong> Although my particular context is Objective-C, my question actually transcends programming language choice. Also, I tagged it as ""subjective"" since someone is bound to complain otherwise, but I personally think it's almost entirely objective. Also, I'm aware of <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/376090/nsdictionary-with-ordered-keys/"">this related SO question</a>, but since this was a bigger issue, I thought it better to make this a separate question. Please don't criticize the question without reading and understanding it fully. Thanks!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most of us are familiar with the <a href=""http://www.itl.nist.gov/div897/sqg/dads/HTML/dictionary.html"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>dictionary</strong> abstract data type</a> that stores key-value associations, whether we call it a map, dictionary, associative array, hash, etc. depending on our language of choice. A simple definition of a dictionary can be summarized by three properties:</p>

<ol>
<li>Values are accessed by key (as opposed to by index, like an array).</li>
<li>Each key is associated with a value.</li>
<li>Each key must be unique.</li>
</ol>

<p>Any other properties are arguably conveniences or specializations for a particular purpose. For example, some languages (especially scripting languages such as PHP and Python) blur the line between dictionaries and arrays and do provide ordering for dictionaries. As useful as this can be, such additions are not a fundamental characteristics of a dictionary. In a pure sense, the actual implementation details of a dictionary are irrelevant.</p>

<p>For my question, the most important observation is that <strong>the order in which keys are enumerated is not defined</strong> — a dictionary may provide keys in whatever order it finds most convenient, and it is up to the client to organize them as desired.</p>

<p>I've <a href=""http://dysart.cs.byu.edu/CHDataStructures/interface%5Fc%5Fh%5Flockable%5Fdictionary.html"" rel=""nofollow"">created custom dictionaries</a> that impose specific key orderings, including <em>natural sorted order</em> (based on object comparisons) and <em>insertion order</em>. It's obvious to name the former some variant on <strong>SortedDictionary</strong> (which I've actually already implemented), but the latter is more problematic. I've seen <a href=""http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/LinkedHashMap.html"" rel=""nofollow"">LinkedHashMap</a> and <a href=""http://commons.apache.org/collections/api-3.1/org/apache/commons/collections/map/LinkedMap.html"" rel=""nofollow"">LinkedMap</a> (Java), <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.collections.specialized.ordereddictionary.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">OrderedDictionary</a> (.NET), <a href=""http://codeendeavor.com/gsdocs/net/guttershark/util/collections/OrderedDictionary.html"" rel=""nofollow"">OrderedDictionary</a> (Flash), <a href=""http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0372/"" rel=""nofollow"">OrderedDict</a> (Python), and <a href=""http://cocoawithlove.com/2008/12/ordereddictionary-subclassing-cocoa.html"" rel=""nofollow"">OrderedDictionary</a> (Objective-C). Some of these are more mature, some are more proof-of-concept.</p>

<p><strong>LinkedHashMap</strong> is named according to implementation in the tradition of Java collections — ""linked"" because it uses a doubly-linked list to track insertion order, and ""hash"" because it subclasses HashMap. Besides the fact that user shouldn't need to worry about that, the class name doesn't really even indicate what it does. Using <strong>ordered</strong> seems like the consensus among existing code, but web searches on this topic also revealed understandable confusion between ""ordered"" and ""sorted"", and I feel the same. The .NET implementation even has a comment about the apparent misnomer, and suggests that it should be ""IndexedDictionary"" instead, owing to the fact that you can retrieve and insert objects at a specific point in the ordering.</p>

<p>","115730","","<p>I vote OrderedDictionary, for the following reasons:</p>

<p>""Indexed"" is never used in Cocoa classes, except in one instance.  It always appears as a noun (NSIndexSet, NSIndexPath, objectAtIndex:, etc).  There is only one instance when ""Index"" appears as a verb, which is on NSPropertyDescription's ""indexed"" property: isIndexed and setIndexed.  NSPropertyDescription is roughly analogous to a table column in a database, where ""indexing"" refers to optimizing to speed up search times.  It would therefore make sense that with NSPropertyDescription being part of the Core Data framework, that ""isIndexed"" and ""setIndexed"" would be equivalent to an index in a SQL database.  Therefore, to call it ""IndexedDictionary"" would seem redundant, since indices in databases are created to speed up lookup time, but a dictionary <em>already</em> has O(1) lookup time.  However, to call it ""IndexDictionary"" would also be a misnomer, since an ""index"" in Cocoa refers to position, not order.  The two are semantically different.</p>

<p>I understand your concern over ""OrderedDictionary"", but the precedent has already been set in Cocoa.  When users want to maintain a specific sequence, they use ""ordered"": -[NSApplication orderedDocuments], -[NSWindow orderedIndex], -[NSApplication orderedWindows], etc.  So, John Pirie has mostly the right idea.</p>

<p>However, you don't want to make insertion into the dictionary a burden on your users.  They'll want to create a dictionary <em>once</em> and then have it maintain an appropriate order.  They won't even want to request objects in a specific order.  Order specification should be done during initialization.</p>

<p>Therefore, I recommend making OrderedDictonary a class cluster, with private subclasses of InsertionOrderDictionary and NaturalOrderDictionary and CustomOrderDictionary.  Then, the user simply creates an OrderedDictionary like so:</p>

<pre><code>OrderedDictionary * dict = [[OrderedDictionary alloc] initWithOrder:kInsertionOrder];
//or kNaturalOrder, etc
</code></pre>

<p>For a CustomOrderDictionary, you could have them give you a comparison selector, or even (if they're running 10.6) a block.  I think this would provide the most flexibility for future expansion while still maintain an appropriate name.</p>

","115730","","<p>I think you'll have to post the notifications yourself, unless you use something like CoreData.

","115730","","<p>@toastie had a really good answer.  Mine is similar, but requires a bit more explanation.</p>

<p>Let's say you've already got a controller object and you don't want to instantiate a new controller object just to get at a view, and let's say that you're going to need multiple copies of this view (for example, you've designed a custom UITableViewCell in IB and you want to instantiate it again and again from your UITableViewController).  Here's how you would do that:</p>

<ol>
<li>Add a new IBOutlet to your existing class called ""specialView"" (or something like that).  It may also be helpful to declare it as a (nonatomic, retain) property.</li>
<li>Create a new view xib called ""SpecialView"", and build the view however you like.</li>
<li>Set the File's Owner of the view to be your controller object.</li>
<li>Set the specialView outlet of File's Owner to be the new view.</li>
<li>Whenever you need a new copy of the view in your code, you can simply do the following.</li>
</ol>

<p>(gratuitous text to get formatting working properly)</p>

<pre><code>NSNib * viewNib = [[NSNib alloc] initWithNibNamed:@""SpecialView"" bundle:nil];
[viewNib instantiateNibWithOwner:self topLevelObjects:nil];
[viewNib release];
NSView * myInstantiatedSpecialView = [[[self specialView] retain] autorelease];
[self setSpecialView:nil];
</code></pre>

<p>Yes, it's a bit more code than other ways, but I prefer this method simply because the view shows up in the designated IBOutlet.  I retain and autorelease the view, because I like to reset the outlet to nil once I have the view, so it can be immediately ready to load a new copy of the view.  I'll also point out that the code for this is even shorter on the iPhone, which requires one line to load the view, and not 3 (as it does on the Mac).  That line is simply:</p>

<pre><code>[[NSBundle mainBundle] loadNibNamed:@""SpecialView"" owner:self options:nil];

<p>If, for some reason, you need to have ""empty"" values in an array, then you should insert [NSNull null] instead and test for that.  From the docs: ""The NSNull class defines a singleton object used to represent null values in collection objects (which don’t allow nil values).""</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>This means you could change your code very simply to this:</p>

<pre><code>if ([[arrAllBlocks objectAtIndex:iLine] isEqual:[NSNull null]]) {
  [(NSMutableArray *)arrAllBlocks insertObject:[NSMutableArray array] atIndex:iLine];
}
NSMutableArray *columnArray = (NSMutableArray *)[arrAllBlocks objectAtIndex:iLine];

"<p>Recently I've been trying to save on render time by minimizing the amount of time spent on allocation and duplication of resources as images by using an already allocated UIImageViews and UIImages.</p>

<p>What I try to do is maintain a map of all UIImages - each one unique, and reassign each one to to several UIImageViews, by demand from the game engine.
As the game progresses I remove some UIImageViews from display, and later might reuse them with different preloaded UIImages.</p>

  <p>[m_ImageView setImage otherSavedImg];</p>

","115730","","<p>The docs for UIImageView say ""This method adjusts the frame of the receiver to match the size of the specified image.""  When calling ""setImage:"", your using a simple property setter.  No extra recalculation is done.  If you need to readjust the size of the UIImageView's frame, you'll have to do so manually.</p>

<p>Judging from the context you gave, this seems like it'll be something you'll be doing somewhat frequently.  As such, I recommend creating a category for UIImageView:</p>

<p>UIImageView+Resizing.h:</p>

<pre><code>@interface UIImageView (Resizing)

  [self setImage:newImage];
  if (shouldResize == YES) {
    [self sizeToFit];
  }
}

@end

<p>Now, whenever you need to change an image and resize the imageView, simply #import UIImageView+Resizing.h and use:</p>

<pre><code>[myImageView setImage:anImage resize:YES];

","115730","","<p>I'm not sure I understand what you're asking for.  Isn't it pretty trivial to figure out how many NSTextFields the user wants and then have a little for() loop to create them?  You'll probably want to keep track of the textfields, so I would probably do it like this:</p>

<pre><code>NSMutableDictionary * interfaceElements = [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] init];

for (NSInteger i = 0; i &lt; numberOfTextFields; ++i) {

  //and has 10px between it and the previous NSTextField (or window edge)
  NSRect frame = NSMakeRect(10, (i*22 + (i+1)*10), 100, 22);
  NSTextField * newField = [[NSTextField alloc] initWithFrame:frame];
  //configure newField appropriately
  [[myWindow contentView] addSubview:newField];
  [interfaceElements setObject:newField forKey:@""someUniqueIdentifier""];

"<p>Today I am looking into how to make a simple XML parser in Cocoa (for the desktop).  I am thinking of using NSXMLParser to parse the data, but am not quite sure where to start.  The XML file on the web doesn't have the much data in it, just a simple listing with a few things that I need to save into a variable.  Does anyone have any suggestions on how to do this, as the online documentation about this isn't making too much sense.</p>

<p>Thanks for any help!</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> The reason why I am wanting to create an XML parser is to get information from a MYSQL database on a server to the client application.  If there is some better way to do this besides a XML parser, please let me know!</p>
","115730","","<p>Here's how it works:</p>

<p>There's a class called NSXMLParser.  It's used to parse XML files.  However, NSXMLParser is stupid.  All it knows how to do is parse XML, but it doesn't know what it's supposed to do with the information it finds.</p>

<p>Enter a delegate.  A delegate is like a nanny.  Since the XMLParser doesn't have a clue what to do with the information it finds, it goes and asks its delegate about each and every thing:  ""Hey!  I started parsing a document! Am I supposed to do anything?"" ""Hey!  I found some CDATA! What am I supposed to do with it!""  ""Hey! I found another tag!"" ""Hey! I found a closing tag!"", and so on.  All of these ""Hey!"" statements are delegate methods, or in other words, they are optional methods that a delegate object may choose to implement.  Usually (but not always), the object that creates the NSXMLParser is also the delegate, but that doesn't have to be the case.</p>

<p>So you might have something like this:</p>

<pre><code>NSXMLParser * parser = [[NSXMLParser alloc] initWithContentsOfURL:someURLToAnXMLFile];
[parser setDelegate:self];
[parser parse];
[parser release];
</code></pre>

<p>Then in that same object (self), you might have some of these methods:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)parserDidStartDocument:(NSXMLParser *)parser {
  //the parser started this document. what are you going to do?
}

- (void)parser:(NSXMLParser *)parser didStartElement:(NSString *)elementName namespaceURI:(NSString *)namespaceURI qualifiedName:(NSString *)qualifiedName attributes:(NSDictionary *)attributeDict {
  //the parser found an XML tag and is giving you some information about it
  //what are you going to do?
}

- (void)parser:(NSXMLParser *)parser foundCharacters:(NSString *)string {
  //the parser found some characters inbetween an opening and closing tag
  //what are you going to do?
}

- (void)parserDidEndDocument:(NSXMLParser *)parser {
  //the parser finished. what are you going to do?
}
</code></pre>

<p>There are a whole bunch of these methods listed in the documentation.  Simply go to the NSXMLParser class reference, and they're all listed under the ""Delegate Methods"" section.  Once you get the hang of it, NSXMLParser is pretty easy to use.  It is a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple%5FAPI%5Ffor%5FXML"">SAX Parser</a>, which means it's event-driven parser.  It finds stuff, and it tells you about it.</p>

"<p>Does the addSubview method actually load the view into the application or not? The reason I am asking is because I have two two views in my application. The application delegate adds the two views as subviews and then brings one of the views up front. Now, I have a print statement in each of the viewDidLoad methods for each view. When I run the application, the application delegate loads the views as subViews and as each view is loaded, I actually see the console print out the statements that I placed in each of the viewDidLoad methods. Is this supposed to be doing this?</p>
","115730","","<p>viewDidLoad is actually a method of UIViewController, not UIView.  It gets called after the view gets loaded into memory (after your init method, but before the awakeFromNib).  You'll notice that addSubview: takes a UIView as a parameter, so the view must have been loaded in order for the view to be added to another view.  Otherwise you'd be trying to add an imaginary view.</p>

<p>In answer to your question, yes it is supposed to be doing this.  viewDidLoad is called long before you addSubview.  In fact, if you take out the addSubview: lines, you'll notice that it's still getting called (because you're creating the view's controller).</p>

     return initial;<br>
}</pre></li>
<li><p>In your fetch request, request ONLY this PropertyDescription, like so (this is another quarter of the magic):</p>

<pre>NSDictionary * entityProperties = [myEntityDescription propertiesByName];<br>
NSPropertyDescription * lastNameInitialProperty = [entityProperties objectForKey:@""lastNameInitial""];<br>
[fetchRequest setPropertiesToFetch:[NSArray arrayWithObject:lastNameInitialProperty]];</pre></li>
<li><p>Make sure your fetch request ONLY returns distinct results (this is the last quarter of the magic):</p>

<pre>[fetchRequest setReturnsDistinctResults:YES];</pre></li>
<li><p>Order your results by this letter:<br></p>

<pre>NSSortDescriptor * lastNameInitialSortOrder = [[[NSSortDescriptor alloc] initWithKey:@""lastNameInitial"" ascending:YES] autorelease];<br>

<li><p>execute the request, and see what it gives you.</p></li>

<p>Also, with respect to these getter methods, they should not return objects with a +1 retain count (which is what you have going).  If anything, they should return the object directly or return it with a +0 retain count (retain/copy + autorelease).  It <em>greatly</em> simplifies your memory management to do it that way.

"<p>I have been looking through the questions asked on StackOverflow, but there are so many about memory management in Objective-C that I couldn't find the answer I was looking for.</p>

<p>The question is if it is ok (and recommnded) to call autorelease before adding a newly created object to a collection (like NSMutableArray)? Or should I release it explicitly after adding it. (I know NSMutableArray willl retain the object)</p>

<p>This illustrates my question:</p>

<p><strong><em>Scenario A (autorelease):</em></strong></p>

   // array is an instance of NSMutableArray

<p>Can the Objective-C gurus shed some light on this?</p>
","115730","","<p>Both are correct and will work as you're expecting them to.</p>

<p>I personally prefer to use the latter method, but only because I like to be explicit about when objects get released.  By autoreleasing the object, all we're doing is saying ""this object will get released at some arbitrary point in the future.""  That means you can put the autoreleased object into the array, destroy the array, and the object might (probably) still exist.</p>

<p>With the latter method, the object would get destroyed immediately with the array (providing that nothing else has come along and retained it in the meantime).  If I'm in a memory-constrained environment (say, the iPhone) where I need to be careful about how much memory I'm using, I'll use the latter method just so I don't have so many objects lingering in an NSAutoreleasePool somewhere.  If memory usage isn't a big concern for you (and it usually isn't for me, either), then either method is totally acceptable.</p>

","115730","","<p>You're misunderstanding how the cellForRowAtIndexPath: method works.</p>

<p>The way you have it, you're creating a single cell, and then repeatedly resetting its text, textColor, and font properties, then returning a single cell.</p>

<p>The key to understanding your issue is understanding that cellForRowAtIndexPath: is called <em>multiple times</em>, once for each cell that will be displayed on the screen.  So instead of your for() loop, do this:</p>

<pre><code>NSDictionary * story = [stories objectAtIndex:[indexPath row]];
[cell setTextColor:[UIColor whiteColor]];
[cell setFont: [UIFont systemFontOfSize:11]];
cell.text = [NSString stringWithFormat:[story objectForKey:@""message""]];

<p>The indexPath parameter being passed in is how the tableView indicates which cell it's asking you for.  We use that to grab the corresponding story dictionary from your array.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>I'd also like to point out that this code is not iPhone OS 3.0 compatible.  The 3.0 SDK introduced changes into how UITableViewCell works, including its view hierarchy.  You probably want to be accessing the textLabel of the cell, and then setting the properties of <em>that</em>, like this:</p>

<p>I'm guessing the IOKit lib isn't linked correctly (if I interpret the arcane musings of g++ correctly...), but I have no idea how to actually link it?</p>

<p>Any help appreciated - also any links to nice tutorials on creating your own Objective C apps.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>
","115730","","<p>I believe you're correct in thinking that the IOKit framework isn't linked correctly.  Here's how you can make sure:</p>

<ul>
<li>Expand the ""Targets"" group in your groups and files tree and double click on the target that needs the IOKit. (Or right click and choose Get Info)  The target's info panel will come up.</li>
<li>The first tab of the info panel is where we need to be.  The bottom half of the tab is a list of Linked Libraries.  The IOKit is probably not in that list, so click the plus button in the bottom left.</li>
<li>Scroll down a little bit until you see IOKit.framework.  Select that, and click ""Add"".  This will add the IOKit to your framework and link it into the target.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you've already added the IOKit framework to your project, then you just need to verify that it's part of the ""Link Binary with Libraries"" phase of the appropriate target.  (Targets group > expand your target > Link Binary with Libraries).  If it's not there but it's in your project, then you can either follow the steps above or simply drag and drop the framework from wherever it is in your groups and files tree.</p>

"<p>I am fairly new to Objective-C and was wondering what the best way to manage collections of tuples was. In C I would use a 2D array or a struct.</p>

<p>Should I be creating objects to contain these tuples? It seems like overkill for just sorting lists or is there no real extra load generated by object initialisation?</p>
","115730","","<p>There are a couple different ways you could go about this:</p>

<ol>
<li>CoreData.  While it's not technically a database, it can behave a lot like one.  If you don't need persistence between app runs, then consider using the NSInMemoryStoreType store type, as opposed to an NSSQLiteStoreType or other option.  However, if you're going to want to join tuples together, using CoreData <em>will absolutely not work</em> (this, IMO, is the main reason why CoreData is <em>not</em> a database).</li>
<li>Use a real database.  SQLite ships on every Mac and iPhone and is pretty easy to use if you use wrappers like <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/flycode/"" rel=""nofollow"">FMDB</a> or <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/sqlitepersistentobjects/"" rel=""nofollow"">SQLite Persistent Objects</a> or <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/pldatabase/"" rel=""nofollow"">PLDatabase</a> or <a href=""http://github.com/enormego/egodatabase/tree/master"" rel=""nofollow"">EGODatabase</a> or the <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/google-toolbox-for-mac/"" rel=""nofollow"">GTMSQLite wrapper by Google</a>.</li>
<li>A tuple is really just a collection of key-value pairs, so you could just use an NSMutableArray of NSMutableDictionaries.  You obviously won't get to use SQL syntax, and any joins/queries you have to run yourself, but this would definitely have the easiest setup.</li>
<li>Write a tuple class and store those in an NSMutableArray (similar to #3, just enforcing a common set of attributes on your tuples).</li>
</ol>

"<p>OK So here's the plan. The XML I'm getting data from allows non-numeric text in phone number fields (for descriptions or contact names, etc). I am trying to extract only the numbers and call the tel: URL with them to initiate a call. Here's whats NOT working:</p>

NSString *strippedNumber = [number stringByTrimmingCharactersInSet:charset];
NSString *phoneURL = [NSString stringWithFormat:@""tel:%@"", strippedNumber];
[[UIApplication sharedApplication] openURL:[NSURL URLWithString:phoneURL]];
</code></pre>

<p>if there are any obvious typos, they're just typos. :)</p>
","115730","","<p>You're using a trim method, which means that it's only looking at the outer edges of the string.  You're probably getting something like:  ""555) 555-555"" as the phone number, correct?</p>

<p>I'm not aware of an NS(Mutable)String method along the lines of ""replaceOccurrencesOfCharactersInSet:(NSCharacterSet *)set"", and I admit, that'd probably be really nice to have.</p>

<p>Being me, I'd probably just use a regex.  If you use <a href=""http://regexkit.sourceforge.net"">RegexKitLite</a>, then you can easily do:</p>

<pre><code>#import ""RegexKitLite.h""

NSString * number = @""(555) 555-555 Office"";
NSString * strippedNumber = [number stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfRegex:@""[^0-9]"" withString:@""""];

<p>It might be a bit overkill, but it will do exactly what you're looking for.</p>

<p>FYI: ""[^0-9]"" means ""any character that's not 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9"".</p>

"<p><strong>What I want to do</strong></p>

<p>I have a circular custom NSView subclass, and I want to change the appearance of the cursor when the mouse is hovering over the circular portions of the view, but not when over the portions of the view's rectangle that fall outside the circle.</p>

<p><a href=""http://ryanballantyne.name/forumstuff/CursorPict.png"" rel=""nofollow"">Here's an illustration</a>. I would have inlined it with an image tag, but I'm too new to partake of such awesome features.</p>

<p><strong>What I know so far</strong></p>

<p>I know how to change the appearance of the cursor through NSCursor. I think that the best way to accomplish this for a rectangular view would be with a cursor rectangle. I know that I could receive mouseMoved events (and ought to turn them off when the mouse isn't over this view, using mouseEntered and mouseExited), and have a simple, inexpensive way to determine if a point lies in the region of interest.</p>

<p><strong>So what's the problem then?</strong></p>

<p>As far as I can tell, the system does not send mouseMoved events to a view that is not the first responder. Therefore, if I want to get mouseMoved events when the mouse is hovering over my view, I need to steal firstResponder status from whoever currently has it. If a text view has the focus, simply moving the mouse over such a view would steal it away, which is simply unacceptable from a usability standpoint.</p>

<p>Therefore, my question boils down to: is there a better way to do this? Can I get mouseMoved events without being the first responder?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>I would have added the following tags: custom-views mouse-events NSCursor firstResponder
But again, I'm an SA noob so I can't.</p>
","115730","","<p>I think you may just need to override the acceptsFirstResponder method in your NSView to return YES. If you don't, then the view won't receive any event information. </p>

The second parameter indicates what kind of application you're looking for, ie an app that can edit this file, or an app that can view this file, etc.  kLSRolesAll means you don't care.

","115730","","<p>A philosophical answer about alloc/init.</p>

<p>init is not a constructor.  Conceptually, ""construction"" does not exist in Objective-C.  In Java (and other languages with constructors), calling the constructor will return a new instantiation of the object that is ready to go.  <em>There is no exact equivalent to this in Objective-C</em>.  (One could argue that convenience class methods such as +array, +arrayWithObjects, etc are technically constructors since they wrap both allocation and initialization, but I would argue that they're still not constructors in the same sense as Java constructors.)</p>

<p>What we have instead is the concept of allocation and initialization, two distinct steps that, when executed together, act as if they were a ""constructor"".  The class method +alloc simply requests an appropriately sized chunk of memory from the system.  IIRC, it uses the calloc() function to do so.  It is not guaranteed that any zeroing will take place during the execution of the alloc function.  This means that we need to do the initialization ourselves, which we do by <em>immediately</em> calling an -init method.</p>

<p>HOWEVER, -init (and all derivatives) are nothing more than ordinary instance methods.  You can message them whenever you want in order to ""reset"" an object instance to its original initialized state (although there are some memory management ramifications of doing this that must be taken into account).  It also means that you can do something ridiculous like this:</p>

<pre><code>NSUInteger count = [[[NSArray alloc] autorelease] count];
</code></pre>

<p>I can't think of a good reason why you'd want to do this, but the point is that <em>you can</em>.  It further goes to emphasize that <em>init is not a constructor</em>.  In the example above, the object exists by the time the +alloc method returns.  However, it may not be properly initialized, which means that the unsigned integer ""count"" might not be zero.  It could be, but it would be incorrect to rely on that behavior (unless otherwise documented, of course).</p>

<p>One of the advantages of breaking construction into allocation and initialization is we can have a large degree of control over exactly what's getting initialized.  In Java, for example, you can only have one constructor per method signature.  In other words, if you have a constructor that takes a single ""Object"" argument, then that's the only constructor that can.  You cannot create another constructor that also takes a single Object argument.</p>

<p>In Objective-C, parameter types are not part of the method signature (known as a ""selector""), and so I can create  an initializer like so:</p>

<pre><code>- (id) initWithAnObject:(id)anObject;
</code></pre>

<p>However, I can also create another initializer:</p>

<pre><code>- (id) initWithADifferentObject:(id)anObject;
</code></pre>

<p>I can set these up to do totally different initializations of the object on which they're invoked.  This is unbelievably useful!</p>

<p>Another really useful aspect of splitting construction into allocation and initialization is that you can chain initializers.  AFAIK, you can't call constructors from within constructors in languages like Java (well, you <em>can</em>, but it doesn't have the same effect).  In Objective-C, however, you can do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>- (id) initWithCapacity:(NSUInteger)initialCapacity {
  if (self = [super init]) {
    [self setInitialCapacity:initialCapacity];
  }
  return self;
}

- (id) init {
  return [self initWithCapacity:0];
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now when you alloc/init an object set up like this, it will ""redirect"" and use the initWithCapacity initializer, even though you called init.  (This is how NSArray's init method works)  This means you can use conditional initializers.  For example, have your -init method dispatch to one initializer under certain conditions but use a different one under different conditions.</p>

<p>In summary, the Objective-C model of ""allocate and initialize"" is much more powerful than the idea of construction.  You, as the programmer, have a much greater degree of control over the initial setup phase of your object.  It is a really liberating shift.</p>

<p>ps - <em>init is not a constructor!</em> ;)</p>

"<p>Hey all, trying to learn objective-c. It was going quite well, until I realized I was missing a link.</p>

","115730","","<p>MVC in Cocoa is slightly different than traditional MVC, so I'll answer with the Cocoa way.</p>

<p>You've got a controller object, which has a pointer to your Polygon object.  Your controller should also have a pointer to your View (via an IBOutlet, most likely).  As the polygon changes (whether numberOfSides or whatever), the controller needs to be aware of that and relay the information on to the view.  Likewise, if the view is allowed to change the numberOfSides (say you have a slider to increase the number of sides), then the controller needs to be aware of that change and pass it to the Polygon object.</p>

<p>Basically, the purpose of the controller is to pass information back and forth from the view to the model and make sure that they stay synchronized.</p>

<p>I know that's a rather vague question, so let me give you an example.</p>

<p>I have an application I'm currently working on that iterates through all of a user's contact book on the iPhone. From there, I wrote a model class called 'Person'. I used to do something like this in a loop of people:</p>

<p>Person *person = [[Person alloc] initWithWrapper:mywrapper];</p>

<p>mywrapper would contain an NSDictionary with the attributes for person. Later I'd be able to populate the address book in my app with the person objects.</p>

<p>Now I've started rebuilding parts of the app with Core Data. Do I continue using the strategy above to populate my address book? Or do I do something like this instead:</p>

<pre><code>	Person *person = (Person *)[NSEntityDescription insertNewObjectForEntityForName:@""Person"" inManagedObjectContext:managedObjectContext];

	[person setName:name];
	[person setDob:dob];

	// Commit the change.
	NSError *error;
	if (![managedObjectContext save:&amp;error]) {
		// Handle the error.
	}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is, this code gets executed everytime the app gets started. Should I not be using core data as it will populate the storage mechanism with redundant instances of person everytime the app loads? Should I modify my NSManagedObject (Person class) and add my initWithWrapper: method and continue as I normally would there? </p>

<p>Slightly confused, would love clarification.</p>
","115730","","<p>Yeah, it's simplest to add the initWithWrapper method to your Person class.  It would be something like this:</p>

  if (self = [super initWithEntity:person insertIntoManagedObjectContext:someMOC]) {
    //do your wrapperly initialization here
  }
  return self;
}
</code></pre>

"<p>how can i declare a global NSArray and then use it across my app?</p>
","115730","","<p>There are a couple different ways you can do this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Instead of declaring it as a global variable, wrap it in a singleton object, then have the singleton by available anywhere (by #importing the .h file)</p></li>
<li><p>Create a .h file, like ""Globals.h"".  In the .h, declare your array as <code>extern NSMutableArray * myGlobalArray;</code>  Then in the somewhere else in your app (the AppDelegate is a good place), just do: <code>myGlobalArray = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init];</code>  Then anywhere you need the array, just <code>#import ""Globals.h""</code></p></li>
<li><p>This is like #2, but without the global header.  You can define your array as <code>extern NSMutableArray *myGlobalArray;</code> inside the <code>#ifdef __OBJC__</code> block of your project's .pch file.  The .pch file is a header file that is automatically #imported into every file in your project.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>There are pros and cons of each approach.  I've used all three at varying times in varying circumstances. I would say the singleton approach is probably the most proper, since it would be most flexible for initialization, access restriction, and memory management.  However, it can be unnecessary if you don't need that.</p>

<p>Option #2 is nice if you have lots of ""global"" variables that you don't want to expose to every file across your project.  You can just #import it where its needed.  However, this approach (as well as #3) disassociates the declaration from the initialization (ie, the object is not created near where it's declared). Some might argue this is not proper, and they might be correct.</p>

<p>Option #3 is nice because then you never have to remember to #import anything at all.  However, it raises the same questions as option #2.</p>

I've seen various <a href=""http://iphonedevelopment.blogspot.com/2009/08/dot-notation-controversy.html"">back</a> and <a href=""http://weblog.bignerdranch.com/?p=83"">forths</a> about the merits of dot notation vs. message notation.  To keep the responses untainted I'm not going to respond either way in the question.</p>

<p>What is your thought about dot notation vs. message notation for property accessing?  </p>

<p>Please try to keep it focused on Objective-C - my one bias I'll put forth is that Objective-C is Objective-C, so your preference that it be like Java or JavaScript aren't valid.</p>

<p>Valid commentary is to do with technical issues (operation ordering, cast precedence, performance, etc), clarity (structure vs. object nature, both pro and con!), succinctness, etc.</p>

<p>Note, I'm of the school of rigorous quality and readability in code having worked on huge projects where code convention and quality is paramount (the write once read a thousand times paradigm).</p>
","115730","","<p>Let me start off by saying that I started programming in Visual/Real Basic, then moved on to Java, so I'm fairly used to dot syntax.  However, when I finally moved to Objective-C and got used to brackets, then saw the introduction of Objective-C 2.0 and its dot syntax, I realized that I really don't like it. (for other languages it's fine, because that's how they roll).</p>

<p>I have three main beefs with dot syntax in Objective-C:</p>

<p><strong>Beef #1:</strong> It makes it unclear why you might be getting errors.  For example, if I have the line:</p>

<p><code>something.frame.origin.x = 42;</code></p>

<p>Then I'll get a compiler error, because <code>something</code> is an object, and you can't use structs of an object as the lvalue of an expression.  However, if I have:</p>

<p><code>something.frame.origin.x = 42;</code></p>

<p>Then this compiles just fine, because <code>something</code> is a struct itself that has an NSRect member, and I <em>can</em> use it as an lvalue.</p>

<p>If I were adopting this code, I would need to spend some time trying to figure out what <code>something</code> is.  Is it a struct?  Is it an object?  However, when we use the bracket syntax, it's much clearer:</p>

<p><code>[something setFrame:newFrame];</code></p>

<p>In this case, there is absolutely no ambiguity if <code>something</code> is an object or not.  The introduction of ambiguity is my beef #1.</p>

<p><strong>Beef #2:</strong> In C, dot syntax is used to access members of structs, not call methods.  Programmers can override the <code>setFoo:</code> and <code>foo</code> methods of an objects, yet still access them via <code>something.foo</code>.  In my mind, when I see expressions using dot syntax, I'm expecting them to be a simple assignation into an ivar.  <em>This is not always the case.</em>  Consider a controller object that mediates an array and a tableview.  If I call <code>myController.contentArray = newArray;</code>, I would expect it to be replacing the old array with the new array.  However, the original programmer might have overridden <code>setContentArray:</code> to not only set the array, but also reload the tableview.  From the line, there's no indication of that behavior.  If I were to see <code>[myController setContentArray:newArray];</code>, then I would think ""Aha, a method.  I need to go see the definition of this method just to make sure I know what it's doing.""</p>

<p>So I think my summary of Beef #2 is that you can override the meaning of dot syntax with custom code.</p>

<p><strong>Beef #3:</strong> I think it looks bad.  As an Objective-C programmer, I'm totally used to bracket syntax, so to be reading along and see lines and lines of beautiful brackets and then to be suddenly broken with <code>foo.name = newName; foo.size = newSize;</code> etc is a bit distracting to me.  I realize that some things require dot syntax (C structs), but that's the only time I use them.</p>

<p>Of course, if you're writing code for yourself, then use whatever you're comfortable with.  But if you're writing code that you're planning on open sourcing, or you're writing something you don't expect to maintain forever, then I would strong encourage using bracket syntax.  This is, of course, just my opinion.</p>

"<p>I've been trying out some of the view code from Erica Sadun's book ""The iPhone Developer's Cookbook"" and found some code I don't understand. Here's the code for a loadView method:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)loadView
{
	// Create the main view
	UIView *contentView = [[UIView alloc] initWithFrame: 
		[[UIScreen mainScreen] applicationFrame]];
	contentView.backgroundColor = [UIColor whiteColor];
	self.view = contentView;
   [contentView release];

	// Get the view bounds as our starting point
	CGRect apprect = [contentView bounds];

	// Add each inset subview
	UIView *subview = [[UIView alloc] 
		initWithFrame:CGRectInset(apprect, 32.0f, 32.0f)];
	subview.backgroundColor = [UIColor lightGrayColor];
	[contentView addSubview:subview];
	[subview release];
}
</code></pre>

<p>My question is why does she release contentView, but then use it again in <code>[contentView addSubview:subview]</code>? Has <code>self.view = contentView</code> retained contentView?</p>
","115730","","<p>If you look in the documentation for UIViewController, you'll see that the view property is declared as:</p>

<p><code>@property(nonatomic, retain) UIView *view;</code></p>

<p>This means that when you use the setView: method (or use .view on the left hand side of the =), then whatever value you pass in will be retained.  So, if you go through the code and look at retain counts, you'll get this:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)loadView {
    // Create the main view
    UIView *contentView = [[UIView alloc] initWithFrame: 
            [[UIScreen mainScreen] applicationFrame]];  //retain count +1
    contentView.backgroundColor = [UIColor whiteColor];  //retain count +1
    self.view = contentView;  //retain count +2
    [contentView release];  //retain count +1

    // Get the view bounds as our starting point
    CGRect apprect = [contentView bounds];

    // Add each inset subview
    UIView *subview = [[UIView alloc] 
            initWithFrame:CGRectInset(apprect, 32.0f, 32.0f)];
    subview.backgroundColor = [UIColor lightGrayColor];
    [contentView addSubview:subview];
    [subview release];
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>I'd say that the really interesting thing is that after releasing contentView, we can still send messages to it, because the object living at the end of contentView's pointer still exists (since it was retained by calling setView:).</p>

"<p>I want to build a Cocoa App with a list of entries very similar to the ToDo list of Things.app (<a href=""http://culturedcode.com/things/screencast.html"">see the screencast</a>). The question is whether I should use </p>

<ol>
<li>a TableView,</li>
<li>a CollectionView or</li>
<li>a WebView.</li>
</ol>

<p>I think it could work with all of them, but which one suits the following requirements best?</p>

<ul>
<li>have a list of entries -> 1 column &amp; many rows</li>
<li>reordering with drag &amp; drop</li>
<li>select single entries &amp; use keys for actions like delete</li>
<li>open up an entry: the row should expand to show more input fields</li>
<li>customized look: rounded corners, shadow, background gradient</li>
</ul>

<p>So far my research says that the TableView has most of the functionality, but is harder to customize in its appearance, the CollectionView doesn't have drag &amp; drop (right?) but is easy to design and the WebView would take much effort to not hurt the user experience and I can't bind my model directly to input fields.</p>

<p>What pros and cons am I missing and what would you recommend to use?</p>

<p>Is there any way to intercept the touch events getting sent to the button? What I'd like to eventually do is make a UIView subclass that will tell its view controller (or delegate, whichever) when it detects a swipe so it can ""push"" the next view controller onto the stack (similar to the iPhone home screen). I figured this was the first step, but I'm open to suggestions if I'm approaching this incorrectly.</p>
","115730","","<p>Instinct would say ""subclass UIButton"", but UIButton is actually a class cluster (ie, the actual type of object transparently changes depending on what kind of button you want to make), which makes it supremely difficult to subclass.  Short of rewriting UIButton, there's not much you can do on that approach.</p>

<p>When I needed to solve an almost identical problem, I came up with a view that uses composition to display a proxy UIView, but still allow for touch interception.  Here's how it works:</p>

<pre><code>@interface MyView : UIView {
  UIView * visibleView;
}

- (id) initWithFrame:(CGRect)frame controlClass:(Class)class;

@implementation MyView

- (id) initWithFrame:(CGRect)frame controlClass:(Class)class {
  if (self = [super initWithFrame:frame]) {
    CGRect visibleViewFrame = frame;
    visibleViewFrame.origin = CGPointZero;
    visibleView = [[class alloc] initWithFrame:visibleViewFrame];
    [visibleView setUserInteractionEnabled:NO];
    [self addSubview:visibleView];

    [self setUserInteractionEnabled:YES];
    [self setBackgroundColor:[UIColor clearColor]];
  }
  return self;
}

- (void) dealloc {
  [visibleView removeFromSuperview];
  [visibleView release], visibleView = nil;
  [super dealloc];
}

- (void) touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event {
  if (someCondition == YES) {
    [visibleView touchesBegan:touches withEvent:event];
  }
}

//and similar methods for touchesMoved:, touchesEnded:, etc

@end
</code></pre>

<p>The basic idea to this is that you're embedding the button (or whatever) into a container class (similar to what you described in your question).  However, you're disabling interaction on the button, which means that when a user taps the button, the tap event will ""fall through"" the button and into the buttons containing superview (in this, your MyView instance).  From there, you can process the touch appropriately.  If you want the button to ""respond"" to the touch, just allow the button to do so by sending the appropriate UIResponder message.  (You <em>might</em> need to re-enable userInteractionEnabled on the visibleView first, though.  I'm unsure of that.)</p>

<p>As I stated above, I have used this approach (not this exact implementation, but this pattern) quite successfully, when I needed to have a button on the interface, but also capture the UITouch object itself.</p>

"<p>Before diving in and rolling my own implementation in Objective-C, I'm looking around to try and find an iPhone SDK-compatible directed graph (""digraph"") implementation.

","115730","","<p>I've never heard of any Cocoa directed graph implementation like what you appear to be describing, but it really shouldn't be too difficult to implement.  Basically you'd just need a Node object with an id ivar to hold the value and an NSMutableSet to point to its children.  Ensuring acyclicality would be about a O(n log n) operation (where n is the # of nodes in the graph).  When you go to add a child to a Node, you'd just need to traverse the children links and make sure that none are ever repeated.  It'd be something like this:</p>

<pre><code>BOOL isNodeAcyclic(Node * n, NSMutableSet * visitedNodes) {
  if ([visitedNodes intersectsSet:[n children]]) { return NO; }

<p>Then to determine if a node you're adding to a graph would make it be cyclical, you'd just need to do something like this in your Node class:</p>

<pre><code>- (BOOL) addChild:(Node *)newChild {
  [[self children] addObject:newChild];
  BOOL isAcyclic = isNodeAcyclic(newChild, [NSMutableSet set]);
  if (isAcyclic == NO) {
    //adding this child has caused a cycle
    [[self children] removeObject:newChild];
  }
  return isAcyclic;
}
</code></pre>

<p>(I just wrote this off the top of my head and haven't tested it.  However, it should work.)</p>

<p>If you come up with an implementation that's appropriate, be sure to talk to <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/users/120292"">Quinn Taylor</a> (the author of CHDataStructures).  This seems like the sort of thing that would be really neat to have in that framework.  OTOH, he might be willing to write it for you and include it in the framework himself.</p>

"<p>How do I validate the string input to a <code>UITextField</code>? I want to check that the string is numeric, including decimal points.</p>
","115730","","<p>There are a few ways you could do this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Use NSNumberFormatter's numberFromString: method.  This will return an NSNumber if it can parse the string correctly, or <code>nil</code> if it cannot.</li>
<li>Use NSScanner</li>
<li>Strip any non-numeric character and see if the string still matches</li>
<li>Use a regular expression</li>
</ol>

<p>IMO, using something like <code>-[NSString doubleValue]</code> wouldn't be the best option because both <code>@""0.0""</code> and <code>@""abc""</code> will have a doubleValue of 0.  The *value methods all return 0 if they're not able to convert the string properly, so it would be difficult to distinguish between a legitimate string of <code>@""0""</code> and a non-valid string.  Something like C's <code>strtol</code> function would have the same issue.</p>

<p>I think using NSNumberFormatter would be the best option, since it takes locale into account (ie, the number <code>@""1,23""</code> in Europe, versus <code>@""1.23""</code> in the USA).</p>

<p>Basically, it stems from the idea that a superclass may have over-ridden the designated initializer to return a different object than the one returned from <code>+alloc</code>.  If you didn't assign the return value of <code>super</code>'s initializer into <code>self</code>, then you could potentially be dealing with a partially initialized object (because the object that <code>super</code> initialized isn't the same object that you're initializing).</p>

same effect, lots and lots of pew pew pew's, way more than 20.</p>

","115730","","<p>First, <code>[[effectsLayer alloc] retain]</code> is terrible.  Never do that.  Ever.  Never use an allocated object that has not been initialized.  Furthermore, this will retain the object <em>at least twice</em>, since a call to +alloc returns a retained object, and you're retaining it again, then adding it to an array (which retains it a third time), but it's only getting released twice (when it's removed from the array and your singular release).</p>

<p>I suspect that the problem is with this line: <code>[self addChild:elayer z:2];</code>  What does this method do?  Is it in charge of actually drawing the elayer onto the screen?  If so, then that means its probably also retaining elayer, which means it's not getting deallocated, because you don't appear to be doing any sort of ""removeChild"" call when popping things out of your mutable array.</p>

<p>In short: just because something's no longer in your array doesn't mean it's also not on the screen.</p>

<p>I am a newbie to Objective-C and try to learn it for iPhone-App-Development. I used the  tutorial linked in the link list to create a standard app with a simple basic Navigation.
This app contains a ""RootView"" that is displayed at startup. The startup screen itself contains three elements wich all link to SubViewOne.
I have got it to work this far.
So what i want to change is to make the second element link to SubViewTwo.</p>

<p>When i ""Build and Go"" it, i get the following errors:</p>

<p>RootViewController.m:</p>

<pre><code>SubViewTwoController *subViewTwoController = [[SubViewTwoController alloc] init];
</code></pre>

<p>//    <em>SubViewTwoController undeclared (first use in this function)</em></p>

<p>and in SubViewTwoController.m</p>

<pre><code>[super didReceiveMemoryWarning]; // Releases the view if it doesn't have a superview
</code></pre>

<p><em>no superclass declared in @interface for ´SubViewTwoController´</em></p>

<p>and the same thing after</p>

<pre><code>- (void)dealloc {
    [super dealloc];
</code></pre>

<p>I think you will also need the header files, so here they are!</p>

<p>RootViewController.h</p>

<pre><code>#import &lt;UIKit/UIKit.h&gt;  

@interface RootViewController : UITableViewController {  
    IBOutlet NSMutableArray *views;  
}  

@property (nonatomic, retain) IBOutlet NSMutableArray *views;  

@end
</code></pre>

<p>SubViewOneController.h</p>

<pre><code>#import &lt;UIKit/UIKit.h&gt;  

@interface SubViewOneController : UIViewController {  
    IBOutlet UILabel *label;  
    IBOutlet UIButton *button;  
}  

@property (retain,nonatomic) IBOutlet UILabel *label;  
@property (retain,nonatomic) IBOutlet UIButton *button;  

- (IBAction) OnButtonClick:(id) sender;  

@end
</code></pre>

<p>and SubViewTwoController.h</p>

<pre><code>#import &lt;UIKit/UIKit.h&gt;


@interface SubViewTwo : UIViewController {
      IBOutlet NSMutableArray *views;  
}

@end
</code></pre>

<p>I would be really great if you would leave your ideas with a short explanation.
Thanks a lot in advance!</p>

<p>benny</p>
","115730","","<p>A couple of things going on here:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>@interface SubViewTwo : UIViewController {</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Your class is called ""SubViewTwo"", not ""SubViewTwoController""</p>

<ol>
<li><em>no superclass declared in @interface for ´SubViewTwoController´</em></li>
</ol>

<p>Your class is called ""SubViewTwo"", not ""SubViewTwoController"".  You've probably got <code>@implementation SubViewTwoController</code> at the top of the file.</p>

<p>The easiest fix would be to change the @interface line in SubViewTwoController.h to read:</p>

<p><code>@interface SubViewTwoController : UIViewController {</code></p>

<p>Then don't forget to <code>#import ""SubViewTwoController.h</code> in your <code>RootViewController.m</code> file.</p>

"<p>I have to NSTableViews in my application both display the data which is being stored as ""CoreData"". 
The TableViews are pretty basic, as the whole programm is. </p>

<p>The right TableView shows a list of checklists, the left shows the contents of this checklist. 
Now I want to allow a user to drag an item which is inside a checklist to another checklist. </p>

<p>I found several tutorials and sample code on the web, but they are way to overwhelming for my understanding of Cocoa. It would be great if someone could mention a webpage or tutorial or the like with short and easy to understand instructions. </p>

<p>Thanks a lot</p>

<p>EDIT:
Although it should be obvious, my application is written in Cocoa and runs on the Mac.</p>
","115730","","<p>I've got a little demo on how to use NSOutlineView with drag and drop on my downloads page:  <a href=""http://davedelong.com/downloads"">http://davedelong.com/downloads</a>  It should be pretty applicable to NSTableView, since NSOutlineView is a subclass of NSTableView.</p>

<p>Here is a 5 minute distillation of what I've learned after about a month of reading documentation.  There are three ""basic"" NSTableView delegate methods used when dragging and dropping stuff from NSTableViews.  They are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><code>- (BOOL)tableView:(NSTableView *)aTableView acceptDrop:(id &lt;NSDraggingInfo&gt;)info row:(NSInteger)row dropOperation:(NSTableViewDropOperation)operation;</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>- (NSDragOperation)tableView:(NSTableView *)aTableView validateDrop:(id &lt; NSDraggingInfo &gt;)info proposedRow:(NSInteger)row proposedDropOperation:(NSTableViewDropOperation)operation;</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>- (BOOL)tableView:(NSTableView *)aTableView writeRowsWithIndexes:(NSIndexSet *)rowIndexes toPasteboard:(NSPasteboard *)pboard;</code></p></li>
</ol>

<p>The first one, <code>tableView:acceptDrop:row:dropOperation:</code> is used when someone has dragged something ONTO your NSTableView.  It's pretty straight-forward.  All the information about the drop (including what's being dropped) is found in <code>[info draggingPasteboard]</code>.  Return <code>YES</code> if the drop was successful, and <code>NO</code> otherwise.</p>

<p><code>tableView:validateDrop:proposedRow:proposedDropOperation:</code> is used when someone WANTS to drop something onto your NSTableView.  The originator of the drop, at this point, is unimportant.  All that matters is that they're hovering over you, and you have to say what they can do.  If, for example, they're hovering over a certain row (the 'proposedRow'), and you don't want to allow stuff to be dropped on that row, then return <code>NSDragOperationNone</code>.  Or maybe you want to copy what's in the information (return <code>NSDragOperationCopy</code>).  There's <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/ApplicationKit/Protocols/NSDraggingInfo%5FProtocol/Reference/Reference.html#//apple%5Fref/doc/uid/20000331-BAJJFEEE"">a whole bunch of different kinds of operations you can signify</a>.  Use the one that is appropriate for your needs.  (These return values will adjust the cursor accordingly.  So if you return NSDragOperationCopy, then the cursor will get the little green <code>+</code> circle.)</p>

<p>The final method, <code>tableView:writeRowsWithIndexes:toPasteboard:</code> is called when the user has selected some rows in your NSTableView and has begun to drag them.  You now have to provide the dragging pasteboard with the information that corresponds to those rows, so it can be dropped elsewhere.  Here's a simplified example of how I've used this method to provide NSManagedObjects to the pasteboard:</p>

<pre><code>- (BOOL)tableView:(NSTableView *)aTableView writeRowsWithIndexes:(NSIndexSet *)rowIndexes toPasteboard:(NSPasteboard *)pboard {
  [pboard declareTypes:[NSArray arrayWithObject:kMyCustomDragType] owner:self];
  //get an array of URIs for the selected objects
  NSMutableArray * rows = [NSMutableArray array];
  NSArray * selectedObjects = [arrayOfManagedObjects objectsAtIndexes:rowIndexes];
  for (NSManagedObject * o in selectedObjects) {
    [rows addObject:[[o objectID] URIRepresentation]];
  }
  NSData * encodedIDs = [NSKeyedArchiver archivedDataWithRootObject:rows];
  [pboard setData:encodedIDs forType:kMyCustomDragType];
  return YES;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The idea behind this is that I'm encoding the URIRepresentation of each selected NSManagedObject's objectID and putting that on the pasteboard.  I'm putting this data on the draggingPasteboard under the type ""kMyCustomDragType"" (an NSString), which means that only objects that have indicated that they accept drops of type kMyCustomDragType will be able to receive this drop.  I finally return <code>YES</code> to indicate that I have successfully written data to the pasteboard.  (Return <code>NO</code> if there was a failure)</p>

<p>If you can get this to work, then you've probably got 90% of all your drag and drop functionality that you'll need.  The other 10% would come from stranger requirements.  As always, <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/DragandDrop/DragandDrop.html"">the documentation will be your best friend</a>.</p>

"<p>Given the following sequence:</p>

<pre><code>""normal %(b)BOLD% normal""
</code></pre>

<p>I want to transform this into the following string:</p>

<pre><code>""0000000%(b)bbbb%0000000""
</code></pre>

<p>In other words, '%(b)' specifies that all characters up until the next '%' should be 'b'.  All other characters should be '0'.</p>

<p>I have tried numerous approaches, including using the RegexKitLite regular expression library but cannot seem to get my head around it.</p>

<p>Can anyone give me some pointers?</p>
","115730","","<p>Yeah, using regexes was my gut reaction too, but with your requirements, it'd probably be simpler just to scan the string.  Since you're dealing with individual characters, this will also be easiest to do in C.  So <a href=""http://xkcd.com/138/"" rel=""nofollow"">here are a couple pointers</a>: </p>

<pre><code>const char * original = [@""normal %(b)BOLD% normal"" UTF8String];
char * mutable = malloc((strlen(original)+1) * sizeof(char));
//we have to make a copy of the characters because we can't modify an NSString directly
strcpy(mutable, original);

//just a couple flags
char * pointer = mutable;
int isInBoldBlock = 0;
//loop until the end of the string
while (*pointer != '\0') {
  if (isInBoldBlock) {
    if (*pointer != '%') {
      //we're in a bold block and found a char that isn't %
      *pointer = 'b';
    } else {
      //we found the end of the bold block
      isInBoldBlock = 0;
    }
  } else {
    //look to see if we're going to start a bold section
    if (*pointer == '%' &amp;&amp; *(pointer+1) == '(' &amp;&amp; *(pointer+2) == 'b' &amp;&amp; *(pointer+3) == ')') {
      isInBoldBlock = 1;
      pointer += 3; //skip the %(b) characters
    } else {
      //we're not in a bold block, and we're not about to start one:
      *pointer = '0';
    }
  }
  //move to the next character
  pointer++;
}

//this will create a copy of ""mutable""
NSString * final = [[NSString alloc] initWithUTF8String:mutable];
//free the memory we allocated
free(mutable);
NSLog(@""Final: %@"", final);
//release the constructed string
[final release];
</code></pre>

<p>There might be a more ""Cocoa"" way to do this, particularly with NSScanner, but I am unfamiliar with this class, and the above method works.</p>

<p>CAVEAT IMPLEMENTOR: the ""%(b)"" and closing ""%"" bits MUST be the ASCII characters.  This will behave strangely if you have beyond-ascii characters in the string.  Consider transforming the string to ASCII before using this (with <code>-[NSString dataUsingEncoding:allowLossyConversion:]</code>).</p>

"<p>I have a relatively simple application which I need to make native Mac OSX version of.  I find it's easiest to learn from examples and I have never setup/developed/packaged a product on Mac yet.

","115730","","<p>I'm going to go out on a limb and say you're out of luck.  In the few years I've been surfing the web for Cocoa-related stuff, I've rarely come across skeleton applications.  Lots of sample projects, but not skeletons.</p>

"<p>I'm using Core Data to locally persist results from a Web Services call. The web service returns the full object model for, let's say, ""Cars"" - could be about 2000 of them (and I can't make the Web Service return anything less than 1 or ALL cars.</p>

"<p>Many iPhone code samples (from Apple, etc.) include code like this:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)viewDidLoad {
CGRect applicationFrame = [[UIScreen mainScreen] applicationFrame];

// add the top-most parent view
UIView *contentView = [[UIView alloc] initWithFrame:applicationFrame];
contentView.backgroundColor = [UIColor blackColor];
self.view = contentView;
[contentView release];

levelView = [[LevelView alloc] initWithFrame:applicationFrame viewController:self];
[self.view addSubview:levelView];

calibrationView = [[CalibrationView alloc] initWithFrame:applicationFrame viewController:self];
}
</code></pre>

<p>This snippet is from the BubbleLevel sample project.</p>

<p>My question: why is a release message sent to contentView?  We retain a reference to contentView in self.view and we clearly want to use it for the lifetime of the app, not just in this method.  Won't calling release cause the view to be released?</p>
","115730","","<p>Ölbaum is correct in saying that <code>self.view = contentView;</code> will retain your view, which means it won't be deallocated.  However, this behavior won't always be the case:</p>

<p>If you look in documentation (or the header) for UIViewController, you'll see that the <code>view</code> property is declared like this:</p>

<pre><code>@property(nonatomic, retain) UIView *view;
</code></pre>

<p>This means that whenever the view property is set (<code>foo.view = anotherView</code> or <code>[foo setView:anotherView];</code>), the other view will be retained.  If the <code>view</code> property were declared as:</p>

<pre><code>@property(nonatomic, assign) UIView *view;
</code></pre>

<p>Then the view would <em>not</em> be retained.  It would do a simple pointer assignation into the instance variable.  In this case, you would be correct that a subsequent <code>release</code> to <code>contentView</code> would destroy the view, which means the controller would have a stale pointer, which means your app would probably crash.</p>

<p>In other words, when you use properties, make sure you know if they're <code>retain</code> or <code>assign</code>.    (If it doesn't say, then it's <code>assign</code>).  Then handle your memory management accordingly.</p>

Category: CFArray (store-deque)<br />
Event Type: Malloc<br /><br />
Anyone know what i need to resolve it ?
Thanks !</strong></p>
","115730","","<p>The leak is in your for loop, and possibly also one before.</p>

<p>First, this line:</p>

<p><code>[self setMyVector:[[NSMutableArray alloc] initWithCapacity:size]];</code></p>

<p>If <code>setMyVector</code> retains the passed array (which, according to convention, it probably should), then you've leaked the array.  First you alloc and init the array.  It has a retain count of +1.  Then you set it into the myVector instance variable, which means it has a retain count of +2.  When you put something else into myVector, or you release the myVector variable in your <code>dealloc</code> method, you're going to decrement the retain count, which means it'll have a retain count of +1.  In other words, it won't be deallocated, and you've leaked the array.</p>

<p>The other, definite leak is inside your for() loop, where you have:</p>

<p><code>[myVector addObject: [[NSMutableArray alloc] initWithCapacity:size]];</code></p>

<p>Again, you create an array with a retain count of +1, then you add it to the myVector array, which will retain it again (+2).  However, you no longer have a pointer to the array, so you've leaked it.</p>

<p>Both of these leaks can be solved by using <code>[NSMutableArray arrayWithCapacity:size]</code> instead of the alloc/init approach.  This will create an autoreleased array, which will solve your memory leak.</p>

<p>If you don't know what autoreleasing is, then you may want to consider creating the array and storing it into a local variable, adding it to myVector (or setting it into myVector), and then immediately releasing it afterwards.</p>

"<p>I'm writing an xml serialization class for objective-c.<br/>
The point is to give the class a class type and an xml file.
It should return an instance with data.</p>

<p>I've got it working, and it does quite a bit - handles primitives (+nsstring), user defined classes and nsarrays. Doesn't handle pointers or C-arrays.<br/>
Obviously this relies heavily on reflection.</p>

<p>The question: When I set a value of an instance of some class, should I be checking if a property with the right name exists, or can I just set the variable using simple reflection?</p>

<p>This is the kind of code I've used so far:</p>

<pre><code>id newClass = class_createInstance(NSClassFromString(elementName), sizeof(unsigned));
Ivar nameVar = class_getInstanceVariable([newClass class], ""name"");
if (nameVar != nil)
    object_setIvar(newClass, nameVar, [NSString stringWithString:@""George""]);
</code></pre>

<p>Also, after this kind of assignment, should I release anything?</p>
","115730","","<p>Uh... you usually <em>don't</em> need to get so low into the runtime to do what that code does.  The following is fully functional and does exactly the same thing:</p>

<pre><code>id newObject = [[NSClassFromString(elementName) alloc] init];
@try {
  [newObject setValue:@""George"" forKey:@""name""];
@catch (NSException *e) {
  if ([[e name] isEqualToString:NSUndefinedKeyException]) {
    NSLog(@""%@ does not recognize the property \""name\"""", elementName);
  }
}

//... do stuff with newObject
[newObject release];
</code></pre>

<p>If you need to put in other things, like floats or ints or structs, you can box them into an NSValue (or subclass), and then pass those to <code>setValue:forKey:</code>.  For example:</p>

<pre><code>NSNumber * aFloat = [NSNumber numberWithFloat:42.0];
[newObject setValue:aFloat forKey:@""aFloatIvar""];

NSRect frame = NSMakeRect(0, 0, 42, 54);
NSValue * aStruct = [NSValue valueWithBytes:&amp;frame objcType:@encode(NSRect)];
[newObject setValue:aStruct forKey:@""aStructIvar""];

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
","115730","","<p>So in your button action method, you can do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>- (IBAction) showAlert {
  NSUInteger numComponents = [[myPickerView datasource] numberOfComponentsInPickerView:myPickerView];

  NSMutableString * text = [NSMutableString string];
  for(NSUInteger i = 0; i &lt; numComponents; ++i) {
    NSUInteger selectedRow = [myPickerView selectedRowInComponent:i];
    NSString * title = [[myPickerView delegate] pickerView:myPickerView titleForRow:selectedRow inComponent:i];
    [text appendFormat:@""Selected item \""%@\"" in component %lu\n"", title, i];
  }

  NSLog(@""%@"", text);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This would be the absolute formal way to retrieve information (by using the proper datasource and delegate methods), but it might be easier (depending on your set up), to just grab the selected row and then pull the information out of your model directly, instead of going through the delegate method.</p>

<p>If you wanted to be super cool about it, you could maybe construct a URL like: ""card://12345678890"", where 1234567890 is the identifier.  You could then set your app up to respond to ""card://"" urls.  Then send the card URL around via SMS.  When a user taps on the link in their SMS app, it'll automatically open up your app (providing that they have it downloaded and installed, and that nothing else has registered ""card://"").</p>

<p>For additional awesomeness, you can allow people to create ""shortcuts"" to their identifier (like bit.ly), so they can send around ""card://my-cool-business"" instead of ""card://1234567890"".</p>

<pre><code>NSArray * original = /* ... */;

<p>Is equivalent to:</p>

<p>I've created an instance of the object, put data into aDict, and now want to get rid of the object, cleaning up its memory in the process.  Two questions:</p>

<p>1) Should I release <strong>aDict</strong> in <strong>myClass</strong>'s <em>dealloc</em> method, as shown?</p>

<pre><code>[aDict release];
</code></pre>

<p>=============================================================================</p>

<p>2) I've nested several children dictionaries into <strong>aDict</strong>, represented by <strong>keyA</strong> and <strong>keyB</strong>, like so:</p>

<pre><code>// aDict:
{
    keyA =     {
        keyA1 = ""Hello world"";
        keyA2 = 1234;
    };
    keyB =     {
        keyB1 = Earth;
        keyB2 = 25000;
    };
}
</code></pre>

<p>Will a <strong>[aDict release]</strong> message ""propagate down the chain"" and cleanup all children dictionaries inside of aDict, including <em>their</em> key/value objects?  Or, do I have to do something else to get rid of them?</p>
","115730","","<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Collection objects retain the things they're collecting, so when the collection is deallocated, it balances the retain with a release.</p>

<p>Then if one of the dictionaries it was holding onto is deallocated, it will also release its key/value pairs, since the dictionary is a collection, and collection objects retain the things they're collecting.</p>

<p>The same holds true for arrays and sets.</p>

<p>However, you have a bug in your code.  You have:</p>

<pre><code>- (void) setADict: (NSMutableDictionary *) newDict
{
    [aDict release];
    [newDict retain];
    aDict = newDict;
}</code></pre>

<p>Consider the case when <code>newDict</code> is the same object as <code>aDict</code>.  Then you release the dictionary, it is deallocated, and then you attempt to retain it, but whoops!  It's no longer there.</p>

<p>There are three alternatives to fixing this.  Here they are:</p>

<pre><code>    - (void) setADict: (NSMutableDictionary *) newDict
    {
        [aDict autorelease];
        [newDict retain];
        aDict = newDict;
    }

    - (void) setADict: (NSMutableDictionary *) newDict
    {
      if (aDict != newDict) {
        [aDict release];
        [newDict retain];
        aDict = newDict;
      }
    }

    - (void) setADict: (NSMutableDictionary *) newDict
    {
        [newDict retain];
        [aDict release];
        aDict = newDict;
    }</code></pre>

<p>I'd say the third one is simplest, the second one is fastest over time, and the first is <em>meh</em>.  The first will clutter up your autorelease pools (which may or may not lead to memory bloat).  The second and third are equivalent in terms of safety and property memory management.  However, the second will save you unnecessary method calls if you happen to be setting the same dictionary over itself.</p>

"<p>I have a UIView subclass (<code>CustomView</code> for purposes of this question) that has its own handling of all <code>touches</code> events (Began, Moved, Ended, Cancelled). I also have a <code>UIButton</code> that is a sibling of <code>CustomView</code> that overlaps it.</p>

<p>For example, my view hierarchy looks like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>UIView (Controller's view)
<ul>
<li>CustomView with frame (0, 0, 300, 300)</li>
<li>UIButton with frame (0, 0, 100, 50)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>I would like the CustomView to capture touch events once the user has dragged out of the UIButton. Through debug logging, it appears that the <code>UIControlEventTouchDragExit</code> event is the one to intercept (though it doesn't fire until the touch is around 100 pixels away from the button, but that is not important to this question).</p>

<p>Ideally, when the drag exit event is fired, the button would stop receiving touch move events, the CustomView would get a <code>touchesBegan</code> event (even if I need to fake one myself somehow), and all future touch events (<code>touchesMoved</code>, etc) would be sent to the CustomView.</p>

<p>I have tried the following, and it doesn't have any effect:</p>

<pre><code>-(void)btnTouchDragExit:(id)sender
{
    UIButton * btn = sender;
    [btn resignFirstResponder];
    [customView becomeFirstResponder];
}

","115730","","<p>Just use hitTest:withEvent: to figure out what view ""should"" be receiving the event, then forward on the event to the appropriate view.

So what's going wrong ? Does anyone have a clue or idea ?</p>
","115730","","<p>Let's step through this, find your bug, and solve a memory leak:</p>

<p>First, you create an NSMutableString.  Great. (+1 retain count)</p>

<p>Then you append another string onto your NSMutableString.  That's fine.  (still +1 retain count).</p>

<p>Then you trim the newlineCharacterSet, which returns... an autoreleased NSString.  Since this object is different from your original object, you've leaked your original object (since it had a +1 retain count and you no longer have a pointer to it), and you now have an immutable NSString to boot.  This means that the next time this method gets called, you're going to try to append a string onto an NSString, which will throw the ""can't mutate an immutable object"" exception.  </p>

<p>Here's the quick way to solve this:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)parser:(NSXMLParser *)parser foundCharacters:(NSString *)string {

</code></pre>

<p>The trick is the <code>valueForKey:</code> method of <code>NSArray</code>.  That will iterate through your array (<code>myArrayOfCustomObjects</code>), call the <code>-state</code> method on each object, and build an array of the results.  We then create an <code>NSSet</code> with the resulting array of states to remove duplicates.</p>

<hr>

<p>Starting with iOS 5 and OS X 10.7, there's a new class that can do this as well: <code>NSOrderedSet</code>.  The advantage of an ordered set is that it will remove any duplicates, but also maintain relative order.</p>

<pre><code>NSArray *states = [myArrayOfCustomObjects valueForKey:@""state""];
NSOrderedSet *orderedSet = [NSOrderedSet orderedSetWithArray:states];
NSSet *uniqueStates = [orderedSet set];

"<p>I have a pretty simple question.  While I am fairly new to Objective-C, I have gotten pretty comfortable with the language and the memory management model.</p>

<p>I understand ownership pretty well and the notion of explicit and implicit.  I also understand that when you add anything to a collection, it takes ownership of the keys and values and releases that ownership on release.</p>

<p>My question relates to the releasing of a collection of collections (aka a Bag).  I have the following code:</p>

<pre><code>
    // levelDict is a member NSMutableDictionary on the Class

    BOOL newDict = NO;
    BOOL newArray = NO;

    NSNumber *levelKey = [NSNumber numberWithInt:toLevel];
    NSMutableDictionary *dict = [levelDict objectForKey:levelKey];
    if ( dict == nil ) {
    	dict = [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] init];
    	[levelDict setObject:dict forKey:levelKey];
    	newDict = YES;
    }

    // Now look for the array...
    NSNumber *typeKey = [NSNumber numberWithInt:objectType];
    NSMutableArray *array = [dict objectForKey:typeKey];
    if ( array == nil ) {
    	array = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init];
    	[dict setObject:array forKey:typeKey];
    	newArray = YES;
    }

    // Now add the object to the array...
    [array addObject:object];

    // Deal with our memory management
    if ( newArray ) {
    	[array release];
    }

    if ( newDict ) {
    	[dict release];
    }
</code></pre>

<p>This code creates a Map where each entry then contains an Array (aka Bag).  If I release the dictionary object levelDict which owns the array of objects for each entry, I am assuming that release will cascade through the arrays as well?  Or do I have to iterate over the dictionary and explicitly release each of the arrays?</p>

<p>Now for the extra credit question - why am I doing this versus defining a single object of collections?  Well, in other languages like Java, Object instantiation can get very expensive. I am assuming this is the case with Objective-C. Maps of associative arrays are very efficient.  </p>

<p>Thanks

"<p>How can I exclude the call and sms feature from Ipod Touch but still retain it's functionality on the iPhone. The iPod Touch of course has no phone and sms is available via an optional app. Tech support kindly suggested I take a look at the system call ""sysctlbyname"" and the section on ""CTL_HW"" from the Apple provided iPhoneOS reference documentation.

<p>They said it is necessary to check the machine class and machine type to determine if the device is capable of supporting phone calling. Well I looked at it and it's Greek to me. On the other hand can this snippet from your forum:</p>

<pre><code>[Bind(Exclude=""ID, Name"")]
</code></pre>

<p>be used to exclude assess to my in-app Contact Book feature on the iPod Touch? If so, I imagine it would be inserted into the RetrieveContactInfoViewController.m file, but in which section. (of course there are RetrieveContactInfoViewAppDelegate files available also).  How can I exclude phone features from the iPod Touch?</p>
","115730","","<p>If I understand your question correctly, you want to limit features of your own app based on whether the app is running on an iPod touch versus an iPhone?  If that's the case... (if not, you need to rephrase your question)</p>

<p><a href=""http://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIDevice%5FClass/Reference/UIDevice.html#//apple%5Fref/doc/uid/TP40006902-CH3-SW1"" rel=""nofollow"">Check out this page in the documentation</a>.</p>

<p>It's for the <code>UIDevice</code> class, which allows you to access basic information regarding the device on which the app is running.  The method linked to above is the ""model"" property of the UIDevice.  It can be very useful.  For example:</p>

<pre><code>if ([[[UIDevice currentDevice] model] rangeOfString:@""iPhone""].location != NSNotFound) {
  NSLog(@""I am running on an iPhone (or in the simulator)"");
} else {
  NSLog(@""I am running on an iPod touch"");
}
</code></pre>

<p>To use that in a large number of places could be tedious.  This is where it would be helpful to make a category on UIDevice, like so:</p>

<pre><code>//UIDevice+ModelInfo.h
@interface UIDevice (ModelInfo)
- (BOOL) isiPhone;
@end

//UIDevice+ModelInfo.m
@implementation UIDevice (ModelInfo)

- (BOOL) isiPhone {
  static BOOL isiPhone;
  static BOOL modelTypeInitialized;
  if (modelTypeInitialized == NO) {
    modelTypeInitialized = YES;
    isiPhone = ([[self model] rangeOfString:@""iPhone""] != NSNotFound);
  }
  return isiPhone;
}

@end
</code></pre>

<p>That will even cache the result for you so it only does the string comparison once.  Now you can do:</p>

<pre><code>#import ""UIDevice+ModelInfo.h""
if ([[UIDevice currentDevice] isiPhone]) {
  NSLog(@""Do something iPhoney"");
} else {
  NSLog(@""I cannot do iPhoney things"");
}

<p>Then when the user draws the red line, use that to build a path as a mask on the invisible layer.  When the path is finished, fill in the path with black (on the mask), to make that portion totally opaque.

"<p>I have a CSV file containing data.
I want to load it into a Core Data managed sqlite db.</p>

<p>I just ran one of the sample Core Data Xcode apps and noticed it created the db file.
I noticed table names all started with Z and the primary keys were stored in separate table so from this am I right in presuming that just importing the CSV data directly into the db using sqlite3 command line might mess up primary keys.</p>

<p>Do I need to write a program to read in the CSV line by line and then create objects for each row and persist them to the db.
Anyone got any code for this?
And can I write a desktop client to do this using Core Data. If so will the db be fine to use in IPhone core data app?</p>

<p>Can I then just include the prefilled db in my project and it will be deployed with the app correctly or is there something else I should do.</p>

","115730","","<p>Short answer:  No.</p>

<p>Long answer: how would this work?  Imagine you <em>could</em> add methods to existing protocols?  How would this work?  Imagine we wanted to add another method to NSCoding, say <code>-(NSArray *) codingKeys;</code>  This method is a required method that returns an array of the keys used to encoding the object.</p>

<p>The problem is that there are existing classes (like, say NSString) that already implement NSCoding, but don't implement our <code>codingKeys</code> method.  What should happen?  How would the pre-compiled framework know what to do when this <em>required</em> message gets sent to a class that does not implement it?</p>

<p>You could say ""we can add the definition of this method via a category"" or ""we could say that any methods added via these protocol categories are explicitly optional"".  Yes, you could do this and theoretically get around the problem I've described above.  But if you're going to do that, you might as well just make it a category in the first place, and then check to make sure the class <code>respondsToSelector:</code> before invoking the method.</p>

"<p>I am looking to make a custom window which would look something like this (never mind the quick photoshop):</p>

<p><img src=""http://i35.tinypic.com/20ff803.png"" alt=""alt text"" /></p>

<p>The main problem I have is not to make the window transparent (although I guess any info is welcome!), but that I want to be able to click only on the visible part of the buttons. For example, if I click just outside the top left of the ""5"" button, I want it to register a click on the ""1"" button and not the ""5"" button, even though I clicked in button 5's bounding box. And if I click just ouside of the ""1"" button's top left ""corner"", I want it to click on whatever is beneath my window and not on the button. I also need to be able to resize this window and the pictures in the buttons should resize with them.</p>

<p>I was thinking of using a transparent NSWindow with transparent NSButtons containing PNGs with alpha for each button but I think the overlapping buttons will be a problem.</p>

<p>I have also heard about applications like Bowtie, SweetFM and others using WebKit to display their interfaces. If that is a possibility on at least 10.3 that would be interesting, but I don't know how that would work either.</p>

<p>I looked around for click masks, areas or something like that but I haven't found anything yet. I will update this post as I find more info (if I do!).</p>

<p>Any hints on how to proceed?</p>

<p>(Note that I am working on 10.4 and <em>ideally</em> I need to support some older versions of Mac OS X too.)</p>

<p>(Also, I found the ""rounded window"" example on Apple's dev. site but it doesn't run on 10.4 anymore so I'm not sure this is the way to go.)</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<h1>UPDATE:</h1>

<p><em>(see update 2, this problem is fixed now)</em></p>

<p>OK now I'm having a slightly different (but not unrelated) issue. What I did so far is this:</p>

<p>I opted for making a custom control that I'll be able to use for each of my buttons:</p>

<p>1- Subclass NSControl and override drawRect, mouseUp, mouseDragged and mouseDown. This way I can get the behavior I want when dragging on a button (move the window).</p>

<p>2- Load images for each button states (same shape but one is darkened) into NSImages and draw them into the view using <code>compositeToPoint:fromRect:operation:</code> when necessary. The images are <strong>185 x 185</strong> pixels <strong>PNG files with alpha</strong> exported from Photoshop.</p>

<p>3- Get the NSImage's bitmap representation:</p>

<pre><code>NSBitmapImageRep *bitRep = [[NSBitmapImageRep imageRepWithData:[unpressedImage TIFFRepresentation]] retain];
</code></pre>

<p><em>OR</em></p>

<pre><code>NSBitmapImageRep *bitRep = [[unpressedImage representations] objectAtIndex:0];
</code></pre>

<p>Both seem to give the same result. I tried compositing this bitmap rep onto my window to see if the image has same size and look as the original and all seems good (you'll see why I did that after this enumeration...).</p>

<p>4- In the mouse event methods, I use the bitmap representation to get the alpha component for a particular point:</p>

<pre><code>NSPoint mouse = [self convertPoint:[theEvent locationInWindow] fromView:nil]; // Returns the correct x and y positions on the control (i.e: between 0 and 185 for each axis).

NSColor *colorUnderMouse = [[[unpressedImage representations] objectAtIndex:0] colorAtX:mouse.x y:mouse.y];
float alpha = [colorUnderMouse alphaComponent];
</code></pre>

<p>Then I print the alpha value to the console but I am getting very weird results. Getting the alpha component and the color under the mouse seems to work at first glance (the colors and alpha returned are in my bitmap) but it looks like the color is not taken at the right point in the <code>bitRep</code>, or the image contained in the <code>bitRep</code> is distorted (it isn't distorted when I composite the <code>bitRep</code> on the window though, which is very strange). Again I double-checked the x and y mouse coordinates were in the (0,185) range and that the size of the <code>NSBitmapImageRep</code> is 185 x 185 too.</p>

<p>First it looks like the <code>NSBitmapImageRep</code> is flipped horizontally compared to my <code>NSImage</code>. If I flip my coordinates the values returned seem mostly OK (most of the shape seems to fit with the values returned) but there are still parts of the image which return wrong values.</p>

<p>I'm clueless at this point and having never worked with <code>NSBitmapImageRep</code> before maybe I just forgot to specify some format information about my image which would be why the values are off. Could someone clarify this please?</p>

<p>Thanks again!</p>

<h1>UPDATE 2:</h1>

<p>Ok never mind, I found the issue. I used the setColor:atX:y: method to draw a colored dot on the bitRep before printing it on my window and the issue was clear as day: the Y coordinate is reversed in the bitRep, but the image is printed with the ""good"" orientation. This means that the bitRep has ""Windows-style"" top-left origin coordinate system while the window has the cartesian coordinate system (bottom-left) origin. Simply reversing my Y coordinate fixed the issues I had getting the alpha component and color.</p>

<p>This must have been written somewhere in the docs, sorry to have bothered you because of my lack of research...!</p>
","115730","","<p>What about making it all a single control?  It might make drawing a little bit complex, but it looks like you're doing custom drawing anyway.</p>

<p>If you did it as a single control, you could first check and see if the click point is within the center circle.  If it's not, then all you have to do is identify which quadrant it's in to know which ""button"" it belongs to (while also verifying that the click fits within the outer circle).</p>

<p>Alternatively, you could create a transparent view over your buttons that captures the click events and forwards them on to the appropriate control based on the logic I just specified.</p>

<p>I'm not concerned about the ""will be removed in a future release"" (it just has to work on Snow Leopard), and I don't think root-owned processes are an issue (all GUI applications should be running as the current), but presumably the code would have to be injected into many 64-bit applications (Finder/Safari/etc)</p>

<p>As you can see, in the ""Allowed Toolbar Items"" the image looks fine for the ""PHP"" toolbar item, and when its actually in the toolbar, it scales weirdly. </p>

<p>Thanks</p>
","115730","","<p>Found this in the documentation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The displayed resolution of an image item is dependent on the sizeMode of the toolbar. You should provide image representations specific to the default, regular and small size modes in a single image that supports multiple image representations such as icns or tiff. The appropriate image representation is automatically displayed for the toolbar's current sizeMode. <em>If an appropriate representation is not available, the toolbar scales the representation to the appropriate size for the current mode, at a cost in performance and appearance.</em> Images that are not square are scaled to fit. An image item’s image is also scaled down and used in the image item’s overflow menu item. (Emphasis added)</p>

"<p>I am trying to floss daily, get my exercise, and make sure I maintain a balance between my retains and releases.</p>

<p>Here is what has me puzzled. I have a ivar:</p>

<pre><code>NSMutabledata *_alignmentData
</code></pre>

<p>and a synthesized property associated with it:</p>

<pre><code>// .h file
@property (nonatomic, retain) NSMutableData *alignmentData;

// .m file
@synthesize alignmentData=_alignmentData;
</code></pre>

<p>I start to pull data from a server asynchronously:</p>

<pre><code>self.connection = 
[[[NSURLConnection alloc] initWithRequest:theRequest delegate:self] autorelease];
</code></pre>

<p>And immediately after allocate a data buffer to be used subsequently in the asynchronous callbacks:</p>

<pre><code>// This prints 0. Cool.
NSLog(@""BEFORE [_alignmentData retainCount] = %d"", [_alignmentData retainCount]);

// Create a place to receive the data that will arrive asynchronously:
self.alignmentData = [NSMutableData data];

// This prints 2. Shouldn't this be 1 ?!?
NSLog(@"" AFTER [_alignmentData retainCount] = %d"", [_alignmentData retainCount]);
</code></pre>

<p>To complicate matters in the first asynchronous callback that fires after the above allocation of self.alignmentData, I inspect the retain count again:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)connection:(NSURLConnection *)connection didReceiveResponse:(NSURLResponse *)response {

    // This prints 1. 
    NSLog(@""[_alignmentData retainCount] = %d"", [_alignmentData retainCount]);
    [self.alignmentData setLength:0];

}
</code></pre>

<p>So, it appears that the retain count rises to 2 from 0 then drops to 1. Can someone explain to me how this is possible? </p>

<p>Note: I've been told not to use retain counts as a debugging aid but that is simply not practical in a non-garbage collected language such as Objective-C.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Retain Count</strong></p>
  
  <p>Typically there should be no reason to explicitly ask an object what its retain count is (see <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Protocols/NSObject%5FProtocol/Reference/NSObject.html#//apple%5Fref/occ/intfm/NSObject/retainCount"" rel=""nofollow"">retainCount</a>). The result is often misleading, as you may be unaware of what framework objects have retained an object in which you are interested. In debugging memory management issues, you should be concerned only with ensuring that your code adheres to the ownership rules.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I've never come across a situation where it's been useful to query an object's retainCount.  If you follow proper memory management rules, you'll be fine.</p>

<p>As for your actual question, autoreleases don't happen immediately.  They happen whenever the current autorelease pool happens to be popped.  Since you're not explicitly managing any autorelease pools, then you have no control over when that autorelease happens.  However, since you seem to be following correct memory management rules, you have nothing to worry about.</p>

","115730","","<p>You're misunderstanding how dictionaries work.  Dictionaries store a <em>single</em> value for a <em>single</em> key.  So after your code runs, <code>myDict</code> will hold a single key-value pair: <code>@""products""</code> => <code>@""grapes""</code>.  If you need a key to point to multiple objects, then your key will need to point to an <code>NSMutableArray</code> (or <code>NSMutableSet</code> if you don't care about order), and then you add and remove things from the <code>NSMutableArray</code> rather than from the dictionary.</p>

<p>If this is going to be the basic structure for everything in your dictionary, you might want to consider making a wrapper for your dictionary, like so:</p>

<pre><code>//DDMutableMultiValueDictionary.h
@interface DDMutableMultiValueDictionary : NSObject {
  NSMutableDictionary * dict;
}

- (void) addObject:(id)value forKey:(id)key;
- (void) removeObject:(id)value forKey:(id)key;
- (BOOL) containsObject:(id)value forKey:(id)key;

@end

//DDMutableMultiValueDictionary.m
#import ""DDMutableMultiValueDictionary.h""

@implementation DDMutableMultiValueDictionary

- (id) init {
  if (self = [super init]) {
    dict = [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] init];
  }
  return self;
}

- (void) dealloc {
  [dict release];
  [super dealloc];
}

- (void) addObject:(id)value forKey:(id)key {
  NSMutableArray * values = [dict objectForKey:key];
  if (values == nil) {
    values = [NSMutableArray array];
    [dict setObject:values forKey:key]
  }
  [values addObject:value];
}

- (void) removeObject:(id)value forKey:(id)key {
  NSMutableArray * values = [dict objectForKey:key];
  [values removeObject:value];
}

- (BOOL) containsObject:(id)value forKey:(id)key {
  NSMutableArray * values = [dict objectForKey:key];

"<p>In Unix shell programming the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipe%5F%28computing%29"">pipe operator</a> is an extremely powerful tool. With a small set of core utilities, a systems language (like C) and a scripting language (like Python) you can construct extremely compact and powerful shell scripts, that are automatically parallelized by the operating system. </p>

<p>Obviously this is a very powerful programming paradigm, but I haven't seen pipes as first class abstractions in any language other than a shell script. The code needed to replicate the functionality of scripts using pipes seems to always be quite complex.</p>

<p>So my question is why don't I see something similar to Unix pipes in modern high-level languages like C#, Java, etc.? Are there languages (other than shell scripts) which do support first class pipes? Isn't it a convenient and safe way to express concurrent algorithms?  </p>

<p>Just in case someone brings it up, I looked at the F# pipe-forward operator (forward pipe operator), and it looks more like a function application operator. It applies a function to data, rather than connecting two streams together, as far as I can tell, but I am open to corrections.</p>

<p><strong>Postscript</strong>: While doing some research on implementing coroutines, I realize that there are certain parallels. In a <a href=""http://blogs.infosupport.com/blogs/martinw/archive/2006/04/19/5345.aspx"">blog post</a> Martin Wolf describes a similar problem to mine but in terms of coroutines instead of pipes. </p>

"<h2>Background</h2>

<p>I'm a developer who's in the throes of building an application for the Mac. I'm about to get my hands on Snow Leopard. Until now I've been building on Leopard. I've only been doing Cocoa development for about a year not very intensely.</p>

<p>I've read a lot about Snow Leopard and Grand Central Dispatch in particular. I'm aware that it uses blocks, but I've not got into the nitty gritty of how blocks work or how Grand Central Dispatch works.</p>

<h2>My Question</h2>

<p>How do I best develop one code base for both Snow Leopard and Leopard, whilst taking advantage to the most degree possible of the new multi threading stuff in Snow Leopard?</p>

<p><strong>NSOperationQueue</strong></p>

<p>My instinct is not to deal with GCD directly in my code, but when things need putting on a Queue, use NSOperationQueue, since I've read from Mike Ashes Q&amp;A sessions that in Snow Leopard, NSOperationQueue takes full advantage of GCD and the crasher he discovered in Leopard has now been fixed.</p>

<p><strong>Manual Thread Management</strong></p>

<p>However, when it comes to managing specific background threads, is there any way to take advantage of the easier to use thread management stuff in Snow Leopard without breaking things in Leopard? Or would people recommend I have different targets for each OS with some different classes in each? This to me would seem like a maintenance nightmare just waiting to happen.</p>

<p>Or maybe I should just live with not having my app optimised fully for Snow Leopard and stick with <code>+(void)detachNewThreadSelector:toTarget:withObject:</code> or something similar.</p>

<p>What do people think?</p>
","115730","","<p>One way would be to understand what APIs in Leopard have been modified in Snow Leopard to use GCD.  For example, NSOperation and NSOperationQueue in Leopard work as they always have.  However in Snow Leopard, they've been rewritten to take advantage of GCD underneath.  Voilá.  Instant upgrade for your 10.6 users.</p>

<p>Another option would be to use something like <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/plblocks/"" rel=""nofollow"">PLBlocks</a> and compile GCD into your code yourself.  I have no idea if that'll work, but it might be worth a shot.  =)</p>

"<p>I'm very new to Cocoa for MacOSX, but I can't help but feel like I'm constantly fighting Interface Builder.</p>

<p>My current situation is that I'm building an app that will have several custom controls and views. I started building the app in Interface Builder because it was initially very easy to drag things around and get them into the correct spots with the proper colors and the correct autosizing rules. However the time has come to start building my custom controls and views - which I can't nicely represent in Interface Builder without going through the work of building an IBPlugin! The only other option I know of it is to have an Interface Builder document that includes a bunch of ""Custom Views"" all over the place with only their class changed. It suddenly seems pointless to even bother with IB - especially in light of that fact that these controls and views will have properties such as color that need to be set - just like the other views and controls already in the IB document. So now I've got visualization properties being set in two disconnected places and seems to counter one of the potential advantages of IB which is making it relatively easy to tweak the UI of the app without digging into code.</p>

<p>I'm also faced with a situation where a few controls change properties (such as colors) based on data or current selections. So now I have initial default colors of the control specified in Interface Builder, but I have to specify the data-driven colors in code? Once again Interface Builder seems to cause me to have to split some presentation settings between it's world and the code. I suppose it's possible to solve this somewhat with a complex plugin that knows about my data or states or whatever, but it seems like I'd end up maintaing a ton of support code that exists just so the Interface Builder experience remains ""right.""</p>

<p>Something else that I often see mentioned is how easily IB allows you to define bindings between components. ""You can do it without writing any code!"" Again, I may be missing something, but binding one property to another is a single line of code as far as I can tell. Is setting a couple properties in a box in IB really better than writing that one single line of code? And why is it better to put what amounts to application logic in the presentation layer's specification?</p>

<p>Like I said at the open, I'm pretty new to this Cocoa stuff, but I feel like either I'm missing something very important about how to use Interface Builder, or it's designed primarily for trivial demo applications with a high ""wow"" factor.</p>
","115730","","<p>I find that Interface Builder is excellent for getting the generic layout of an app.  It's also wonderful for things like bindings (on the Mac).  However, there's no way you're going to create Delicious Library using Interface Builder.  The more complex your interface, the more code you'll have to write.</p>

  <p>Key-value entries are inserted just as in a normal dictionary, including replacement of values for existing keys, as detailed in -setObject:forKey:. However, an additional structure is used in parallel to track insertion order, and keys are enumerated in that order. If a key to be added does not currently exist in the dictionary, it is added to the end of the list, otherwise the insertion order of the key does not change.</p>

<p>My apologies to all you advanced programers, I'm new at this and could not find the answer in the NSObject documentation either.  Thanks.</p>
","115730","","<p>I feel the answers so far are missing the point of the question.  Your error is saying that the <code>Names</code> class doesn't implement <code>isEqualToString:</code> method.  This is being called (presumably) because the <code>UITableViewCell</code> only changes the <code>text</code> of its <code>textLabel</code> if the string is different from what's being displayed, and it's performing this comparison using <code>isEqualToString:</code>, because <code>cell.textLabel.text</code> is an <code>NSString</code> property.</p>

<p>However, you're not giving it an <code>NSString</code>.  You're giving it a <code>Names</code> object, so of course it's not going to work.  Since <code>Names</code> is obviously a custom object, you must provide a method to extract a string representation from this object, and you must explicitly invoke that method yourself.</p>

<p>For example, you might implement a method called <code>-asString</code> (which would be a horrible name, but this is to illustrate a point), that might look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>- (NSString*) asString {
  return [NSString stringWithFormat:@""This name is %@"", aNameIvar];
}
</code></pre>

<p>You would then use it like this:</p>

<pre><code>Name * thisName = [namesArray objectAtIndex:indexPath.row];
cell.textLabel.text = [thisName asString];
return cell;
</code></pre>

<p>The proper name for this method would be <code>-stringValue</code>.  <code>-stringValue</code> is used on several Cocoa objects to return a string representation of the data that they hold, such as <code>NSNumber</code>, <code>NSCell</code> (Mac), etc.</p>

"<p>NSMutableURLRequest apparently changes case on header fields.</p>

<li><code>GameLevel</code> doesn't need to be alloc/init'd at all.  You can just pull the value out of <code>[settings objectForKey:kLevelKey];</code>, assign it into your <code>GameLevel</code> string, and use that.  Then you don't even have to release it.</li>
<li>Your loop is... odd.  You're iterating through the loop, but each time you iterate, you set the <code>self.QDetailsByLevel</code> property to a new value.  Are you sure that's what you want?</li>
<li>This: <code>if (level != GameLevel)</code> does not do what you think it does.  That's comparing pointers (ie, the ADDRESSES of two objects in memory).  In your current state, both <code>level</code> and <code>GameLevel</code> have been alloc/init'd, which means they will <em>never</em> be the same object.  You're probably wanting <code>if ([level isEqualToString:GameLevel] == NO)</code> instead.</li>
<li>You subtract one from <code>[self.QuestionsByLevel count]</code> to get your <code>QuestionCount</code> int, which would appear to be an upper bound on a for() loop.  Yet the conditional on the for loop (which @Michael showed to be your problem) subtracts <em>another</em> 1 from <code>QuestionCount</code>, which means that your for() loop will never reach the last element in the array.

"<p>I have a custom <code>NSView</code> (it's one of many and they all live inside an <code>NSCollectionView</code> — I don't think that's relevant, but who knows). When I click the view, I want it to change its selection state (and redraw itself accordingly); when I double-click the view, I want it to pop up a larger preview window for the object that was just double-clicked.</p>

<p>My first looked like this: </p>

<pre><code>- (void)mouseUp: (NSEvent *)theEvent {
    if ([theEvent clickCount] == 1) [model setIsSelected: ![model isSelected]];
    else if ([theEvent clickCount] == 2) if ([model hasBeenDownloaded]) [mainWindowController showPreviewWindowForPicture:model];
}
</code></pre>

<p>which mostly worked fine. Except, when I double-click the view, the selection state changes <em>and</em> the window pops up. This is not exactly what I want. </p>

<p>It seems like I have two options. I can either revert the selection state when responding to a double-click (undoing the errant single-click) or I can finagle some sort of <code>NSTimer</code> solution to build in a delay before responding to the single click. In other words, I can make sure that a second click is not forthcoming before changing the selection state.</p>

<p>This seemed more elegant, so it was the approach I took at first. The only real guidance I found from Google was on an unnamed site with a hyphen in its name. This approach mostly works with one big caveat.</p>

<p>The outstanding question is ""How long should my <code>NSTimer</code> wait?"". The unnamed site suggests using the Carbon function <code>GetDblTime()</code>. Aside from being unusable in 64-bit apps, the only documentation I can find for it says that it's returning clock-ticks. And I don't know how to convert those into seconds for <code>NSTimer</code>. </p>

<p>So what's the ""correct"" answer here? Fumble around with <code>GetDblTime()</code>? ""Undo"" the selection on a double-click? I can't figure out the Cocoa-idiomatic approach.</p>
","115730","","<p>Delaying the changing of the selection state is (from what I've seen) the recommended way of doing this.</p>

"<p>The goal is to generate an NSString  chars in length and assign each string to an array. I'm getting stuck on what I need to do with my algorithm to get the correct result.  Here's the sample.  The result I get is  the same randomly generated string added to my array 26 times instead of 26 DIFFERENT strings added. </p>

<p>I've thought about declaring 26 different NSStrings and assigning each result from the algorithm to each string, but that seems inefficient.  Thanks for the help.</p>

    if([randomString length] &lt; strLength) {
      [randomString insertString: letterToAdd atIndex: i];
    }

","115730","","<p>Here's how I would do it:</p>

<pre><code>#import ""NSString+Shuffle.h""
NSString * string = @""expert"";
NSUInteger strLength = [string length];
NSString * alphabet = @""abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"";
NSMutableSet * randomWords = [NSMutableSet set];

while ([randomWords count] &lt; 26) {
  NSString * newWord = [alphabet shuffledString];
  newWord = [newWord substringToIndex:strLength];
  [randomArray addObject:newWord];
}
NSLog(@""Random set count %d, contents: %@"", [randomWords count], randomWords);
</code></pre>

<p>You'd then need a category on <code>NSString</code> that defines <code>shuffledString</code>.  This method would simply take the characters in the string and rearrange them randomly.  Decent shuffle algorithms can be found quite easily with Google.</p>

<p>I hope you get the basic idea of how this works. The only modification I made is using an NSSet instead of an NSArray, and what the conditional on the loop is.  The eliminates the (slim) possibility of duplicate random words.</p>

<p>Edit: since I'm feeling generous, here's a basic <code>shuffledString</code> implementation:</p>

<pre><code>//NSString+Shuffle.h
@interface NSString (ShuffleAdditions)

- (NSString *) shuffledString;

@end

//NSString+Shuffle.m
#import ""NSString+Shuffle.h""

@implementation NSString (ShuffleAdditions)

- (NSString *) shuffledString {
  NSMutableString * shuffled = [self mutableCopy];
  NSUInteger length = [shuffled length];
  for (int i = 0; i &lt; (4*length); ++i) {
    NSString * randomChar = [shuffled subStringWithRange:NSMakeRange(arc4random() % (length-1), 1)];
    [shuffled appendString:randomChar];
  }
  return [shuffled autorelease];

<pre><code>+(id) dataPoint {
    return [[[self alloc] init] autorelease];

</code></pre>

<p>rather than (where you would release in main)</p>

","115730","","<p>According to naming conventions, you should call it <code>+dataPoint</code>.  The reason the analyzer is barfing at you is because (by convention), a class method that uses ""new"" is expected to return an object with a +1 retain count.  You're returning an object with a +0 (autoreleased) retain count, and are therefore breaking convention.</p>

<p>As was alluded to in @Peter's answer, to create an empty object, it's usually done with <code>[ClassName className]</code> methods.  Ex:  <code>[NSArray array]</code>, <code>[NSData data]</code>, <code>[NSString string]</code>, etc.  So the proper thing for you to do would be to rename it <code>[DataPoint dataPoint]</code> and then implement it as <code>return [[[self alloc] init] autorelease];</code></p>

<p>Using <code>[self alloc]</code> is preferable, since it translates down to subclasses.  IE, if you create a MutableDataPoint subclass, then (if you use <code>[self alloc]</code>) doing <code>[MutableDataPoint dataPoint]</code> returns a <code>MutableDataPoint</code>, whereas if you leave it as <code>[DataPoint alloc]</code>, it would come back as a <code>DataPoint</code> object (because that's what you're allocating).  (On a side note, <code>self</code> refers to the object being operated on in the context of the method.  For instance methods, it's the instance.  For class methods, it's the <code>Class</code> object itself)</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>If you do want the class method to return an object with a +1 retain count, then (by convention), you'd just need to call it <code>+new</code> (ie, <code>DataPoint * p = [DataPoint new];</code>).  However, use of the <code>+new</code> method seems to have fallen into more-or-less disuse, with <code>+alloc/-init...</code> or a class convenience method being the favorable alternatives.</p>

<p>Edit #2 (Re: Edit_003):</p>

<p>I personally prefer the former (<code>+dataPoint</code>), but only because <code>+new</code> isn't as common and I don't have to remember to <code>-release</code> the object.  Either one is perfectly acceptable and correct, though.</p>

"<p>I asked a similar question, but I couldn't get it working exactly. I'm building an iPhone app, and there is a method that I want called from different files. I figured the easiest way would simply be to make a method in another file, and call the method from the other files.</p>

<p>Here are some problems. I need to return multiple values from the method, after passing it multiple values. For example, I'm passing it: <code>(int, int, int, string, string)</code>.  And it needs to return all of those values, after they have been changed. Someone showed me this code:</p>

<pre><code>- (NSDictionary *)EndOfTurn:(int)varTurns withFatness:(int)varFatness
{
    varTurns--;

    if (varTurns &lt;= 0) {
    	varFatness = varFatness - 5;
    }
    else {
    	varFatness += 2;
    }

    return [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:[NSNumber numberWithInt:varFatness], @""FATNESS"", [NSNumber numberWithInt:varTurns], @""TURNS"", nil];

}
</code></pre>

<p>However, this code doesn't work, and I need some more information to really understand it.  Let's assuming I'm passing it these values:</p>

<pre><code>int varMoney;
int varNumSheep;
int varNumShepherds;
NSString *test1;
NSString *test2;
</code></pre>

<p>So I need to get all of these values back from the method.</p>

<p>How do I declare this in the header file?  This should be in an Objective-C file, but could you give me the code for the entire file so I can see where it would go with the <code>@implementation</code> and <code>@end</code>, whatnot.  Also, how would I call this method?</p>
","115730","","<p>What about passing in the values as pointers?</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>- (void) getValuesForInt:(int *)int1 anotherInt:(int *)int2 aBool:(BOOL *)bool1 anotherBool:(BOOL *)bool2 {
  if (*int1 == 42 &amp;&amp; *int2 == 0) {
    *int1 = 0;
    *int2 = 42;
  }
  if (*bool1 == NO) {
    *bool2 = YES;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can invoke it like:</p>

<pre><code>int int1 = 42;
int int2 = 0;
BOOL bool1 = NO;
BOOL bool2 = NO;
[self getValuesForInt:&amp;int1 anotherInt:&amp;int2 aBool:&amp;bool1 anotherBool:&amp;bool2];
NSLog(@""int1: %d int2: %d bool1: %d bool2: %d"", int1, int2, bool1, bool2);
//prints ""int1: 0 int2: 42 bool1: 0 bool2: 1""
</code></pre>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>This works equally well with objects.  You'll often see this used when dealing with <code>NSError</code> objects:</p>

<pre><code>NSError *error = nil;
[anObject doSomething:foo error:&amp;error];
</code></pre>

<p>Can be implemented as:</p>

<pre><code>- (void) doSomething:(id)terrible error:(NSError **)error {
  if ([terrible isEqual:reallyBad]) {
    if (error != nil) { *error = [NSError errorWithDomain:@""domain"" code:42 userInfo:nil]; }
  }

"<p>I'm creating an app that has a master-detail interface, similar to iTunes.  It has the same data hierarchy as iTunes' playlists (except that I'm not allowing groups of ""playlists"" to keep things simple).  In other words, there are normal playlists where their only items are added manually by the user.  There are smart playlists, which show all items that match a user-defined predicate.  Finally, there are some ""playlists"" that are not editable at all by the user (I call these <code>DefaultFolders</code>), but are in essence nothing more than fancy smart playlists in that their predicate is to show everything.  These are like the ""Library"" and ""Movies"" sections in iTunes.</p>

<p>In my attempt to recreate this structure, I've come up with the following hierarchy (in Core Data): <a href=""http://gallery.me.com/davedelong#100084/Screen%20shot%202009-11-07%20at%207.17.53%20PM&amp;bgcolor=black"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gallery.me.com/davedelong#100084/Screen%20shot%202009-11-07%20at%207.17.53%20PM&amp;bgcolor=black</a> (hopefully it is self-explanatory)</p>

<p>However, as I've gotten further into this app, this structure has become a little cumbersome.  For example, I defined an accessor on the AbstractFolder class called <code>-(NSSet *)items</code>, so that all concrete folder types (<code>DefaultFolder</code>, <code>SmartFolder</code>, and <code>Folder</code>) can easily retrieve their contents.  This coincides with the relationship that the Folder entity has with the <code>Item</code> entity.  However, I can't implement the <code>items</code> accessor in <code>AbstractFolder</code>, because that would override the generated accessor provided by Core Data for the <code>Folder</code> entity.  I've thought about making it part of a protocol that all concrete folders would implement, but that seems to defeat the purpose of inheritance.</p>

<p>So I open this up to the collective wisdom of the mailing list.  Is there a better way I could model this structure?  Have any of you worked on apps with similar structures?  What did you find helpful?</p>

"<p>When would the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy%5Fpattern"">Strategy Pattern</a> be used?</p>

<p>I see client code snippets like this:</p>

<pre>
<code>
class StrategyExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Context context;

        // Three contexts following different strategies
        context = new Context(new ConcreteStrategyAdd());
        int resultA = context.executeStrategy(3,4);

        context = new Context(new ConcreteStrategySubtract());
        int resultB = context.executeStrategy(3,4);

        context = new Context(new ConcreteStrategyMultiply());
        int resultC = context.executeStrategy(3,4);

    }

}
</code>
</pre>

<p>and it looks like you could just refactor it to this:</p>

<pre>
<code>
class StrategyExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
         // Three contexts following different strategies
        int resultA =new ConcreteStrategyAdd().execute(3,4);
        int resultB =new ConcreteStrategySubtract().execute(3,4);
        int resultC =new ConcreteStrategyMultiply().execute(3,4);
    }

}
</code>
</pre>

<p>The first section of code was taken directly from the wikipedia page.  One big difference is the context goes away, but it wasn't doing anything in the example anyway.  Maybe someone has a better example where Strategy makes sense.  I usually like design patterns but this one seems to add complexity without adding usefulness.</p>
","115730","","<p>The Cocoa frameworks used on Mac and iPhone use the strategy pattern a <em>lot</em>, except that we call it the Delegate Pattern.  Here's how we use it:</p>

<p>We have a concrete object, say an <code>NSTableView</code>.  The table view needs to know how many rows it has, what goes in each row, each column etc.  So instead of subclassing the tableview to provide that information, we provide a ""delegate"" object.  That delegate object implements a certain interface (""protocol"" in Objective-C).  Then the tableview can simply ask its delegate object what it should do in certain situations (""how many rows do I have?""  ""What goes in this cell?""  ""Is the user allowed to select this row?"").  We can swap the delegate object at runtime simply by assigning a new object that conforms to the <code>NSTableViewDelegate</code> protocol.</p>

<p>So yeah, the strategy pattern is one of my favorites and one that I use every single day.</p>

"<p>When ever I set an image for a UIImageView in IB and simulate the interface the buttons and stuff show up but the image view doesn't.</p>
","115730","","<p>That's because the simulator used by Interface Builder is independent of your project.  It's just taking your xib files, building the interface, and displaying it.  As such, any resources it finds references to but can't find will be skipped.  So if your <code>UIImageView</code> uses an image named ""myImage.png"", then when the simulator runs, it's going to try to execute <code>[UIImage imageNamed:@""myImage.png""];</code>.  Since ""myImage.png"" is not part of the Simulator bundle, it will fail to create the image, and your UIImageView will be blank.</p>

<p>It can create buttons because (obviously) buttons are standard, globally available code.  Your project-specific resources are not.</p>

"<p>Sorry if my question if a dumb one, but I couldn't find a way to solve it. The thing is a have a custom text view that sometimes need to wrap text according to its own rules. Everything works just fine with static content, but if I insert a @""\n"" as the user starts to write another word (I know the word he's going to type and I know it won't fit anyway), iPhone keyboard automatically toggles shift on, which drives the user mad as he didn't intend to capitalize the word. It's mission critical for me to have those wraps working, so I either need a way to end line in another way or toggle shift on keyboard back.</p>

<p>Or, in two words: how can I toggle keyboard's shift off programmatically? </p>

<p>Anybody?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong> Guys, a small question around the keyboard on iPhone. AFAIK we can get keyboard's object (by fetching UIKeyboardImpl class and calling +sharedInstance on it) and obviously do some things around it. However, I also heard that Apple is very concerned around such hack, so I'm curious if they could reject the app if I fix the issue using such approach? Obviously, I'm not going to change kayboard outlook, and even logic remains the same (at least from human's point of view), but is this enough to not get ass-kicked?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2</strong> For now I managed to achieve the desired behavior by turning autocap off and setting shift state manually. Is there a better solution?</p>
","115730","","<p>There is no way to toggle the shift manually on the keyboard (at least not without using some undiscovered private API), but you can control the Autocapitalization behavior of the textfield by saying <code>[myTextField setAutocapitalizationType:UITextAutocapitalizationTypeNone];</code></p>

<p>An explanation of the regex:  <code>(.*)</code> This will match as many characters as it can, until it finds a space character.  However, the capture is greedy, which means it's going to grab as many characters as it can before the last space character (in a nutshell).</p>

<p>Or you can use <code>NSString</code> methods to find the last occurrence of the space character and get a substring from the beginning of the line to the last space character.</p>

<p>Or you can split the string base on <code>@"" ""</code>, throw away the last object in the array, and then recombine the array with <code>@"" ""</code>.</p>

"<p>I'm writing a program that processes hundreds of files when run.  Right now each file and folder is stored in an object I created (it contains the filepath, filetype, filesize, a pointer to an offset in the file, and if it is a directory), and those objects are placed in a NSMutableArray.  A big problem with this is at the end of processing all the files, I need to get statistics for all the files in each folder.

<p>My question is this:  Is there a more efficient way to store a list of files and folders in cocoa (other than NSMutableArray, sets, etc) so I can quickly access all folders and all objects inside those folders?  Is there some structure that will create an array of folders and and array of files and folders located in that parent folder?</p>
","115730","","<p>You might also want to consider a tree-like structure.  You have a root node that corresponds to the filepath ""/"".  Then root has many children, each for ""/System"", ""/etc"", ""/Library"", ""/Users"", etc.</p>

<p>When you add a node into this tree, you can have it percolate up and add the filesize of the new node to the parents (so that the tree will always have the correct volume size in the root node).  Or you can have it compute the size as you need (recursively, most likely) and return that.</p>

"<p>I'm getting close to finishing my first relatively simple Xcode project (a custom installer) and I need to do 22 builds. Yes that wasn't a typo!

<p>From what I've read so far, duplicating the existing target seems to be the way to do it when there are only a couple of builds but is that still true for 22? It seems like an awful lot of work.

","115730","","<p>One way that I've accomplished this in the past is to use Localization.  When you use the <code>NSLocalizedString</code> flavored macros, some of them have the ability to specify a tableName (ie, a different strings file than the default).  Then whenever I need a differently branded build, I just create a new .strings file with the appropriate key-value pairs.</p>

<p>I then have a build target that builds the code with the default values, and a second target that takes the built code and copies the appropriate .strings file into its proper location.  This works pretty well and has allowed us to manage many different build flavors.</p>

<p>The systems default call for getting the SYSTEM temp folder should return the folder we have specified. On MS-Windows this is GetTempPath(). On MacOS the function is called NSTemporaryDirectory() I think.</p>

<p>We need to do this because we are running multiple instances of our application at the same time. There are some 3rd party libs which are using non-unique temporary filenames stored in the SYSTEMs temp folder.</p>

<p>For Microsoft Windows and for Unix platforms we already have a solution:</p>

<pre><code>   Microsoft Windows:

        setenv(""TMP"", myOwnTempFolder);
        tmpFolderToUse=GetTempPath(); // use WinOS API call


   Unix:

         setenv(""TMPDIR"", myOwnTempFolder);
         tmpFolderToUse = getenv(""TMPDIR"");
</code></pre>

<p>but this doesn't work for MacOS(X).</p>

<pre><code>   MacOS:

         setenv(""TMPDIR"", myOwnTempFolder);
         tmpFolderToUse = NSTemporaryDirectory(); // use MacOS API call
</code></pre>

<p>The call to NSTemporaryDirectory() always returns the default path afterwards (as without setting a different folder).</p>

<p>I have tried to invoke setenv(""..."") with TMPDIR, TEMP, TEMPDIR, and TMP - but no luck on MacOSX.</p>

<p>For clarification: here a multiple instance pseudo-code example as it currently implemented for the Windows OS flavor of our application:</p>

<p>instance1:</p>

<pre><code>tmp=GetTempPath(); // -&gt; 'C:\User\testing\temp'
uuid=getUUID(); // -&gt; 'd7c5df40-d48d-11de-8a39-0800200c9a66'
setenv(""TMP"", tmp + uuid);
tmp=GetTempPath(); // --&gt; 'C:\User\testing\temp\d7c5df40-d48d-11de-8a39-0800200c9a66'
</code></pre>

<p>instance2:</p>

<pre><code>tmp=GetTempPath(); // -&gt; 'C:\User\testing\temp'
uuid=getUUID(); // -&gt; '435aeb10-d48e-11de-8a39-0800200c9a66'
setenv(""TMP"", tmp + uuid);
tmp=GetTempPath(); // --&gt; 'C:\User\testing\temp\435aeb10-d48e-11de-8a39-0800200c9a66'

<p>I am writing a parser using the dynamic creation pattern. (See the book Cocoa Design Patterns by Buck and Yacktman, chapter 5.) Basically, the parser instance processes a stack, and instantiates objects that know how to perform certain calculations.</p>

<p>If I can get all the subclasses of the <code>MYCommand</code> class, I can, for example, provide the user with a list of available commands. Also, in the example from chapter 5, the parser has an substitution dictionary so operators like +, -, * and / can be used. (They are mapped to <code>MYAddCommand</code>, etc.) To me it seemed this information belonged in the <code>MyCommand</code> subclass, not the parser instance as it kinda defeats the idea of dynamic creation.</p>

"<h2>Background</h2>

<p>I am creating a Source List for my application and I want it structured in a way similar to that of iTunes, with two types of items:</p>

<ul>
<li>""Fixed"" items – these do not change and can't be moved around – at the top</li>
<li>Editable items underneath, which <em>can</em> be changed by the user – moved around, renamed etc (in the iTunes example, like Playlists and Smart Playlists)</li>
</ul>

<p>In my iTunes analogy:</p>

<p><img src=""http://perspx.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/itunessourcelist.jpg"" alt=""iTunes Source List""></p>

<p>The way I've structured my data so far is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>The items which I want to be editable are ""group"" items, in the form of <code>Group</code> Core Data entities.</li>
<li>Each item in the Source List is represented as a <code>SourceListItem</code> regular Objective-C object so that I can associate each item with a title, icon, child items etc</li>
<li>The fixed items are currently represented by <code>SourceListItem</code> instances, stored in an array in my controller object.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Question</h2>

<p>I am unsure of how to amalgamate these two types of item into the Source List, so that the fixed items are at the top and always there and do not change, and the editable items are at the bottom and can be moved around and edited.</p>

<p>These are the ideas I've come up with so far:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Add the fixed items to the Core Data model.</strong> This means that I can create an entity to represent Source List items and have my fixed and editable items placed in instances of these. Then these can be bound to the Outline View table column with an Array/Tree Controller. However, this means that I'd have to create a new entity to represent the Source List items, and then sync the <code>Group</code>s with this. I'd also have to have some way of creating all the fixed items only once, and if something happened to any of the persistent store files then the fixed items would not be displayed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Merge the fixed items with the group items.</strong> Whilst both are stored in separate arrays, this could be done in the controller for my window when the Outline View requests the data (if adopting the <code>NSOutlineViewDataSource</code> protocol, not bindings). However this means that I'd have to create new <code>SourceListItem</code>s for each group in the array controller (to associate each with icons and other attributes), store these and then watch the group array controller for changes to remove, add or modify the <code>SourceListItem</code> instances when changes are made to the groups.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Does anyone have any better ideas on how I can implement this?</p>

<p>I would like my application to be compatible with OS X v10.5 so I'd prefer any solutions that <strong>didn't</strong> depend on having Snow Leopard installed.</p>
","115730","","<p>I'm working on an app that has this exact same behavior, and here's how I'm doing it:</p>

<p>I have 5 main entities in my Core Data Model:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>AbstractItem</code> - an abstract Entity that has the attributes common to all items, like <code>name</code>, <code>weight</code>, and <code>editable</code>. Also has two relationships: <code>parent</code> (to-one relationship to <code>AbstractItem</code>) and <code>children</code> (to-many relationship to <code>AbstractItem</code>, and the inverse of <code>parent</code>).</li>
<li><code>Group</code> - concrete child Entity of <code>AbstractItem</code>.</li>
<li><code>Folder</code> - concrete child Entity of <code>AbstractItem</code>. Adds a many-to-many relationship to the basic <code>Item</code> entity.</li>
<li><code>SmartFolder</code> - concrete child Entity of <code>Folder</code>. Adds a binary attribute <code>predicateData</code>. Overrides <code>Folder</code>'s ""items"" relationship accessor to return the results of executing a fetch request with the predicate defined by the <code>predicateData</code> attribute.</li>
<li><code>DefaultFolder</code> - concrete child Entity of <code>SmartFolder</code>. Adds a string attribute <code>identifier</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>For the ""Library"" section items, I insert <code>DefaultFolder</code> objects and give them a unique identifier so I can retrieve them easily and differentiate between them.  I also give them an <code>NSPredicate</code> that corresponds to what <code>Items</code> they're supposed to show.  For example, the ""Music"" <code>DefaultFolder</code> would have a predicate to retrieve all Music items, the ""Podcasts"" <code>DefaultFolder</code> would have a predicate to retrieve all Podcast items, etc.</p>

<p>The root-level items (""Library"", ""Shared"", ""Store"", ""Genius"", etc) are all <code>Group</code> items with a <code>nil</code> parent.  The groups and Folders that cannot be edited have their <code>editable</code> attribute set to <code>NO</code>.</p>

<p>As for actually getting this stuff in your outlineView, you'll have to implement the <code>NSOutlineViewDataSource</code> and <code>NSOutlineViewDelegate</code> protocols yourself.  There's just too much behavioral complexity here to pump it out through an <code>NSTreeController</code>.  However, in my app, I got all of the behavior in (even drag-and-drop) in under 200 lines of code (so it's not <em>that</em> bad).</p>

"<p>I was wondering how it can be that iterating through an NSMutableArray works, but when I call objectAtIndex it fails with ""*** -[NSCFSet objectAtIndex:]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x...""</p>

<p>Here is some sample code, the program is too big to share in whole so I hope it's enough. The code is executed in the latest iPhone Simulator from XCode. </p>

 //This works  
 for(CPConversation * x in appDelegate.distribution.conversations){
  RDLogString(@""Pointer: %p with name %@"", x, x.name);
 }  
 //This fails with aforementioned error  
 CPConversation * conversationAtCurrentIndex = [appDelegate.distribution.conversations objectAtIndex: indexPath.row];
</code></pre>

<p>Thanks in advance,
Nick</p>
","115730","","<p><code>objectAtIndex:</code> is part of <code>NSArray</code>, not <code>NSSet</code>.  This means your <code>appDelegate.distribution.conversations</code> is returning an <code>NSSet</code> and  you need an <code>NSArray</code>.</p>

"<p>I have an app with a button 'convert'. When I click this button, the app starts a new process using NSTask and then greys out the button until the process finishes.</p>

<p>How do I ignore any user input while waiting for this task to finish?</p>
","115730","","<p><code>-[NSTask waitUntilExit]</code> is, of course, a blocking call.  That means the thread pauses (as does the run loop) and all the events that are sent to the thread are queued up until the run loop can process them.</p>

- (void) taskFinished:(NSNotification *)note {
  [myButton setEnabled:YES];
}

<p>This will launch your task, disable the button, but not block the thread, because you're not waiting for it to finish.  Instead, you're waiting for the asynchronous notification of whenever the task finishes.  Since the button is disabled until the task finishes, this will ignore all events sent to it.</p>

NSString *formattedDateStr = [formatter stringFromDate:date];

return formattedDateStr;
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>That outputs just fine, but it isnt letting me group books with the same copyright month day and year in the same section because again (I am assuming) the date value has the time as well. The actual saving of the date value from the datepicker is done in the EditingViewController.m file as follows:</p>

<pre><code> - (IBAction)save {

// Pass current value to the edited object, then pop.
if (editingDate) {
    [editedObject setValue:datePicker.date forKey:editedFieldKey];
}
</code></pre>

<p>The save method currently takes the date as-is from the datepicker, so how do I modify that code to first copy the datepicker's date to a local variable and blank out the time in there and then use that value in the setValue statement so it groups correctly? PLEASE HELP! Thanks</p>
","115730","","<p>Since date's inherently include time, you're going to have to modify the <code>NSDate</code> object itself by converting it into its <code>NSDateComponent</code>s, blanking out the <code>HH:mm:ss</code>, and then converting those date components back into an NSDate.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>NSDate * aDate = [NSDate date];
NSDateComponents * components = [[NSCalendar currentCalendar] components:(NSYearCalendarUnit | NSMonthCalendarUnit | NSDayCalendarUnit) fromDate:aDate];
NSDate * convertedDate = [[NSCalendar currentCalendar] dateFromComponents:components];
</code></pre>

<p>If you do this, you'll lose things like timezone offset, so you might want to consider the side effects of that.</p>

<p>The nice thing about this method is that it works regardless of how the string is formatted (which is a fragile thing to rely on).</p>

"<p>I see there are a lot of questions about this, but nothing helped me to get this work.
I have a nib with a NSTableView with three columns (with the right identifiers set) and a class named ShortcutsTableController. In the nib I have a NSObject with class value ShortcutsTableController. I also connected the NSTableView to my controller as I usually do.</p>

<p>This is header <code>ShortcutsTableController.h</code>.</p>

<pre><code>#import &lt;Cocoa/Cocoa.h&gt;


@interface ShortcutsTableController : NSObject &lt;NSTableViewDataSource&gt; {
    IBOutlet NSTableView *shortcutsTable;
    NSMutableArray *shortcutsList;
}

- (int) numberOfRowsInTableView: (NSTableView*) tableView;
- (id)tableView:(NSTableView *)tableView objectValueForTableColumn:(NSTableColumn *)tableColumn row:(int)row;

@property (assign) IBOutlet NSTableView *shortcutsTable;
- (void)setUpTable;

@end
</code></pre>

<p>And this is the implementation file <code>ShortcutsTableController.m</code>.</p>

<pre><code>#import ""ShortcutsTableController.h""

@implementation ShortcutsTableController

@synthesize shortcutsTable;

- (void)setUpTable {

    shortcutsList = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init];

    NSDictionary *dict1 = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:
                           @""blabla"", @""nameColumn"", 
                           @""Bla bla bla"", @""shortcutColumn"",
                           @""Ribla"", @""actionColumn"", nil];

    [shortcutsList addObject:dict1];

    [shortcutsTable setDataSource:self];
    [shortcutsTable reloadData];
}

-(int) numberOfRowsInTableView: (NSTableView *) tableView {
    return [shortcutsList count];
}

- (id)tableView:(NSTableView *)tableView objectValueForTableColumn:(NSTableColumn *)tableColumn row:(int)row {

    if (row != -1)
    	return [[shortcutsList objectAtIndex:row] objectForKey:[tableColumn identifier]];

    return nil;
}

@end
</code></pre>

<p>But when i try to build nothing appears in the NSTableView. No errors, no warnings. Note that I call setUpTable from within the Delegate Class Method <code>awakeFromNib</code>.</p>

<p>Is there something I am doing wrong? Thank you for you help.</p>

<p>—Albé</p>

<p>UPDATE. Added lines <code>@property (assign) IBOutlet NSTableView *shortcutsTable;</code> in header and <code>@synthesize shortcutsTable;</code> in implementation. Nothing changes. :(</p>
","115730","","<p>Based on the results of your <code>NSLog</code> statement in <code>setUpTable:</code>, you don't have your IBOutlet set up.  Perhaps you did, but it somehow got lost (undo, overwrite, accidentally deleted it, etc).  You'll need to go back to Interface Builder and re-establish the connection between <code>ShortcutsTableController</code> and the <code>NSTableView</code> in the xib.</p>

"<p>I'm currently writing an iPhone application which gets some data from the user and uploads it to a server. The uploaded data will be displayed to other users of the same program (there's more to it than that, but to keep the idea simple...). The data which is uploaded is basically just three strings: a name(max. 50 char.), a title(max. 50 char.) and some text(virtually unlimited char.). What I need is basically a function, service or algorithm which can detect how valid the data input is. It would have to be able to detect series of repetitive characters, certain 'illegal' words, abnormal whitespaces, etc. So my questions is; is there a C or Objective-C library (build-in or open source) for this sort of data validation, or else, how would I go about doing this kind of check?</p>

<p>Here are two examples of good and bad data:</p>

<p>GOOD:   </p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>Name: ""John Aaron Smith""  
Title: ""Why am I still here?""  
Text: ""Can anybody please help me? I'm feeling lonely!""
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>BAD:  </p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>Name: ""f**k you, kldsanfklds""   
Title: ""Only $99. Buy Now. Only $99""  
Text: ""ndsaklgnvds lakævndsaklæfhadsæhdsjka fhdskjafhdskj lafhsdkhf. €#&amp;/ #&amp;()(/&amp;%&amp; &gt;# €%€#% €#&amp; hidosæahviædshvidshfiodsa. adsifjDSILFJIDSH \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n""
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>I know taking precautions for so many cases will be difficult, but this algorithm/library would just have to filter the worst spam. I will also be looking through the data before the final database submission, but of course the less spam, the easier I'll have it.</p>

<p>Yours, 
BEN.</p>

<p>EDIT: My most 'fluent' language is objective-C, but I'm also doing pretty well with C, and I have knowledge of PHP and JAVA. Libraries/examples in other languages might be difficult for me to understand, and 'translate' into a valid iPhone language.</p>

<p>EDIT-EDIT: I'm not looking for something overly sophisticated. Just a simple way for me to do the rough cut.</p>

<p>The strange thing is I have count:5, yet I'm getting many more results. </p>

<p>For the actual parsing, would I save the output to an NSArray, and then an NSDictionary, which I can query with valueForKey:@""text"" for example?</p>

<p>I know two delegate methods are being called too (requestSucceeded: and searchResultsReceived:forRequest: ) but I'm not sure how this affects parsing. </p>

<p>The actual delegate method for searchResultsReceived:forRequest: is:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)searchResultsReceived:(NSArray *)searchResults forRequest:(NSString *)connectionIdentifier
{
 NSLog(@""Got search results for %@:\r%@"", connectionIdentifier, searchResults);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This suggests that the results are actually stored by variable searchResults. </p>

<p>Still, how do I get the individual strings?</p>

<p>Thanks for the help!</p>
","115730","","<p>I'm not sure what parsing you need to do.  You're supposed to be supplying a delegate to the engine (like a callback, but an actual object), which the engine will use to notify you when it has results.  The results should be coming back as an <code>NSArray</code> of <code>NSDictionary</code>s, which means you don't have to do any parsing at all.</p>
"
"<p>What are the data structures that we can use in Objective-C?</p>
","115730","","<p><code>NSArray</code> is your standard array structure.</p>

<p><code>NSDictionary</code> is a key-value ""hash map""</p>

"<p>I am trying to perform a simple operation that i have done alot in this program. I am trying to launch the CLLocationManager once the app is finished launching and get the current location once the update has happened. My app works in that it get the current location, when i NSLog the current location it works fine. The problem is that i am trying to pass this location from one object to another and it does not have a value once it gets there.</p>

<p>I have been looking up accessor methods and everything seems right as i have these types of operations all over my program. I have tried to follow numerous examples but none seem to work. </p>

<p>Here is some code.</p>

<p>This is the .h file of the CLLocationManagerDelegate.  </p>

<pre><code>@interface YogaAllianceAppDelegate : NSObject &lt;UIApplicationDelegate,CLLocationManagerDelegate&gt; {

CLLocationManager *locationManager;
    CLLocation *mycurrentLocation;

    float curLats;
    float curLons;
    BOOL locationDidUpdate;

    UIWindow *window;

    YogaAllianceViewController *viewController;
}

@property (nonatomic, retain) IBOutlet UIWindow *window;  
@property (nonatomic, retain) CLLocationManager *locationManager;
@property (nonatomic, assign) float curLats;
@property (nonatomic, assign) float curLons;
@property (nonatomic, assign) CLLocation *mycurrentLocation;
@property (nonatomic, retain) IBOutlet YogaAllianceViewController *viewController;
@end
</code></pre>

<p>This is the .m file</p>

<pre><code>@synthesize viewController, locationManager, curLats, curLons, mycurrentLocation;





- (void)applicationDidFinishLaunching:(UIApplication *)application {    

    self.locationManager = [[[CLLocationManager alloc]init] autorelease];
    locationManager.desiredAccuracy = kCLLocationAccuracyBest;
    locationManager.delegate = self;
    [locationManager startUpdatingLocation];


    locationDidUpdate = NO;
    [window addSubview:viewController.view];
    [window makeKeyAndVisible];

}


-(void)locationManager: (CLLocationManager *)manager
   didUpdateToLocation: (CLLocation *)newLocation
    	  fromLocation: (CLLocation *)oldLocation{

    [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter]
     postNotificationName:@""currentLocationDidUpdate"" object: self];

    [locationManager stopUpdatingLocation];



    NSLog(@""Core Location says location available"");


    self.curLats = newLocation.coordinate.latitude;
    self.curLons = newLocation.coordinate.longitude;

    self.mycurrentLocation  = newLocation;


    NSLog(@""current position is then %@"", [mycurrentLocation description]);

}
</code></pre>

<p>At this point it works. I get the location printed out and everything, but i need that location in another object and it seems that all my attempts at reworking the dot notation has failed.
Here is the . h of the object i need it in.</p>

<pre><code>@interface School_Location_List_Controller : UIViewController {


    CLLocation* currentLocation;	

}

- (IBAction) btnBack_Clicked:(id)sender;

    currentLocation = updated.mycurrentLocation ;



    NSLog(@""current position here in the passed object is %@"", [currentLocation description]);

"<p>To explain what I'm trying to do: </p>

<p>This view is showing content for a specific day. Lets call the view controller OneDayViewController. I will have on the view buttons ""earlier"" and ""later"" in a single cell in a group of this table view. in another group I will have rows of content in cells; clicking one pushes onto the navigationController a viewContoller for this content item.

where you use UIViewAnimationTransitionFlipFromRight etc to run an animation when switching views.
I think with this approach I would be pushing onto the navcontroller first a UIViewController subclass containing two TableViewController subclasses that I switch between.
But what about the NavBar of the NavController? how would that be affected by the pageflip? And really I'm interested in having the view slide, like when the view is pushed on the navcontroller stack. Except I would want the ""previous"" button to start the new view in from the left. Or maybe this approach would be troubling to the Interface Guideline police....</p>

"<p>I am communicating with a webservice to retrieve a numerical value that comes into my function as an NSString.  This number tells me the precise amount of time to wait until I perform another action, and it is critical that it be precise.  </p>

"<p>I have already created a project to read a file and also to display it. Now i need to create a hashtable and access the data from the created file( text file ) in Objective-C for iPhone-OS. Pls do give suggestion...</p>
","115730","","<p>Your question does not make sense.</p>

<p>A hash-table (I think you're referring to what we call an <code>NSDictionary</code>, or a set of key-value pairs) is a data structure.</p>

<p>A file is a series of bytes that can be interpreted in a multitude of ways.  It can be interpreted as audio, video, or textual data.  It can be interpreted as something entirely different.</p>

<p>So you want to ""create a hashtable"".  That's easy enough:</p>

<pre><code>NSDictionary * myDictionary = [[NSDictionary alloc] init];
</code></pre>

<p>And you want to access the data from the created file:</p>

<pre><code>NSString * fileContents = [[NSString alloc] initWithContentsOfFile:pathToFile encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding error:nil];
//or
NSFileHandle * fileHandle = [NSFileHandle fileHandleForReadingAtPath:pathToFile];
</code></pre>

<p>What you do beyond that is unspecified in your question.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>You want to know how to access the file contents ""automatically"".  Well, using the NSString method above, you can parse it yourself.  Using the NSFileHandle method you can read in the bytes yourself.  The only way to get a file to automatically convert into an NSDictionary is to use <code>-[NSDictionary initWithContentsOfFile:]</code>.  However, in order to use that, you have to have previously used <code>-[NSDictionary writeToFile:atomically:]</code> to create the file.</p>

<p>John Doner  </p>
","115730","","<p>This shows up as a warning because Objective-C is a very dynamic language.  At compile time, the compiler hasn't found the declaration for ""myMethod"" (perhaps you're missing a header file, or forgot to include it in the header?) when it was attempting to compile the file.

<p>Since you're getting an ""unrecognized selector"" error, that means the runtime doesn't know about your category, which means it wasn't linked into your binary.  I would check and make sure your category's .m file is included in the appropriate target, clean, and build again.</p>

<p>EDIT: for example, <a href=""http://it.toolbox.com/blogs/macsploitation/extending-classes-in-objectivec-with-categories-27447"">this blog post</a> shows how to create a category for <code>NSArray</code> for creating a shuffled copy of the original array.</p>

<p>EDIT #2: Apple's documentation on categories uses the specific example of extending the functionality of <code>NSArray</code>, so I find it difficult to believe that the ""recommended"" approach would be to wrap the array in a helper object.  <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjectiveC/Articles/ocCategories.html#//apple%5Fref/doc/uid/TP30001163-CH20-SW1"">Citation (search the page for the five ""NSArray"" references)</a></p>

"<p>I attended an iphone bootcamp in early '08 and have TA'd a few since. I've recently been asked to teach one and I'm curious what YOU would want to be covered. </p>

<p>Keep in mind, the class is 3x days (8 hours each day, minus 1hour for lunch)</p>

<p>My <em>WIP</em> list currently is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Introduction to the iphone hardware</li>
<li>' ' ' development environment</li>
<li>Debugging walkthrough/exercise</li>
<li>Core OS, Core Services, Media, Cocoa Touch.</li>
<li>Obj-C/OOP programming (Basics)</li>
<li>(Common) Foundation Classes -NSArray, Set, Number, Dictionary, etc.</li>
<li>Combine both Obj-c/OOP &amp; common classes exercise</li>
<li>Introduction to IB</li>
<li>IB Exercise / Hello World </li>
<li>Introduction to Controllers</li>
<li>' ' Views, SubViews</li>
<li>' ' TableView</li>
<li>TableView exercises</li>
<li>TabView</li>
<li>Memory Management / Pointers</li>
</ul>

<p>Once a solid foundation is provided, we could cover (Some, probably not all):</p>

<ul>
<li>accelerometer</li>
<li>sound </li>
<li>core location </li>
<li>nscoder/nsuserdefaults</li>
<li>animation </li>
<li>networking</li>
<li>camera </li>
<li>touch events </li>
<li>advanced debugging </li>
<li>tools (shark, clang, etc).</li>
</ul>

<p>Things like openGL, as cool as they are, might be too much to cover.</p>

<p>Maybe we should cover submitting an application, developer certs and such.</p>

","115730","","<p>You can't.  A <code>BOOL</code> is either <code>YES</code> or <code>NO</code>.  There is no other state.  The way around this would be to use an <code>NSNumber</code> (<code>[NSNumber numberWithBool:YES];</code>), and then check to see if the <code>NSNumber</code> itself is <code>nil</code>.  Or have a second <code>BOOL</code> to indicate if you've altered the value of the first.</p>

But <code>floatValue</code> is usually adequate for most purposes.</p>

"<p>This is definitely obsessive, but I am fascinated  by how cleverly the compiler translates C code into machine instructions.  Since I am a little fuzzy on some instructions, it would be helpful if I could watch the operation of a compiled program at the level of individual machine instructions - ""below"" the level of a C statement (which might generate several CPU instructions).  In other words, can I watch the registers/memory change after a single machine instruction?</p>

"<p>I develop <a href=""http://cocoaheads.byu.edu/code/CHDataStructures"" rel=""nofollow"">CHDataStructures</a>, a library of Cocoa data structures to supplement those in Foundation. It includes <a href=""http://dysart.cs.byu.edu/CHDataStructures/inherits.html"" rel=""nofollow"">a fair number of classes</a> (stacks, queues, and dequeues) that share common implementation details, so it makes sense to design them with a common parent class which I treat as abstract (Objective-C doesn't natively enforce this concept). For example, <a href=""http://dysart.cs.byu.edu/CHDataStructures/interface_c_h_abstract_circular_buffer_collection.html"" rel=""nofollow"">CHAbstractCircularBufferCollection</a> encapsulates nearly all the logic for structures that utilize a circular buffer under the covers. Its child classes inherit the core behaviors, and conform to the appropriate protocol so only the methods that pertain to that protocol are added. (So a queue doesn't expose stack methods, etc.)</p>

<p>This has been working just fine, and correctness and coverage are <a href=""http://dysart.cs.byu.edu/CHDataStructures/coverage/source/"" rel=""nofollow"">verifiable via unit tests</a>. However, the downside to the current approach is that each concrete subclass has a <code>#import</code> to include the header for the abstract parent class (see <a href=""http://dysart.cs.byu.edu/chsvn/CHDataStructures/source/CHCircularBufferQueue.h"" rel=""nofollow"">this header</a> and <a href=""http://dysart.cs.byu.edu/chsvn/CHDataStructures/source/CHCircularBufferQueue.m"" rel=""nofollow"">implementation</a>) — this means I have to export the parent class headers so client code will compile. It would be ideal if there is a way to use <code>@class</code> in the header rather than <code>#import</code>, so that calling code doesn't have to know or care about the abstract parent class. (It would also simplify and marginally shrink the size of the framework.) However, when I try this:</p>

#import ""CHQueue.h""
@class CHAbstractCircularBufferCollection;

</blockquote>

<p>I want the compiler to know about the parent class I'm extending, but not require clients to. Is there a way to accomplish what I want to do, and eliminate irrelevant headers from my distribution?</p>

<p>PS - This framework arose mostly from academic curiosity, but I'm considering making changes to make it more like Foundation collections by using class clusters and private subclasses. That would also solve this problem, but I'm curious whether there is a feasible way to do what I'm asking.</p>

<p>For the <code>NSNumber</code>, the ivar is: <code>NSNumber * isTrue;</code> and the property is <code>@property (nonatomic, retain) NSNumber * isTrue;</code>.  If you go with this route, you might want to provide a second setter method (<code>setIsTrueBool</code> or something) that allows you to just pass in <code>YES</code> or <code>NO</code>, and then you do the boxing yourself.  Otherwise anyone who calls this would have to do the boxing themselves.</p>

","115730","","<p>I had need of something like this recently.  I wanted to break up a selector string (ex: <code>initWithFoo:bar:baz:</code>) into its various components: (ex: <code>initWithFoo:</code>, <code>bar:</code>, and <code>baz:</code>).  You've found, as did I, that <code>componentsSeparatedByString:</code> doesn't quite cut it.  I therefore created an <code>NSString</code> category to do what I was looking for:</p>

<pre><code>- (NSArray *) selectorComponents {
    NSMutableArray * components = [NSMutableArray array];
    NSMutableString * scratchString = [self mutableCopy];
    while ([scratchString rangeOfString:@"":""].location != NSNotFound) {
        NSRange componentRange = NSMakeRange(0, [scratchString rangeOfString:@"":""].location+1);
        NSString * component = [scratchString substringWithRange:componentRange];
        [components addObject:component];
        [scratchString replaceCharactersInRange:componentRange withString:@""""];
    }
    [scratchString release];
    return components;
}
</code></pre>

<p>You'll want to change from searching for <code>@"":""</code> to <code>@""-""</code>, but after that it should work as you're expecting.</p>

"<p>Is there something similar to a circular linked list available in Cocoa?  </p>

<p>I know that an NSArray is ordered - but I don't think I can use 'nextItem' or 'previousItem' - correct?  Furthermore, I need the nextItem of the last item to be the first item.</p>

","115730","","<p>If you have an <code>NSDate</code>, you can use the current <code>NSCalendar</code> to retrieve that date's <code>NSDateComponents</code>.  Set the <code>NSDateComponents</code>'s <code>weekday</code> to 1 (the first day of the week), create a copy, and set the copy's <code>weekday</code> to 7 (the last day of the week).  Then use the <code>NSCalendar</code> to convert both the <code>NSDateComponents</code> back to their respective <code>NSDate</code> objects, after which you can use an <code>NSDateFormatter</code> to create your string representation.</p>

"<p>Does anyone know of an Objective-C library that will easily allow developers to parse a SQL file? I am building an iPhone application that contains a SQLite database and I am attempting to come with a system to upgrade a user's writable database. After reading a lot of the questions and answers on this site it appears that the best way to perform both DDL and DML operations is to keep a list of SQL files that will perform the necessary database upgrades. So now that I've decided that I am going to read a SQL file in the application bundle and then execute the individual SQL statements I need a way to parse the actual file into executable statements. From what I have read, there does not seem to be an existing library that will read a file line by line let alone parse SQL specific content. Does anyone know of one?</p>

<p>My current plan is to read the entire file into an NSString using:</p>

<pre><code>NSString *fileContents = [NSString stringWithContentsOfFile:filePath 
                                                   encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding
                                                      error:&amp;error];
</code></pre>

<p>From there I am going to parse out the statements by splitting the string on the semicolon using <code>[NSScanner scanUpToString]</code> or <code>[NSString componentsSeparatedByString]</code>. I keep telling myself that there has to be a better way to do this because by using this crude method, I am going to lose the ability to include comments in the scripts. Any suggestions?</p>
","115730","","<p>You might be over complicating the problem.  Here's what I understood:</p>

<p>You have a sqlite database, and different versions of your schema.  You need to update the schema from whatever version it's at to the latest version.  Good so far?</p>

<p>You could use a file of SQL statements, in which case you can just read in your file, break the string up into statements (split on ; or \n or something), and then execute each statement yourself.  (You are <a href=""http://cocoaheads.byu.edu/resources/sqlite"" rel=""nofollow"">using a wrapper, right</a>?)</p>

<p>Or, you can perform the upgrade in code.  When I've done this in the past, I've added an extra table to my schema, and this table is basically a set of name-value pairs.  One of the pairs is the current version of the schema (like ""SCHEMA_VERSION"" => ""4"", or something).  Then, I have a method that basically does this:</p>

<pre><code>- (void) upgradeDatabase {
  int schema_version = [myDatabase retrieveSchemaVersion];
  switch(schema_version) {
    case 4:
      //upgrade to version 5
    case 5:
      //upgrade to version 6
    case 6:
      //upgrade to version 7
    case default:
      break;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, you could just use Core Data, which does basic schema migration for you.</p>

"<p>When i run unit tests it fails on loading external resources (images) with the same error as if they don't exist.  In xcode i have added the resources to the unit test target.  I don't know what to try next.</p>

","115730","","<p>Matt B.'s answer is technically correct, but I would say that for someone who is ""new to cocoa programming and objective-c"" that bindings might be too much magic to take in at first.

This pattern is <em>very frequently</em> used in the Cocoa frameworks, and to manually populate an <code>NSTableView</code> with objects, you'll need to understand it.</p>

<p>The basic idea is that the <code>NSTableView</code> knows how to draw, but not <em>what</em> to draw.  So what we do is we give the <code>NSTableView</code> a ""delegate"" object, and the tableview asks the delegate how many rows it has, what goes in each row, etc.</p>

<p>The delegate object itself is an object that knows what should go in the tableview, but not how to draw it.  It conforms to <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/DOCUMENTATION/Cocoa/Reference/ApplicationKit/Protocols/NSTableDataSource_Protocol/Reference/Reference.html"" rel=""nofollow""><code>NSTableViewDataSource</code></a> protocol (the equivalent of a Java ""interface"").  That way the <code>NSTableView</code> has a standard set of methods it can use to query the delegate and ask for the information it needs.</p>

<pre><code>- (id)initWithFormat:(NSString*)format, ...;
</code></pre>

<p>and </p>

<pre><code>- (id)initWithFormat:(NSString *)format arguments:(va_list)argList;
</code></pre>

<p>I assume that the protocol I wish to delegate to should suggest the implementation of:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)logEventWithFormat:(NSString *)format arguments:(va_list)argList;
</code></pre>

<p>so I the selector <code>@selector(logEventWithFormat:arguments:)</code> can be used an called with:</p>

<pre><code>[del performSelector:@selector(logEventWithFormat:arguments:) 
          withObject:format
          withObject:argList];

","115730","","<p>As far as I know, it can't be done.  You can't use <code>-performSelector:withObject:withObject:</code> because as @KennyTM points out, a <code>va_list</code> isn't an object.</p>

<p>However, you also cannot use <code>NSInvocation</code>.  <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSInvocation_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000212-1804"" rel=""nofollow"">The documentation straight up says so:</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>NSInvocation does not support
  invocations of methods with either
  variable numbers of arguments or union
  arguments.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since these are the two ways of invoking a method by selector, and neither seems to work, I'm going to go with the ""can't be done"" answer, unless you invoke the method directly and pass the <code>va_list</code> as an argument.</p>

<p>Also, what variables need to be put in the dealloc?  Only the variables I have in the @property/@synthesize?  Or do I need to release all the instance variables in the dealloc method.</p>

<p>I am just looking for some clarification on how instance variables work in Objective-C.  Thanks.</p>
","115730","","<p><code>@property</code> declarations are nothing more than compiler-generated getter and setter methods.  That's it.  Just the methods.  Obviously, you have to be getting and setting <em>something</em>, so we create the ivar that goes along with the getters and setters.  In your example above, your compiler is generating:</p>

<pre><code>- (NSMutableData *) receivedData;
- (void) setReceivedData:(NSMutableData *)newReceivedData;
</code></pre>

<p>The getter returns the value in the <code>receivedData</code> instance variable, and the setter changes the value in the <code>receivedData</code> instance variable.</p>

<p>(Side note: with the 64-bit runtime, you can skip declaring the instance variable, but I still like to put it in just to be explicit)</p>

<p>As for what you should do in your <code>dealloc</code> method, you need to release the instance variables that have been <code>retain</code>ed or <code>copy</code>ed.  So in your example, you'll need to do <code>[receivedData release];</code> in your <code>dealloc</code> method, because when you set the <code>receivedData</code> ivar, you retained the new value (that's what the <code>retain</code> means on the <code>@property</code> line).  If you don't specify either <code>retain</code> or <code>copy</code> in the <code>@property</code> declaration, then it defaults to <code>assign</code>, and you don't have to do anything.  Beyond this, you'll need to release any other instance variables that you retained yourself (ie, not through an <code>@property (retain)</code> setter).</p>

<p>For your last question, yes you can just do:</p>

<pre><code>tracking = [[NSString alloc] initWithFormat:@""Hello, %@!"", @""world""];
</code></pre>

<p>Inside your own class, you have direct access to all your own instance variables (and any protected and public ivars of your super classes).</p>

<pre><code>while([xyz retainCount]&gt;0) 
       [xyz release];

<p><code>retainCount</code> will never return 0, because as soon as you are at a retainCount of 1 and the object is released, the runtime just deallocates it right then and there, <em>never decrementing the retainCount</em>.  Even if it did decrement the retainCount, the object is now deallocated.  How are you going to ask it what it's retainCount is?</p>

<p>In a nutshell, your design is wrong.  If you can't keep track of how often you've retained an object in a smarter way, then <strong>you will have memory leaks</strong> and most likely crashes from overreleasing objects (this while loop will crash your app).</p>

<p>If you absolutely can't change your code (I wouldn't believe you if you said you couldn't), then you'd want to keep a second integer ivar indicating how many times you've retained <code>xyz</code>, and then use <em>that</em> to figure out how many times you should release it.  (However, this should be an absolute last ditch effort, as in Armaggeddon will happen if you don't get this working in 30 seconds.  You should really refactor your code first.)</p>

"
"<p>To begin with, let me say that I understand how and why the problem I'm describing can happen. I was a Computer Science major, and I understand overflow/underflow and signed/unsigned arithmetic. (For those unfamiliar with the topic, Apple's Secure Coding Guide <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Security/Conceptual/SecureCodingGuide/Articles/BufferOverflows.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002577-SW7"" rel=""nofollow"">discusses integer overflow</a> briefly.)</p>

<p>My question is about reporting and recovering from such an error once it has been detected, and more specifically in the case of an Objective-C framework. (I write and maintain <a href=""http://cocoaheads.byu.edu/code/CHDataStructures"" rel=""nofollow"">CHDataStructures</a>.) I have a few collections classes that allocate memory for storing objects and dynamically expand as necessary. I haven't yet seen any overflow-related crashes, probably because my test cases mostly use sane data. However, given unvalidated values, things could explode rather quickly, and I want to prevent that.</p>

<p>I have identified <em>at least</em> two common cases where this can occur:</p>

<ol>
<li>The caller passes a very large unsigned value (or negative signed value) to <code>-initWithCapacity:</code>.</li>
<li>Enough objects have been added to cause the capacity to dynamically expand, and the capacity has grown large enough to cause overflow.</li>
</ol>

<p>The easy part is detecting whether overflow will occur. (For example, before attempting to allocate <code>length * sizeof(void*)</code> bytes, I can check whether <code>length &lt;= UINT_MAX / sizeof(void*)</code>, since failing this test will mean that the product will overflow and potentially allocate a much smaller region of memory than desired. On platforms that support it, the <a href=""http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/removefile/removefile-17/checkint.h"" rel=""nofollow"">checkint.h API</a> is another alternative.) The harder part is determining how to deal with it gracefully. In the first scenario, the caller is perhaps better equipped (or at least in the mindset) to deal with a failure. The second scenario can happen anywhere in the code that an object is added to the collection, which may be quite non-deterministic.</p>

<p>My question, then, is this: <strong>How is ""good citizen"" Objective-C code expected to act when integer overflow occurs in this type of situation?</strong> (Ideally, since my project is a framework in the same spirit as Foundation in Cocoa, I'd like to model off of the way it behaves for maximum ""impedance matching"". The Apple documentation I've found doesn't mention much at all about this.) I figure that in any case, reporting the error is a given. Since the APIs to add an object (which could cause scenario 2) don't accept an error parameter, what can I really do to help resolve the problem, if anything? What is really considered okay in such situations? I'm loath to knowingly write crash-prone code if I can do better...</p>
","115730","","<p>I'd say the correct thing to do would be to do what the Cocoa collections do.  For example, if I have the following code:</p>

<pre><code>int main (int argc, const char * argv[]) {
    NSAutoreleasePool * pool = [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init];

    NSMutableArray * a = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init];

    for (uint32_t i = 0; i &lt; ULONG_MAX; ++i) {
        for (uint32_t i = 0; i &lt; 10000000; ++i) {
            [a addObject:@""foo""];
        }
        NSLog(@""%lu rounds of 10,000,000 completed"", i+1);
    }

    [a release];

    [pool drain];
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>..and just let it run, it will eventually die with EXC_BAD_ACCESS. (I compiled and ran this as a 32-bit app so I could be sure to run out of space when I hit 2**32 objects.</p>

<p>In other words, throwing an exception would be nice, but I don't think you really have to do anything.</p>

"<p>I have a graph with one kind of object called Message. A message could have childs so the graph is a tree.
Each object on the graph contains an attribute value; that's a sort of UUID (globally unique) so the store cannot contains multiple messages with the same UUID (this uuid is a string taken from message data so I can't replace it using the objectID of nsmanagedobject).
The problem happend when I need to validate object insertion into the store.
How can I check if a message with the same UUID is already present into the store? I'm thinking about a fetch request on validateForInsert: event but it seems too slow/complex when there are lots of objects to insert (about 30k in my case).

<p>The way I've gotten around this in the past is to use a convenience method to access and create my <code>NSManagedObjects</code>.  This convenience method then looks up in a static <code>NSMutableDictionary</code> to see if another object with the same unique attribute has already been created (the unique attribute being the key, and the managedObjectID being the value).  If it finds one, it just returns that object instead.  If it doesn't, then it goes about creating one and caching that object's ID into the static dictionary for future use.  When the app first launches, I have to pre-populate this dictionary with the attributes/identifiers of pre-existing objects.</p>

","115730","","<p>Matt S. is correct that if you can use the <code>NSEvent</code> API to get the mouse location.  However,  you don't have to poll in order to continuously get coordinates.  You can use a <code>CGEventTap</code> instead:</p>

<p>This way, your function <code>myCGEventCallback</code> will fire every time the mouse moves (regardless of whether your app is frontmost or not), without you having to poll for the information.

"<p>I'm in the middle of writing some Cocoa classes to parse ID3 tags from MP3 files. To make them as easy to use as possible, I'm allowing the option to request a tag by the actual ID3 frame id (""TCON"", ""TPE1"", ""TALB"", etc.) or an equivalent word/phrase (""genre"", ""artist"", ""album"", etc.)</p>

<p>To store this data, currently I have a reference class which returns an NSDictionary with the frame id's as keys, and word/phrases as objects. As I need to look up definitions in both directions, currently I have a second method which returns the dictionary 'switched round', so the words/phrases are the keys.</p>

<p>My question is whether there is a better way to represent this data. Ideally there would be something similar to NSDictionary, the difference being that both the keys and the values must be unique, and you could look up both an ""objectForKey:"" and a ""keyForObject:""</p>

"<p>I am some what confused as to the difference between accessing an instance variable via self or just by name (when working inside the class).</p>

<p>For instance, take this class:</p>

<pre><code>//In .h file:
@interface Register : NSObject {
    NSString *mName;
}

- (id) initWithName:(NSString *) name;

//In .m file:
- (id) initWithName:(NSString *)name
{
    if (self == [super init])
    {
        mName = name;
    }
    return self;
}
</code></pre>

<p>What's the difference between accessing the instance variable via</p>

<pre><code>self.mName = name;
</code></pre>

<p>vs</p>

<pre><code>mName = name;
</code></pre>

<p>Which isn't a @property and is not @sythenize'd.</p>

<p>Say it is this though, per this example:</p>

<pre><code>//In .h file:
@interface Manange_My_ViewsViewController : UIViewController { 
    IBOutlet UILabel *countLabel;
}

@property (nonatomic, retain) IBOutlet UILabel *countLabel;

//In .m file:
@synthesize countLabel;

- (void) updateLabel:(NSUInteger)count
{
    countLabel.text = [NSString stringWithFormat:@""%d"", count];
}
</code></pre>

<p>But say I accessed countLabel as:</p>

<pre><code>self.countLabel
</code></pre>

<p>What would be the difference?</p>

<p>Edit: Third example per users' answer:
Say it the iVar wasn't an IBOutlet:</p>

<pre><code>//In .h file:
@interface Fake : NSObject {
    NSString *mVar;
}
@property (nonatomic, retain) NSString *mVar;

//In .m file:
 @synthesize mVar;

 mVar = @"""";
</code></pre>

<p>VS</p>

<pre><code> self.mVar = @"""";
</code></pre>

<p>Or is it the same - that in the first we are accessing the actual instance variable and in the second we're actually going through the auto created setter (via @synthesize)?</p>

<p>Thanks all!</p>

<p>Edit: Update in response to Peter Hosey ...</p>

<p>So your thinking the convention of mVarName is bad? I took that from my C++ days.</p>

<p>But what about the case when you do?</p>

<pre><code>-(void) someMethod:(int) x
{
    x = x;
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can't do that (Say 'x' is also a class variable)</p>

<p>But you can do:</p>

<pre><code>-(void) someMethod:(int) x
{
    mX = x;
}
</code></pre>

<p>But your saying its better to do:</p>

<pre><code>-(void) someMethod:(int) x
{
    self.x = x;
}
</code></pre>
","115730","","<p>OK, first off is the basic difference:</p>

<pre><code>mVar = var;
</code></pre>

<p>This is just changing a value.  That's it.</p>

<pre><code>self.mVar = var;
</code></pre>

<p>This is equivalent to:</p>

<pre><code>[self setMVar:var];
</code></pre>

<p>In other words, one invokes a method, the other does not.  Using the <code>@property</code> syntax can give you some really neat benefits.  For example, you get key-value coding compliance for free.  That means that another object can observe this object's <code>mVar</code> property, and be automatically notified whenever it changes, <em>without you doing anything</em>.  You don't get this if you just access the ivar directly.  (Unless, of course, you implement it yourself.  But why would you do that?)</p>

<p>You also get semi-free memory management.  If you declare a property as <code>(retain)</code>, then you don't have to <code>[newValue retain]</code> yourself.  The synthesized method will do this for you (in both cases, you'd still have to <code>[ivar release]</code> in your <code>dealloc</code> method).</p>

<p>You also can get some degree of thread safety.  If you don't declare a property as <code>(nonatomic)</code>, then it is (by default) <code>atomic</code> (although that keyword does not exist; it's implied).  That means that reading/updating the value of the property is an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_operation"">atomic operation</a>.  If you were to just access the ivar directly, you'd have to implement the atomicity yourself with a lock.</p>

<p>Basically, using the synthesized methods gets you some really neat stuff for free.  The only reason I'd say to <em>not</em> use the <code>@property</code> syntax is if you have irrefutable evidence that invoking those methods is a bottleneck in your code.  However, you'll be <em>really</em> hard pressed to come up with a situation where that would be the case.</p>

<p>Long answer: Kind of.</p>

<ol>
<li>You can use an array, store your variables in there, and index into it.</li>
<li>Like #1, if your objects are actually UI elements and you don't want a whole bunch of <code>IBOutlets</code>, then use an <code>IBOutletCollection</code> instead.</li>
<li>You can use a dictionary, store your variables as values, and look them up by key.</li>
<li>You can declare all your variables as <code>@property</code>, and then use <code>[self valueForKey:]</code> to look them up by name.</li>
<li>You can build the name of the ivar as a string, and then use something like <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/ObjCRuntimeRef/Reference/reference.html#//apple_ref/c/func/object_getInstanceVariable""><code>object_getInstanceVariable()</code></a> to retrieve it's value directly (this is similar to #3, except you don't have to declare it as an <code>@property</code>).  This is excessively complicated and is usually a much bigger hammer than you'll actually need.</li>
<li>If you're dealing with views, you can assign each view a unique tag and then retrieve it via <code>[superview viewWithTag:aTag]</code>.  I do not recommend using this approach.</li>

<p>Let's suppose you have a double : 1.423</p>

<p>How would you get each  ""1"",  ""4"", ""2"", ""3"", that compose the double in several variables ?</p>

<p>In the end I would like to get something like : 
<PRE><CODE>
NSLog(@""here are the digits : %d , %d %d %d "", one, two, three, four);<br>
</CODE></PRE></p>

<p>one variable should be 1</p>

<p>two variable should should be 4</p>

<p>three variable should be 2</p>

<p>four variable should be 3</p>

<p>Any advice to achieve this in a nice way using ObjectiveC / cocoa Touch ? </p>

<p>How do I simply siphon from the argument incoming to the argument outgoing, preserving the exact same <code>nil</code> terminated list?</p>
","115730","","<p>You can't do this, at least not in the way you're wanting to do it.  What you want to do (pass on the variable arguments) requires having an initializer on <code>UIAlertView</code> that accepts a <code>va_list</code>.  There isn't one.  However, you can use the <code>addButtonWithTitle:</code> method:</p>

<pre><code>+ (void)showWithTitle:(NSString *)title
              message:(NSString *)message
             delegate:(id)delegate
    cancelButtonTitle:(NSString *)cancelButtonTitle
    otherButtonTitles:(NSString *)otherButtonTitles, ...
{
    UIAlertView *alert = [[[UIAlertView alloc] initWithTitle:title
                                                     message:message
                                                    delegate:delegate
                                           cancelButtonTitle:cancelButtonTitle
                                           otherButtonTitles:nil] autorelease];
    if (otherButtonTitles != nil) {
      [alert addButtonWithTitle:otherButtonTitles];
      va_list args;
      va_start(args, otherButtonTitles);
      NSString * title = nil;
      while(title = va_arg(args,NSString*)) {
          [alert addButtonWithTitle:title];
      }
      va_end(args);
    }

    [alert show];
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is, of course, very problem-specific.  The real answer is ""you can't implicitly pass on a variable argument list to a method/function that does not have a <code>va_list</code> parameter"".  You must therefore find a way around the problem.  In the example you gave, you wanted to make an alertView with the titles you passed in.  Fortunately for you, the <code>UIAlertView</code> class has a method that you can iteratively call to add buttons, and thereby achieve the same overall effect.  If it did not have this method, you'd be out of luck.</p>

<p>The other really messy option would be to make it a variadic macro.  A variadic macro looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>#define SHOW_ALERT(title,msg,del,cancel,other,...) { \
  UIAlertView *_alert = [[[UIAlertView alloc] initWithTitle:title message:msg delegate:del cancelButtonTitle:cancel otherButtonTitles:other, ##__VA_ARGS__] autorelease]; \
  [_alert show]; \
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, even with the variadic macro approach, you'd still need a custom macro for each time you wanted to do this.  It's not a very solid alternative.</p>

<p>Any ideas? It looks like the <code>NSArray</code> is being populated properly, then things are failing on/after the reloadData call (breakpoints confirm this, but can't isolate where things are going wrong)</p>

","115730","","<p>Something weird:  You're saying that you only have 1 row in each section, yet you're using <code>indexPath.row</code> to index into your array?  One of those is wrong, and I'm guessing it's the first.  Usually if you're displaying an array (of <em>n</em> elements) in a <code>UITableView</code>, you have one section and <em>n</em> rows in that section, which means you'd use <code>[myArray objectAtIndex:indexPath.row]</code> to retrieve the appropriate object.</p>

<p>If you want a separate section for each item in the array, then you say that you have <em>n</em> sections, and 1 row in each section, and then use <code>[myArray objectAtIndex:indexPath.section]</code> to retrieve the appropriate object.</p>

","115730","","<p>@Péter's answer is absolutely correct.  I'd like to add a bit more information:</p>

<ul>
<li>An object can only have one delegate.  However, many objects can listen to notifications from a single object.  Notifications are ""broadcasted"" to the entire application, and anybody who wants to can listen to the notification and react to it.</li>
<li>Delegate methods can have a return value.  In other words, they can return some value other than <code>(void)</code>.  Notification methods cannot return any object, because they have no object to return <em>to</em>.</li>
<li><strike>Delegate methods are invoked immediately, whereas notifications are usually delayed until the next loop through the run loop.  This means that objects can use their delegates to retrieve information immediately before continuing.  This is the main reason why delegates are so useful.  You can ask them for information and they will immediately respond with it.</strike></li>

<p>Can anyone offer some guidance on how to build one of these and make it look good? I need an input box that is shaped nicely like the UITextfield but will stretch vertically when typing. </p>

<p>I have worked on this everyday for a week and I have about given up on the UITextView. I can get it to stretch properly but when backspacing, the Textview height shrinks too much when going up a line. As I continue backspacing it corrects itself.

Then it corrects itself,.... etc.</p>

","115730","","<p>This is the sort of thing that will have to be done programmatically (as far as I'm aware).

"<p>I'm building an <code>NSPredicateEditor</code>, and I want the ability to do advanced date comparison.</p>

<p>I realize that I can build an <code>NSPredicateEditorRowTemplate</code> with a <code>rightExpressionType</code> of <code>NSDateAttributeType</code>, but the predicates I want to build need to be much more advanced than that.</p>

<p>For example, I need to basic comparison like:</p>

<li><code>dateKeypath isNotInTheLast n days</code> (or weeks, months, years)</li>
<li><code>dateKeypath between aDate and anotherDate</code></li>

<p>How can I achieve these sorts of comparisons?  I understand that I'll need to create a custom <code>NSPredicateEditorRowTemplate</code>, but I haven't found any clear documentation on how to achieve something like this.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> 
Bonus points are available for also knowing how to make these comparisons a full date-time (year-month-day-hour-minute-second) comparison (as <code>NSDateAttributeType</code> only has year-month-day granularity).</p>
","115730","","<p>In retrospect, this answer seems somewhat obvious:</p>

<p>I actually described <em>3</em> predicate editor row templates, not one.  The three templates are:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>dateKeyPath [&lt;, &lt;=, =, &gt;, &gt;=, !=] [NSDatePicker]</code></li>
<li><code>dateKeyPath [inTheLast, notInTheLast] [NSTextField] [NSPopUpButton]</code></li>
<li><code>dateKeyPath [between] [NSDatePicker] ""and"" [NSDatePicker]</code></li>
</ul>

<p>If you build these three predicate editor row templates and give them to the predicateEditor, the editor will realize that they're all using the same <code>dateKeyPath</code>, and display then crunch all their operators into a single popup button.  It will then switch out the actual views to the right of the operator depending on which operator is selected.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>For bonus points: you can modify the precision of the date pickers by overriding the <code>templateViews</code> method, retrieving the templateViews from <code>super</code>, and setting the <code>datePickerElements</code> on the appropriate pickers.</p>

","115730","","<p>I'm not sure if this is the cause of your problem but it might be:</p>

<p>You create your array of controllers, like so:</p>

<pre><code>NSArray *controllers = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:home, menu, so, events, info, nil];
</code></pre>

<p>That's fine.  <code>controllers</code> has a +0 (autoreleased) retain count.</p>

<p>You then assign it to the tabBar's <code>viewControllers</code> property:</p>

<pre><code>tabBarController.viewControllers = controllers;
</code></pre>

<p>That's also fine.  <code>controllers</code> now has a +1 retain count (autorelease + retain by <code>tabBarController</code>)</p>

<p>You then release <code>controllers</code>:</p>

<pre><code>[controllers release];
</code></pre>

<p><code>controllers</code> now has a +0 retain count, which means the next time the runloop spins, your array is going to get deallocated, the subsequent views will disappear (because they've been deallocated), and your app will probably end up crashing.</p>

<p>Simple fix:  You didn't <code>alloc</code>, <code>retain</code>, or <code>copy</code> the <code>controllers</code> array, so you are not responsible to <code>release</code> it.  Remove the <code>release</code> and your memory management will be proper.  It might solve your problem, because it's the only thing I immediately see that might be an issue.</p>

"<p>I am interfacing with a hardware device that streams data to my app over Wifi. The data is streaming in just fine. The data contains a character header (DATA:) that indicates a new record has begun. The issues is that the data I receive doesn't necessarily fall on the header boundary, so I have to capture the data until what I've captured contains the header. Then, everything that precedes the header goes into the previous record and everything that comes after it goes into a new record. I have this working, but wondered if anyone has done this before and has a good computer-sciencey way to solve the problem.</p>

<p>Here's what I do:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Convert the NSData of the current read to an NSString</p></li>
<li><p>Append the NSString to a placeholder string</p></li>
<li><p>Check placeholder string for the header (DATA:). If the header is not there, just wait for the next read.</p></li>
<li><p>If the header exists, append whatever precedes it to a previous record placeholder and hand that placeholder off to an array as a complete record that I can further parse into fields.</p></li>
<li><p>Take whatever shows up after the header and place it in the record placeholder so that it can be appended to in the next read. Repeat steps 3 - 5.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Let me know if you see any flaws with this or have a suggestion for a better way.</p>

<p>Seems there should be some design pattern for this, but I can't think of one.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>UPDATE: Here is a little bit of code:</p>

<pre><code>uint8_t buf[1024];
unsigned int len = 0;
len = [(NSInputStream *)stream read:buf maxLength:1024];
if(len) {    
    [data appendBytes:(const void *)buf length:len];
    int bytesRead;
    bytesRead += len;
} else {
    NSLog(@""No data."");
}
</code></pre>

<p>How would this code be changed then to implement a finite state machine?</p>
","115730","","<p>That seems pretty much how I'd do it.  The only thing I might do differently is write an <code>NSData</code> category that does the linear search of <code>DATA:</code> for me, just to save the overhead of converting it to a string.  It wouldn't be that hard to do, either.  Something like:</p>

<pre><code>@interface NSData (Search)

- (NSRange) rangeOfData:(NSData *)aData;

@end

@implementation NSData (Search)

- (NSRange) rangeOfData:(NSData *)aData {
  const void * bytes = [self bytes];
  NSUInteger length = [self length];

  const void * searchBytes = [aData bytes];
  NSUInteger searchLength = [aData length];
  NSUInteger searchIndex = 0;

  NSRange foundRange = {NSNotFound, searchLength};
  for (NSUInteger index = 0; index &lt; length; index++) {
    if (bytes[index] == searchBytes[searchIndex]) {
      //the current character matches
      if (foundRange.location == NSNotFound) {
        foundRange.location = index;
      }
      searchIndex++;
      if (searchIndex &gt;= searchLength) { return foundRange; }
    } else {
      searchIndex = 0;
      foundRange.location = NSNotFound;
    }
  }
  return foundRange;
}

@end
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can just use:</p>

<pre><code>NSData * searchData = [@""DATA:"" dataUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];
while(receivingData) {
  if ([receivedData rangeOfData:searchData].location != NSNotFound) {
    //WOOO!

","115730","","<p>Any outgoing communication generated by your application can be intercepted and replayed later.  If you wanted to be reasonably sure that a request is coming from your application, you can do things like embed public (not private) keys in your application and use it to sign  your communication.  However, in a situation like this, private and public keys don't do anything except provide non-repudiation (ie, prove that only the intended recipient can read the message, because they're the only one with the matching half of the keypair).</p>

<p>What you're looking for is providing authenticity.  You could do something like perform a DH key exchange ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie-Hellman_key_exchange"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie-Hellman_key_exchange</a> ) to generate a shared secret (since by hard coding a secret in your app does not ensure it's a secret), then using that secret to perform a specific manipulation on your message (although this still isn't perfect authenticity).</p>

<p>Or you could do something like inspect your app's code signature and verify that it's an appropriate signature and that it's your app, or something similar.</p>

<p>Perhaps Graham Lee will pop up and give a better answer. :)</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>(thinking aloud) Here's an idea:  Once your app is on the store, you could extract the code signature of the publish app, put that on your server, and use that in a challenge-response.  When your client connects to the server, your server could generate a random value and send it back.  The client could manipulate that value using the app's built-in code signature, and return the manipulated value.  Meanwhile, your server could be doing the same thing.  When the server gets the manipulated value, it could compare it with its version and then terminate/continue the connection based on whether they match.  Technically, this could still be spoofed (another app could steal the code signature and use it itself), but it seems like it'd be more secure.</p>

So it looks like you're out of luck until then.  There is no documentation as to what's actually getting leaked, because the leak is inside Apple's code and we (obviously) don't have ready access to Apple's source code.</p>

"<p>Why do parameters lists in some methods end with nil?  I have noticed this particularly in the collection classes for example NSSet</p>

<pre><code>mySet = [NSSet setWithObjects:someData, aValue, aString, nil];
</code></pre>

<p>and NSArray</p>

<pre><code>NSArray *objects = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:@""value1"", @""value2"", @""value3"", nil];
</code></pre>
","115730","","<p>It has to do with how variable argument lists work (<code>va_list</code>, seen as <code>...</code> in the parameters).  When the code is trying to extract all of the values in the list, it needs to know when to stop (because it doesn't know how many there are).  We denote the end of the list with a special value called a ""sentinel"", which is usually <code>NULL</code>.  That way, when the processing code comes across a <code>nil</code> in the <code>va_list</code>, it knows that it's reached the end.  If you leave out the <code>nil</code>, you'll get strange errors, because the code will just keep on reading down the stack, interpreting things as objects, until it finds a <code>nil</code>.</p>

<p>This is very similar to why C strings have to be <code>NULL</code>-terminated.</p>

<p>As a side note, the <code>stringWithFormat:</code> and similar <code>printf</code>-style methods don't need a sentinel, because it figures out how many parameters it needs based on how many <code>%</code> modifiers are in the format string.  So if you give a format string of <code>@""hello, %@""</code>, then it will only look for one extra argument, because there is only one % modifier.</p>

"<p>How can I make a Menu Extra like the Battery Meter in Cocoa? I can make a Status Item, but they are not movable.</p>
","115730","","<p>The <code>NSMenuExtra</code> functionality is private API.  The best you can do (without delving into Apple's private frameworks and figuring it out yourself) is to use <code>NSStatusItem</code>.</p>

<p>or should I use the property again and use ...</p>

<pre><code>[self setStatusValue: [self currentValue]];

<p>I suppose the latter (although maybe overkill) does tell the reader that we are using one of the objects instance variables and not some local variable.</p>

<p>just curious really, I was going with the bottom one, but just wanted to check before someone looked at my code and when ""what the hell"" :)</p>

<p>gary </p>
","115730","","<p>Both work just fine.  Which one you use may depend on the side-effects you wish.  For example, by using <code>[self currentValue]</code>, you may fire off <code>willAccessValueForKey:</code> and <code>didAccessValueForKey:</code> KVO notifications, but only if somebody's actually observing that property, and only if it's an <code>NSManagedObject</code> subclass.  Usually there aren't any major side effects.</p>

<p>Personally, I'd probably use the latter example, just so that I don't have to worry about changing the name of an iVar in 30 places if I decide to change it (of course, the Refactor->Rename tool would be the right to use in that situation, but still).</p>

","115730","","<p>Some thoughts:</p>

<p>Depending on which method you're running this code in, the outlets might not be hooked up yet.  The most common place to begin interacting with your outlets is in a <code>viewDidLoad</code>, <code>viewWillAppear:</code> or <code>viewDidAppear:</code> method, after the call to <code>super</code>'s implementation.  If you're trying to do this in your <code>init</code> method, your outlets are probably still <code>nil</code>.  The nib isn't loaded and the outlets aren't hooked up until somebody requests the <code>view</code> of your viewcontroller.  Might this be what you're experiencing?</p>

<p>If you <code>NSLog(@""%@"", browser);</code> in a method where you know the view should exist, but get <code>(null)</code> logged, then it's a sign that your outlets have lost their connections somehow.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT #1</strong> Are you sure you have the name of your xib spelled correctly when you call <code>initWithNibName:bundle:</code>?  (btw, you can pass in <code>nil</code> for the bundle, and it will assume <code>[NSBundle mainBundle]</code>)</p>

","115730","","<p>(This is not an answer, but a suggestion)</p>

<p>I think you're trying to make this too complicated.  You really have two problems:</p>

<li>Break a paragraph into sentences</li>
<li>Identify which sentences contain a 4-digit number, probably in the range of 1900-2100 or so.</li>
</ol>

<p>Point #1 is quite difficult, because of the ambiguous use of the . character.  For example, how would you process the sentences:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I was born in 1986.  Mr. Smith was born in 1976.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You need to be able to recognize that the period after ""Mr"" is not a sentence terminating character, and that there are actually two sentences.  Most answers you get (including @Tatu's) will do a naïve split based on the period.</p>

<p><em>edit</em> another use case:  money</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I earned $42.00 yesterday that I don't have to report on my 2010 tax return.</p>

"<p>How do you get the size of an NSarray and print it in the console using <em>NSLog</em>? </p>
","115730","","<p>An answer to another answer:</p>

<p>You can't get the size of the array in megabytes, at least not without doing some tricky, unsupported* C voodoo. <code>NSArray</code> is a class cluster, which means we don't know how it's implemented internally.  Indeed, the implementation used can <a href=""http://ridiculousfish.com/blog/archives/2005/12/23/array/"" rel=""nofollow"">change depending on how many items are in the array</a>. Moreover, the size of the array is disjoint from the size of the objects the array references, since those objects live elsewhere on the heap. Even the structure that holds the object pointers isn't technically ""part"" of the array, since it isn't necessarily <code>calloc</code>'d right next to the actual <code>NSArray</code> on the heap.</p>

<p>If you want the size of the array struct itself, well that's apparently only 4 bytes:</p>

<pre><code>NSLog(@""Size: %d"", sizeof(NSArray));
</code></pre>

<p>Prints:</p>

<pre><code>2010-03-24 20:08:33.334 EmptyFoundation[90062:a0f] Size: 4

<p>(Granted, that's not a decent representation, since <code>NSArray</code> is probably just an abstract interface for another kind of object, usually something like an <code>NSCFArray</code>.  If you look in <code>NSArray.h</code>, you'll see that an <code>NSArray</code> has no instance variables.  Pretty weird for something that's supposed to hold other objects, eh?)</p>

"<p>I've seen a bunch of similar questions to this, but nothing seems to be completely what I'm looking for. Do forgive me if I have missed the solution answered in another question, though!</p>

<p>Right. I have a view. 160 pixels both tall and wide. I know that this view is going to be used as a subview, and I know that it <em>always</em> needs to be centered about both axis in whatever situation it's used.</p>

<p>If defining the view programmatically, how can I be sure that it is always perfectly centered, horizontally and vertically, relative to its superview?</p>

<p>So far, all I have is this simple code:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)loadView {
    self.view = [[UIView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(80, 150, 160, 160)];
    self.view.backgroundColor = [UIColor greenColor];
    self.view.autoresizingMask = (UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleLeftMargin | UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleRightMargin | UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleTopMargin | UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleBottomMargin);
    [self.view release];
}
</code></pre>

<p>This does the centralization, but only in the simplest of cases. Any insight is greatly appreciated.</p>

<h3>EDIT 1:</h3>

<p>With the addition of the following line of code:</p>

<pre><code> self.view.center = self.view.superview.center;
</code></pre>

<p>The subview's center point becomes the (0,0) coordinate of the superview. Perhaps I haven't set up the superview correctly?</p>
","115730","","<p>In addition to what @Jasarien and @Brad have said, don't forget that you can force auto-centering using the Autosizing springs and struts.  Essentially (in Interface Builder) you click around until there are no Autosizing lines visible, like this:</p>

<p><img src=""http://gallery.me.com/davedelong/100084/Screen-20shot-202010-03-26-20at-2010-49-18-20AM/web.jpg?ver=12696222220001"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>In code, you set the <code>-[UIView autoresizingMask]</code> to:</p>

<pre><code>(UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleLeftMargin   | 
 UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleRightMargin  | 
 UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleTopMargin    | 
 UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleBottomMargin)
</code></pre>

<p>If you do these, then the view stays centered automatically.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT #1</strong></p>

<p>Answering your edit, you can't do:</p>

<pre><code>self.view.center = self.view.superview.center;
</code></pre>

<p>Unless your view has been added as a subview of another view (<code>[anotherView addSubview:self.view];</code>).  My guess is that <code>self.view.superview</code> is returning <code>nil</code>, and so you're (luckily) getting <code>{0,0}</code> as the return value when trying to invoke <code>center</code> on <code>nil</code>.</p>

<p>The proper place to center your view would probably be in the <code>viewWillAppear:</code> method of the view controller.  Once the view is about to appear, you know that it <em>must</em> have a superview (otherwise how else would it be about to appear?).  You could safely set your view's <code>center</code> there.</p>

<pre><code>        UISwitch *mySwitch = [[[UISwitch alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectZero] autorelease];
        [mySwitch addTarget:self action:@selector(switchToggled2:) forControlEvents: UIControlEventTouchUpInside];
        if(at_songs){

            [mySwitch setOn:YES animated:NO];

        }
        [cell addSubview:mySwitch];
        cell.accessoryView = mySwitch;
</code></pre>

<p><br />
<br />
And the following to know when it was tapped:</p>

<pre><code>-(IBAction)switchToggled1:(id)sender {


    NSUserDefaults *prefs;

    NSLog(@""Tapped Login Switch"");

    prefs = [NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults];

    if(at_login){
        [prefs setObject:@""NO"" forKey:@""autotweet_login""];
        at_login = NO;
    }else{
        [prefs setObject:@""YES"" forKey:@""autotweet_login""]; 
        at_login = YES;
    }



}
</code></pre>

<p>Turning the switch ON is not a problem. The problem NOW is that when the UISwitch is set to OFF, for some reason its action gets called twice (And I get 2 NSLogs for 1 tap).</p>

<p><br />
<br />
<strong>Why is the action getting called TWICE for only one tap to turn the switch OFF? How do I fix it?</strong></p>
","115730","","<p>Give the switch a target and action:</p>

","115730","","<p>From the <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/cocoa/conceptual/Exceptions/Exceptions.html"">Introduction to Exception Programming Topics</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Important</strong>: You should reserve the use of exceptions for programming or unexpected runtime errors such as out-of-bounds collection access, attempts to mutate immutable objects, sending an invalid message, and losing the connection to the window server. You usually take care of these sorts of errors with exceptions when an application is being created rather than at runtime.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Instead of exceptions, error objects (NSError) and the Cocoa error-delivery mechanism are the recommended way to communicate expected errors in Cocoa applications.

"<p>The iPhone app that I released is a wireless game controller, it translates touches on the device into key-presses on the networked Mac.

<p>Thanks!</p>
","115730","","<p>Core Data is certainly an excellent option, as @Jack has shown.  There are some other options as well.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><code>NSCoding</code> - You can make your model objects conform to the NSCoding protocol (similar to <code>java.io.Serializable</code>), which means you'd be able to directly write them to files.  I've found that this is a great option when I don't have massive amounts of data to persist, and the data that I am persisting has a relatively simple structure.</p></li>
<li><p>SQLite - If your data is very relational, you may want to consider using a database (probably SQLite) directly.  Core Data is an object store, and while it handles things like relationships between objects, it doesn't allow you to do really useful things like <code>INNER/LEFT/OUTER/CROSS/NATURAL JOIN</code> or other multi-table operators.</p></li>
<li><p><code>NSUserDefaults</code> - if your data is very small and is just essentially key-value pairs, then you can probably throw it all into the <code>NSUserDefaults</code> object, which will persist it for you in the preferences file.  However, even if your data is simple, <code>NSUserDefaults</code> might not be the best option if you have lots of it.</p></li>

"<p>I know you shouldn't use this to decide whether or not to change an array:</p>

<pre><code>if ([possiblyMutable isKindOfClass:[NSMutableArray class]])
</code></pre>

<p>But say I'm writing a method and need to return either an <code>NSMutableArray</code> or an <code>NSArray</code>, depending on the mutability of <code>possiblyMutable</code>. The class using my method already knows whether or not it's acceptable to change the returned array. Whether or not it's acceptable to change the returned array directly correlates with whether or not it's acceptable to change <code>possiblyMutable</code>.</p>

<p>In that specific case, is this code safe? It seems to me that if it's <em>not</em> acceptable to change the array, but we accidentally get a mutable array, it's ok, because the class using my method won't try to change it. And if it <em>is</em> acceptable to change the array, then we will <em>always</em> get <code>possiblyMutable</code> as an <code>NSMutableArray</code> (though this is the part I'm not entirely clear on).</p>

<p>So... safe or not? Alternatives?</p>
","115730","","<p>No.  Not safe at all.</p>

NSLog(@""Normal: %@"", [aa className]);

  2010-04-05 13:17:26.956 EmptyFoundation[55496:a0f] Normal: NSCFArray</p>

<p>You also can't do:</p>

<pre><code>NSLog(@""Mutable add: %d"", [ma respondsToSelector:@selector(addObject:)]);
NSLog(@""Normal add: %d"", [aa respondsToSelector:@selector(addObject:)]);

Therefore, when you later do:  <code>obj = nil;</code>, you're only affecting the pointer <em>outside</em> of the array.  The array will still contain <code>0x1234567890</code>.</p>

I need to add/remove keys from the list when object is added / removed from database. I'm using an ArrayList right now but I'm afraid ArrayList would not suit it when the number of records grows. (Imagine you have to iterate over several hundred thousands of elements every time an object is removed from database). Back to the time when I did .NET programming, then I would use a sorted List (List is a .NET class that once Sorted property set to true, will maintain order of its element, and provide binary search that help remove/insert element very quick).

"<p>I'm trying to setup automated unit tests for an iPhone application. I'm using a UIWebView and need to simulate clicks on different links.

The main problem is with links that have their <code>target</code> property set.</p>

<p>When you manually click on a standard ""popup"" link (e.g. <code>&lt;a href=""http://example.com"" target=""_blank""&gt;</code>), the UIWebView will ignore the click event and won't navigate to anything. If you then try clicking on this very same link automatically via the JavaScript <code>dispatchEvent()</code> method, the UIWebView will completely ignore the <code>target</code> attribute and will open up the link normally in the current page.</p>

<p>I need an my automatic unit testing to produce the <strong>exact</strong> same results as when you manually click a link.</p>

<p>I believe the only way for this automated unit test to work correctly is to simulate a mouse click at a specific x/y coordinate (i.e. where the link is located). Since the unit testing will only be used internally, private API calls are fine.</p>

<p>It seems like this should be possible since the iPhone app <a href=""http://www.vimov.com/isimulate/features/"" rel=""nofollow"">isimulate</a> seems to do something similar.</p>

"<p>I've got a text file, with about 200,000 lines. Each line represents an object with multiple properties. I only search through one of the properties (the unique ID) of the objects. If the unique ID I'm looking for is the same as the current object's unique ID, I'm gonna read the rest of the object's values.</p>

<p>Right now, each time I search for an object, I just read the whole text file line by line, create an object for each line and see if it's the object I'm looking for - which is basically the most inefficient way to do the search. I would like to read all those objects into memory, so I can later search through them more efficiently.</p>

<p>The question is, what's the most efficient way to perform such a search? Is a 200,000-entries NSArray a good way to do this (I doubt it)? How about an NSSet? With an NSSet, is it possible to only search for one property of the objects?</p>

","115730","","<p>@yngvedh is correct in that an <code>NSDictionary</code> has O(1) lookup time (as is expected for a map structure).  However, after doing some testing, you can see that <code>NSSet</code> also has O(1) lookup time.  Here's the basic test I did to come up with that:  <a href=""http://pastie.org/933070"">http://pastie.org/933070</a></p>

<p>Basically, I create 1,000,000 strings, then time how long it takes me to retrieve 100,000 random ones from both the dictionary and the set.  When I run this a few times, the set actually appears to be faster...</p>

<pre><code>dict lookup: 0.174897

<p>In your particular case, I'm not sure either of these will be what you want.  You say that you want all of these objects in memory, but do you really need them all, or do you just need a few of them?  If it's the latter, then I would probably read through the file and create an object ID to file offset mapping (ie, remember where each object id is in the file).  Then you could look up which ones you want and use the file offset to jump to the right spot in the file, parse that line, and move on.  This is a job for <code>NSFileHandle</code>.</p>

"<p>How do I detect two fingers tap on the iPhone?</p>
","115730","","<p>If you can target OS 3.2 or above, you can use a <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UITapGestureRecognizer_Class/Reference/Reference.html""><code>UITapGestureRecognizer</code></a>.  It's really easy to use: just configure it and attach it to the view.  When the gesture is performed, it'll fire the action of the gestureRecognizer's target.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>UITapGestureRecognizer * r = [[UITapGestureRecognizer alloc] initWithTarget:self action:@selector(viewWasDoubleTapped:)];
[r setNumberOfTapsRequired:2];
[[self view] addGestureRecognizer:r];
[r release];

"<p>I've got a statusbar item that pops open an NSMenu, and I have a delegate set and it's hooked up correctly (<code>-(void)menuNeedsUpdate:(NSMenu *)menu</code> works fine).

<p>Thanks :)</p>

<p><em><strong>EDIT</em></strong></p>

<p>Ok, I'm now here:</p>

<p>When you click on the menu item (in the status bar), a selector is called that runs an NSTask. I use the notification center to listen for when that task is finished, and write:</p>

    [mitm setIndentationLevel:2];
    [menu insertItem:mitm atIndex:2];
    [mitm release];
}
</code></pre>

<p>This method is definitely called because if I click out of the menu and immediately back onto it, I get an updated menu with this information in it. The problem is that it's not updating -while the menu is open-.</p>
","115730","","<p>(If you want to change the layout of the menu, similar to how the Airport menu shows more info when you option click it, then keep reading.  If you want to do something entirely different, then this answer may not be as relevant as you'd like.)</p>

<p>The key is <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/cocoa/reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSMenuItem_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000265-BAJCBHBG""><code>-[NSMenuItem setAlternate:]</code></a>.  For an example, let's say we're going to build an <code>NSMenu</code> that has a <code>Do something...</code> action in it.  You'd code that up as something like:</p>

<pre><code>NSMenu * m = [[NSMenu alloc] init];

NSMenuItem * doSomethingPrompt = [m addItemWithTitle:@""Do something..."" action:@selector(doSomethingPrompt:) keyEquivalent:@""d""];
[doSomethingPrompt setTarget:self];
[doSomethingPrompt setKeyEquivalentModifierMask:NSShiftKeyMask];

NSMenuItem * doSomething = [m addItemWithTitle:@""Do something"" action:@selector(doSomething:) keyEquivalent:@""d""];
[doSomething setTarget:self];
[doSomething setKeyEquivalentModifierMask:(NSShiftKeyMask | NSAlternateKeyMask)];
[doSomething setAlternate:YES];

//do something with m
</code></pre>

<p>Now, you'd think that that would create a menu with two items in it: ""Do something..."" and ""Do something"", and you'd be partly right.  Because we set the second menu item to be an alternate, and because both menu items have the same key equivalent (but different modifier masks), then only the first one (ie, the one that is by default <code>setAlternate:NO</code>) will show.  Then when you have the menu open, if you press the modifier mask that represents the second one (ie, the option key), then the menu item will transform in real time from the first menu item to the second.</p>

<p>This, for example, is how the Apple menu works.  If you click once on it, you'll see a few options with ellipses after them, such as ""Restart..."" and ""Shutdown..."".  The HIG specifies that if there's an ellipsis, it means that the system will prompt the user for confirmation before executing the action.  However, if you press the option key (with the menu still open), you'll notice they change to ""Restart"" and ""Shutdown"".  The ellipses go away, which means that if you select them while the option key is pressed down, they will execute immediately without prompting the user for confirmation.</p>

<p>The same general functionality holds true for the menus in status items.  You can have the expanded information be ""alternate"" items to the regular info that only shows up with the option key is pressed.  Once you understand the basic principle, it's actually quite easy to implement without a whole lot of trickery.</p>

For objective C methods returning Core foundation objects,  see <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2901942/ownership-regarding-to-returned-quartz-objects"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2901942/ownership-regarding-to-returned-quartz-objects</a></p>
","115730","","<p>Correct.  Autorelease pools exist in the Foundation layer and above (AppKit/UIKit, etc).  They don't exist for CoreFoundation/CoreGraphics objects.</p>

<p>The simple way around this is to rename your function.  If your function is currently named:</p>

<pre><code>CGMutablePathRef myAwesomePath(params...);
</code></pre>

<p>Then you should rename it to:</p>

<pre><code>CGMutablePathRef createMyAwesomePath(params...);
</code></pre>

<p>so that you are safe to return an object with a +1 retain count by following the <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/CoreFoundation/Conceptual/CFMemoryMgmt/Concepts/Ownership.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001148-103029"" rel=""nofollow"">Create rule</a>.</p>

"<p>everyone. I've been experimenting with Cocoa and Objective-C programming on the Mac for a few months now, and I am wanting to start developing applications that manage large amounts of data. The trouble is, I'm not really sure where to start with databases. </p>

<p>is there a way to get the position in simulator (3.2 ipad) ?
i live in germany and here the ipad isnt released yet, so i cannot test it on my device.</p>

"<p>In C or any ECMAscript based language you 'call a public method or function' on an object. But in documentation for Objective C, there are no public method calls, only the sending of messages.</p>

<p>Is there anything wrong in thinking that when you 'send a message' in ObjC you are actually 'calling a public method on an Object'.?</p>
","115730","","<p>Theoretically, they're different.</p>

<p>Practically, not so much.</p>

<p>They're different in that in Objective-C, objects can choose to not respond to messages, or forward messages on to different objects, or whatever.  In languages like C, function calls are really just jumping to a certain spot in memory and executing code.  There's no dynamic behavior involved.</p>

<p>However, in standard use cases, when you send a message to an object, the method that the message represented will usually end up being called.  So about 99% of the time, sending a message will result in calling a method.  As such, we often say ""call a method"" when we really mean ""send a message"".  So practically, they're almost always the same, <em>but they don't have to be</em>.</p>

<p>To directly answer your question, there's usually nothing wrong with saying ""calling a method"" instead of ""sending a message"".  However, it's important to understand that there is a very significant implementation difference.</p>

<p>At the end of the init call the retain count is at 1 (Note the iVar is not defined as a property).</p>

<p>When I step into the viewWillAppear method the myNSDate has vanished. I tried to do an explicit retain on it, but that only lasts until I update the iVar using the above method again.</p>

<p>I though - ok - I add the retain to the return of the function, but that makes the leak analyser throw up an error.</p>

<p>What am I doing wrong?</p>
","115730","","<p>Your method <code>firstDayOfMonth</code> is correct as it is given in your question.  However, the return value of that method is an autoreleased date, which means that if you don't retain the return value somewhere else, <strong>it will disappear</strong>.</p>

<p>So you need to do something like this (assuming your ivar is named <code>firstDayOfMonth</code>:</p>

<pre><code>- (id) init {
  if (self = [super init...]) {
    ...
    [self setFirstDayOfMonth:[[NSDate date] firstDayOfMonth]];
  }
  return self;
}

- (void) setFirstDayOfMonth:(NSDate *)newFirstDay {
  [firstDayOfMonth release];
  firstDayOfMonth = [newFirstDay retain];
}

- (void) dealloc {
  [firstDayOfMonth release];
  ...
  [super dealloc];
}
</code></pre>

<p>In this, you're explicitly retaining the return value (but also making sure to <code>release</code> the old value so you're not leaking memory).  Now your date object will live until you set a new date, or the object is deallocated and the date is destroyed in the <code>dealloc</code> method.</p>

<pre>+ (Fruit *) createFruit {
  //autorelease, because the Create Rule only applies to CoreFoundation functions
  return [[[Fruit alloc] init] autorelease];

<li><p>Instance variables are <code>@protected</code> by default.  That means they can be directly accessed by the class and any subclasses.  You can make it <code>@protected</code>, <code>@private</code>, <code>@public</code>, and <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/772600/what-does-the-package-directive-do-in-objective-c""><code>@package</code></a>.  You do so like this:</p>

<pre>@interface Apple : Fruit {

  int iSeed

...
@end</pre></li>
<li><p>If you want an instance variable to be readonly, then don't declare it as <code>@public</code>, but make a getter for it.  For example:</p>

<pre>- (int) iSeeds {
  return iSeeds;
}</pre></li>
<li><p>However, since the instance variable is readonly, you can't set it externally.  The way around this is to give the Apple a iSeed value during initialization:</p>

<pre>- (id) initWithSeeds:(int)aniSeedValue {
  if (self = [super init]) {
    iSeed = aniSeedValue;
  }
  return self;
}</pre>

<p>Then make your <code>createAppleWithColor:(int)iSeeds</code> method like:</p>

You can easily construct an <code>NSAttributedString</code> from RTF data; HTML will be much more difficult.

That data would then be set on the ipad and an application requesting location would get the service data.</p>

","115730","","<p>No, it is not.</p>

<li>As soon as you <code>return</code>, then that method stops and you don't execute any more.  This means that you go through the first iteration of the loop, you'll stop.  Forever.</li>

<li>There's no such method as <code>appendText:</code>.  You probably mean <code>appendString:</code></li>

<p>Here's another question:  Why do you need to return a value at all?  You're passing in an <code>NSMutableString</code> and modifying it, so why not just <em>always</em> modify it in place and not bother with a return value?  For example:</p>

","115730","","<p>You can create a new method on your entity, which we'll call <code>monthOfDate</code>.  This method simply uses <code>[self dateAttribute]</code> and <code>NSDateComponents</code> to extract what the month of the date is.</p>

<pre><code>//assuming 1-based month indexing
NSPredicate * julyEntities = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@""monthOfDate = 7""]; 
</code></pre>

<p>The trick here is realizing that the left keypath of your predicate will result in a method invocation.  So if you set the left keypath to ""monthOfDate"", it will end up invoking your <code>monthOfDate</code> method and using the return value of the method as the comparison value in the predicate.

<p>In principle I could use a UINavigationController and just keep pushing new controllers for each step of the process. But this seems rather inefficient since the process I'm modeling has no notion of navigating backwards so all previous views would pointlessly stay around and use up resources. </p>

<p>At the moment I keep adding and removing a subview to one ""master"" viewcontroller and basically swapping out the contents. This works but feels rather clunky and I hope there is some nicer way to achieve this.</p>

<p>Additionally there needs to be an animated transition between the views. (I have this working at the moment via beginAnimations / commitAnimations)</p>

<p>UPDATE:
To clarify my question: I'm aware that wizards usually have a back button. That's not what I'm building here.<br>
The process that has to be shown possibly has a lot of steps (up to around 30-40 in some cases probably) so I really don't want to have 39 obsolete view controllers taking up ram. </p>

"<p>I'm trying to get a part of my window to react to drag and drop. In this case to copy the file path to the file being dropped on the view. I have looked over some documentation but I still have some problems to see exactly where I should implement my methods for drag and drop. </p>

<p>I have seen some examples but almost all of them assumes that I want to drop an image on the view. I'm pretty new to cocoa and Xcode so, I have some problems with seeing the exact relation between interface builder and the generated code. </p>

","115730","","<p>This looks mostly correct.  A couple of notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>you've misspelled ""viewDidLoad"".  This could be a side effect of typing it into the browser window.  If it's wrong in your code, then it's certainly not helping things be better.</li>
<li><code>viewForZoomingInScrollView:</code> is expecting you to return a <code>UIView</code>.  <code>myImage</code> sounds suspiciously <em>unlike</em> a <code>UIView</code>.  You should be returning the <code>imageView</code> instance variable.  That's what's getting moved around.</li>

<p>Short Version: EXC_BAD_ACCESS is crashing my app, and zombie-mode revealed the culprit to be my predicate embedded within the fetch request embedded in my Fetched Results Controller. How does an object within an object get released without an explicit command to do so?</p>

<p>Long Version:
Application Structure
Platforms View Controller -> Games View Controller (Predicated upon platform selection) -> Add Game View Controller</p>

<p>When a row gets clicked on the Platforms view, it sets an instance variable in Games View for that platform, then the Games Fetched Results Controller builds a fetch request in the normal way:</p>

<pre><code>- (NSFetchedResultsController *)fetchedResultsController{
if (fetchedResultsController != nil) {
  return fetchedResultsController;
}
//build the fetch request for Games
NSFetchRequest *request = [[NSFetchRequest alloc] init];
NSEntityDescription *entity = [NSEntityDescription 
  entityForName:@""Game""
  inManagedObjectContext:context];
[request setEntity:entity];
//predicate
NSPredicate *predicate = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@""platform == %@"",
  selectedPlatform];
[request setPredicate:predicate];
//sort based on name
NSSortDescriptor *sortDescriptor = [[NSSortDescriptor alloc] initWithKey:@""name""
  ascending:YES];
NSArray *sortDescriptors = [[NSArray alloc] initWithObjects:sortDescriptor, nil];
[request setSortDescriptors:sortDescriptors];

//fetch and build fetched results controller
NSFetchedResultsController *aFetchedResultsController = [[NSFetchedResultsController alloc] 
  initWithFetchRequest:request 
  managedObjectContext:context 
  sectionNameKeyPath:nil 
  cacheName:@""Root""];
aFetchedResultsController.delegate = self;
self.fetchedResultsController = aFetchedResultsController;

[sortDescriptor release];
[sortDescriptors release];
[predicate release];
[request release];
[aFetchedResultsController release];

return fetchedResultsController;
} 
</code></pre>

<p>At the end of this method, the fetchedResultsController's _fetch_request -> _predicate member is set to an NSComparisonPredicate object. All is well in the world.</p>

<p>By the time - (NSInteger)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView numberOfRowsInSection:(NSInteger)section gets called, the _predicate is now a Zombie, which will eventually crash the application when the table attempts to update itself.</p>

<p>I'm more or less flummoxed. I'm not releasing the fetched results controller or any of it's parts, and the only part getting dealloc'd is the predicate. Any ideas? </p>

<p>EDIT:
As a test, I added this line to the Fetched Results Controller method:</p>

<pre><code>[fetchedResultsController.fetchRequest.predicate retain];
</code></pre>

<p>And now it doesn't crash, but that seems like a patch, not something I should be doing.</p>
","115730","","<p>You shouldn't be releasing your <code>predicate</code> variable.  You didn't invoke <code>new</code>, <code>alloc</code>, <code>retain</code>, or <code>copy</code> (This is the ""narc"" rule) to create the predicate, so you are not responsible for <code>releasing</code> it.

"<p>I'm quite new to iphone programming and I want to do the following stuff:</p>

<ol>
<li>get data from a JSON REST web server</li>
<li>parse the received data using YAJL</li>
<li>Draw a graph with those data using core-plot</li>
</ol>

<p>So, 1th item is fine, I use ASIHttpRequest which runs as espected
3rd is almost fine (I still have to learn how to tune core-plot).</p>

<p>The problem I have is regarding 2nd item.
I use YAJL as it seems to be the faster parser, so why not give it a try :)</p>

<p>Here is the part of code that gets the data from the server and parse them:</p>

<pre><code>// Get server data
response_data = [request responseData];

// Parse JSON received
self.arrayFromData = [response_data yajl_JSON];
NSLog(@""Array from data: %@"", self.arrayFromData);
</code></pre>

<p>The parsing works quite well in fact, the NSLog output is something like:</p>

<p>2010-06-14 17:56:35.375 TEST_APP[3733:207] Array from data : </p>

<pre><code>{
data =     (
            {
        val = 1317;
        date = ""2010-06-10T15:50:01+02:00"";
    },
            {
        val = 1573;
        date = ""2010-06-10T16:20:01+02:00"";
    },
        ........
    {
        val = 840;
        date = ""2010-06-11T14:50:01+02:00"";
    },
            {
        val = 1265;
        date = ""2010-06-11T15:20:01+02:00"";
    }
);
from = ""2010-06-10T15:50:01+02:00"";
to = ""2010-06-11T15:20:01+02:00"";

}

<li>I show a punch of Markers on a MapView (Annotation Class is Location) which should be shown based on the selection of the filters in the mentioned Filter TableView.</li>
</ul>

<p>I need to implement a ""Filter by Category"" function which removes all markers and add them again but just based on the selection in the list.</p>

<p>So i need to compare the array with the filter-id's in the Location Model with the Array with all the Filter-ID's in the TableView. i used the following function for this:</p>

<pre><code>for (Location *currLocation in arrListOfLocationsNearby) {
</code></pre>

<p>for (NSString *currKatId in currLocation.arrKatIds) {</p>

<pre><code>NSInteger intCurrKatId = [currKatId integerValue];
NSLog(@""Current KatId %@ id: %d \n"", currLocation.strAdr, intCurrKatId);

for (Filter *currFilter in [SDM getSharedDataManager].arrListOfFilterOptions) {

 if (currFilter.isSelected) {

  NSInteger intCurrFilterId = [currFilter.strAtt_id intValue];
  NSLog(@""Current Filter %@ id: %d \n"", currFilter.strAtt_text, intCurrFilterId);

  if ([currKatId intValue] == [currFilter.strAtt_id intValue]) {
   currLocation.isVisible = YES;
  }else {
   currLocation.isVisible = NO;
  }
 }
}
</code></pre>

<p>}
  }</p>

  int sourceLen = strlen(source);

<p>There are a couple notes about this:</p>

<li>This will encode spaces as ""+""</li>
<li>This encodes everything except a-z (upper and lowercase), numbers, period, hyphen, underscore, and tilde</li>
<li><p>This will properly encode unicode characters as multiple octets.  For example, I can do:</p>

I copied and pasted it into an empty project, like this:</p>

<p>The reason your code isn't working is because you're logging the string <em>as the format string</em>, which means it's seeing the <code>%2</code> stuff and trying to replace it with other things.  Observe:</p>

<pre><code>NSString * string = @""00000000-0000-1000-8000-0013775CE6D2"";
NSString *result = (NSString*)CFURLCreateStringByAddingPercentEscapes(kCFAllocatorDefault, (CFStringRef)string, NULL, CFSTR(""'\""?=&amp;+&lt;&gt;;:-""), kCFStringEncodingUTF8);

","115730","","<p>You have to do this yourself.

","115730","","<p>Q: ""why would the <code>[toutImage autorelease];</code> kill the app?""</p>

<p>A: Because you're releasing an object that you don't own.  <code>+[NSString stringWithFormat:]</code> does not return an object that you own (because <code>stringWithFormat:</code> does not contain <code>new</code>, <code>alloc</code>, <code>retain</code>, or <code>copy</code>), so you <em>must</em> not release it.  If you do, you'll basically end up with a ""double free"" (you try to free memory that's already been free'd), and that will crash your app.</p>

"<p>So I have an application that currently upload images to a web service using a multipart form and I do this pretty simply using an NSMutableRequest and NSURLConnection.  The problem I seem to be coming into though is I want to be able to upload a given file without loading it into the program as an NSData object, but simply from the file path.

","115730","","<p>You're mistaken.  You can't just send a file path to the remote server, because the server would still just have the path, but none of the contents of the file.  Even ASIHTTPRequest is still reading the file into memory and creating the HTTP request with the file contents in the request body.  They just have a nicer API for doing it.</p>

<p>So technically, you <em>can</em> just post a file by providing a path to ASIHTTPRequest, but ASIHTTPRequest is just doing the dirty work for you.  At some point you're going to have to load the file into memory.</p>

<p>An alternative would be to create a custom <code>NSInputStream</code> subclass (let's call it HTTPPostStream) that dynamically builds the HTTP POST body, given some file paths and what not.  Then it could stream bytes directly off the disk and into the outgoing request, saving you from loading a large file into memory.

","115730","","<p>There's are some side effects that no one has mentioned:</p>

<ul>
<li>Atomicity - if you don't declare a property as <code>nonatomic</code>, then (by default) it is an atomic property, which means that the value of the property will be full retrieved regardless of what other threads might be doing to mutate the property at the same time.  If you have an atomic property and then override the getter or setter, you lose the atomicity (unless you implement it yourself).</li>
<li>Key-Value observation - by using the <code>@synthesized</code> methods, you are ensuring KVO compliance, which makes it very easy to observe values of the object as they change (and be notified of such changes). If you override the synthesized methods, you risk breaking that compliance.</li>

<p>So my question is, How do I get the <code>keyCodeForKeyString(currentCharacter)</code> inside the argument of <code>CGPostKeyboardEvent</code>?</p>
","115730","","<p>This can be a difficult problem, but not for the reason that @JWWalker states.</p>

<p>If you can easily convert keycodes to characters, then it is trivial to convert from a character to a keycode.  It's a 1-to-1 mapping between the two (a character has a single keycode, and a keycode has a single [sometimes non-printable] character), so you can easily build the transformation yourself.  The <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/shortcutrecorder"" rel=""nofollow"">ShortcutRecorder</a> project has an <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/shortcutrecorder/source/browse/trunk/Source/SRKeyCodeTransformer.m"" rel=""nofollow""><code>NSValueTransformer</code> subclass</a> that does this.</p>

<p>The difficulty is that posting keystrokes does not always result in a synchronous action.  Since you're (essentially) communicating to another process, you have no idea how long that process will take to handle your event posts and perform the appropriate action.  The time between ""posting"" and ""handling"" is indeterminate based on the current load and activity on the system.  <em>Usually</em> it happens fairly quickly (and in such a way as to appear mostly synchronous), but it doesn't have to be.  My particular example comes from dealing with the pasteboard server, which sometimes takes its very sweet time to respond to a <kbd>cmd</kbd>-<kbd>v</kbd> keystroke.</p>

<p>If all you're doing is mimicking typing, then that shouldn't be too bad.  You can get the <code>char*</code> of your string using <code>-[NSString UTF8String]</code> (or similar), then simply loop through the characters, convert them to keycodes, and post the appropriate events.</p>
"
"<p>I am writing the middleware for a cocoa application, and am debating over how exactly to design callbacks for many long running processes.</p>

<p>When the UI will call a function which executes for a long time, it needs to provide a delegate to allow at least:</p>

<ul>
<li>Report of Success (with return value)</li>
<li>Report of Failure (with error value)</li>
<li>Report of Progress (completed, expected total)</li>
</ul>

<p>I have tried a few techniques in the past, shown below</p>

<pre><code>@interface MyClass {
}

//Callback Option1, delgate conforming to protocol
-(void) longRunningProcess2:(id&lt;CallbackProtocol&gt;) delegate;

//Callback Option2, provide a delegate and allow it to provide selectors to callback
-(void) longRunningProcess3:(id) delegate success:(SEL) s1 failure:(SEL) s2 progress:(SEL) s3
@end
</code></pre>

<p>For Options 1, the question is then how to phrase the delegate response. The first way  I considered is (the function names are minimal for simplicity)</p>

<pre><code>//have a generic callback protocol for every function
@protocol CallbackProtocolGeneric
-(void) success:(id) returnValue;
-(void) failure:(NSError*) error;
@optional
-(void) progress:(NSInteger) completed of:(NSInteger) total;
@end

//have a separate protocol for every function
@protocol CallbackProtocolWithObjectAForOperation1
-(void) objectA:(ObjectA*) objectA operation1SucceedWithValue:(ReturnObject*) value;
-(void) objectA:(ObjectA*) objectA operation1FailedWithError:(NSError*) error;
@optional
-(void) objectA:(ObjectA*) objectA operation1didProgress:(NSInteger) completed of:(NSInteger) total;
@end
</code></pre>

<p>In my experience, 
<strong>Callback Option 1</strong> using a <strong>generic protocol</strong> was difficult to use because if a class wanted to be a callback for multiple operations it could not distinguish which callback it was receiving.</p>

<p><strong>Callback Option2</strong> was cumbersome to use and felt un-natural to use. Plus if the protocol was extended it would require modifying every call.</p>

<p><strong>Callback Option1</strong> using a <strong>specific protocol</strong> for each process seems to be the most readable and scalable method, however I wonder if making a new protocol for every single function is too verbose (Say a given object has 10+ such 'long operations', then 10 different protocols).</p>

<p>What conclusions have other people come to when implementing such designs?</p>

<p><strong>--edit:</strong>
In reply to Dave DeLong's answer</p>

<p>I have three classes which have 'long operations', non of the operations in each class or between classes are really related. Some are network resource requests, others are long processing requests. </p>

<p><strong>--edit:</strong>
A side note, I seem to have a problem where I cannot invoke run loop selectors for messages which have more than one argument. Is this a design limitation or is there a way around this?</p>

<p>For example I have a message such as
    -(id) someMessage:(id) value1 otherData:(id) value2 moreData:(id) value3</p>

<p>The performSelector functions which queue runLoop's do not support such selectors.</p>
","115730","","<p>I'd go with a single protocol route, similar to your <code>CallbackProtocolGeneric</code> option, except that I'd expand it to be more like:</p>

<pre><code>- (void) operation:(id)operation didFinishWithReturnValue:(id)returnValue;
- (void) operation:(id)operation didFailWithError:(NSError *)error;
- (void) operation:(id)operation hasCompleted:(NSInteger)progress ofTotal:(NSInteger)total;
</code></pre>

<p>So it's like option 1 in that you have a single protocol, but like option 2 in that you're passing back more information.  If necessary, you could expand this further with something like:</p>

<pre><code>- (void) operation:(id)operation didFinishStep:(NSInteger)stepNumber withReturnValue:(id)returnValue;
- (void) operation:(id)operation didFailStep:(NSInteger)stepNumber withError:(NSError *)error;
- (void) operation:(id)operation step:(NSInteger)step hasCompleted:(NSInteger)progress ofTotal:(NSInteger)total;
</code></pre>

<p>The ""step"" parameter could be some value that indicates which of the ""10+ long operations"" that this particular object is making.</p>

<p>Of course, this advice is very generic, since your question is also quite void of specific information, but this is probably the direction I'd go (without knowing more).</p>

However, <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/MemoryMgmt/MemoryMgmt.html"" rel=""nofollow"">the rule of memory management</a> is not that complicated.  It is:</p>

<p>If you were given an object via a method (or function) that contains the word <code>new</code>, <code>alloc</code>, <code>retain</code>, or <code>copy</code>, then you must either <code>release</code> the object or <code>autorelease</code> it.</p>

<p>That's pretty much it.  If you always follow this convention, then 99.999% of the time you're going to be OK.  The other 0.001% of the time, read the documentation (or ask us here on StackOverflow! :) ).</p>

<p>(I'll also add that anything the documentation says that contradicts this rule wins.)</p>
"
"<p>Is it safe to set an autoreleased object to nil? I know I don't need to release an autoreleased object but if I want the object to be released immediately to minimize memory use, can I set the object to nil?.</p>

<p>I may have read this somewhere a while back, but I can't remember where and I want to make sure that it is safe to do that.</p>
","115730","","<p>I think you're missing something pretty fundamental.  Setting an object to <code>nil</code> does nothing for you in terms of memory management.  Here's what's going on:<img src=""http://gallery.me.com/davedelong/100084/Pointers1/web.png?ver=12783505480001"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>In this image, you have the stack (where your local variables live; it's more or less synonymous to where you currently are in your code while executing).  If you declare something like <code>int bar = 42;</code>, then <code>bar</code> lives on the stack.  On the right you have the heap.  This is global memory space that belongs to your application.  The heap was invented to solve the problem of scope: how to make useful information live beyond the scope of the current function (or method).  When we <code>malloc</code> space, we are assigned a slot of memory on the heap.  When you <code>alloc/init</code> an object, that object lives on the heap.  In Objective-C, all objects live on the heap.*  So let's consider this line:</p>

<pre><code>MyObject * foo = [[MyObject alloc] init];
</code></pre>

<p>We really have 2 things going on.  The first is that we have allocated (<code>alloc</code>) a new chunk of space on the heap that's large enough to hold a <code>MyObject</code> structure.  Then we've taken the location of that chunk o' memory and assigned it into a local variable called <code>foo</code>.  In the image above, the reddish circle on the left is <code>foo</code>, and the reddish blob on the right is the actual <code>MyObject</code> (along with all of its data).  Make sense so far?</p>

<p>Here's what happens when you ""set an object to <code>nil</code>"" (<code>foo = nil;</code>)
<img src=""http://gallery.me.com/davedelong/100084/Pointers2/web.png?ver=12783505490001"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>You'll see that the object <em>still lives on the heap</em>.  In fact the only thing that has changed is that your local variable <code>foo</code> no longer points to the chunk of memory on the heap.  It points to <code>0</code> (<code>nil</code>, <code>NULL</code>, whatever you want to call it), which is how we indicate that ""this doesn't point to anything relevant any more"".</p>

<p>In a nutshell: <strong>setting a variable to nil has nothing to do with memory management</strong>.  If you want to get rid of an object immediately, then use <code>release</code> and not <code>autorelease</code>.  However, even then that's not a guaranteed ""destroy immediately"", since something else might be <code>retain</code>ing the object (which is <em>the whole point</em> of using the retain-release memory management model).</p>

<p>Beyond this, once you're done with an object (and after you've invoked either <code>release</code> or <code>autorelease</code>), it's still a good idea to set the variable to <code>nil</code>, just to avoid potential problems.  In Objective-C we can safe send messages to <code>nil</code> without things blowing up in our faces (unlike Java). However, if you don't ""nil out"" a variable, bad things can happen.  Let's say <code>foo</code> is pointing to a <code>MyObject</code> instance, and then the <code>MyObject</code> instance is destroyed (you <code>release</code>d it, but didn't set it to <code>nil</code>).  If you try to invoke a method on <code>foo</code> again, your app will crash.  If you do set <code>foo</code> to <code>nil</code>, then your app will continue on its merry way.  It might not <em>do</em> what you were hoping, but that's a different problem entirely.</p>

<p>Welcome to the wonderful world of Objective-C memory management.</p>

<p>* except for local blocks, but then only until they're copied.  There are some other caveats to this as well, but that's getting into the arcane.</p>

"<p>I am a new objective-c/iPhone developer and am wondering if there is any way to embed formatting tags into a string in plist? </p>

"<p>I am a great fan of code generation (from UML) and coming from the Java world, I wonder how I would implement automated bi-directional association management in Objective-C.</p>

<p>Image an association Partner &lt;-> Address, one-to-many and navigable from both ends. What I would like to achieve is that if I append an Address to a Partner that Address object should automatically know about its Partner.</p>

<p>So the implementation pattern would be to have an NSMutableArray* on the Partner side and a Partner* on the Address side. The property on the Address side is easy to implement, as a setPartner:(Partner*)aPartner could automatically insert the Address (self) into the Partner's NSMutableArray managing the addresses. The other side, however, is not so easy to implement. The standard implementation pattern for to-many references in Objective-C seems to be the NSMutableArray obtainable via the get method of the @property. The object in possession of this NSMutableArray could then insert an Address object into the array, which would of course not be updating the other side.</p>

<p>I know that there are other patterns for this kind of association management, for instance, via addTo...() and removeFrom...() methods. But I don't know yet if this would fit with other principles of Cocoa programming or even prevent me from using Cocoa efficiently. I am thinking about Interface Builder here. Not much experience, but I have seen something called an ArrayController which seems to be quite handy but which also seems to expect an NSMutableArray type property to work with. And if this guy inserts objects into the array I need to intercept that and make the other side adjustment.</p>

<p>As a Java programmer I would tend to subclass NSMutableArray now and override some of its methods which could then manipulate the other end. Would this be possible at all? I read about categories but so far I have understood that I could only <em>add</em> methods to a class this way and not override them nor add to the structure of it. Or should it be method forwarding? I am confused right now. If you could point me into the right direction of thinking it would be so great. Thanks a lot!</p>
","115730","","<p>Welcome to Cocoa.  Do not subclass built-in collections.  You will go insane.</p>

<p>Allow me to clarify: in Cocoa, we have these things called <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/Mac/library/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CocoaFundamentals/CocoaObjects/CocoaObjects.html#//apple%5Fref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH4-SW34"">""Class Clusters""</a>.  Clusters are a hierarchy of private classes that all have a common, public superclass.  In this case, <code>NSArray</code> is the public superclass, and there are private subclasses that are the actual array implementations.  This presents a really difficult challenge when subclassing, because you don't know what class (or classes) you would need to subclass.</p>

<p>The common work-around is to create a new <code>NSObject</code> subclass that ""wraps"" an <code>NSArray</code> (ie, it has the array as an instance variable [""field""]), and then you invoke methods on the custom wrapper, and the wrapper holds all the custom logic you need.</p>

<p>As to answer your question, I've found that when I have this sort of set up where I need to maintain one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many relationships automatically, there's nothing that beats using CoreData.  CoreData is a built-in framework that's more or less like an object store.  One of the truly awesome things that it does is handle relationship integrity, which is what you're looking for.</p>

"<p>I need to store two types of objects, <code>Feed</code> and <code>Folder</code>, in an array in Core Data. For example:</p>

<pre><code>Array
    Feed
    Feed
    Folder

    Folder
    Folder
    …etc...

<p>I know about <a href=""http://www.fatcatsoftware.com/blog/2008/per-object-ordered-relationships-using-core-data"" rel=""nofollow""><code>BWOrderedManagedObject</code></a> for storing objects in order in Core Data, but I'm not sure how to store mixed objects (the array needs to be mixed, since the items are in a specific order). Ideally, I'd have a relationship that pointed to two entities, but obviously this isn't possible.</p>

<p>The only solution I can see is to make the array a <code>Transformable</code> attribute. However, what about the objects stored within the array? Will I need to manage all of them myself or will they still be managed by Core Data?</p>
","115730","","<p>Here's how I've done it:</p>

<p><code>AbstractListItem</code> is an abstract entity that has the order property and a relationship to a <code>Folder</code>, which indicates the item's (single) parent.</p>

<p><code>Folder</code> is a concrete child of <code>AbstractListItem</code> that has a to-many relationship to <code>AbstractListItem</code>, which means the folder can have as many children as it wants that are <code>AbstractListItems</code> (so either <code>Folders</code> or <code>Feeds</code>).</p>

<p><code>Feeds</code> aren't anything special, except that they also inherit from <code>AbstractListItem</code> (meaning that they have an order and a parent, and can be children of a <code>Folder</code>).</p>

<p>So once you have a folder, you can get all of its children in order by doing something like:</p>

<pre><code>NSArray * orderedChildren = [[aFolder children] sortedArrayUsingDescriptors:[NSArray arrayWithObject:[NSSortDescriptor sortDescriptorWithKey:@""order"" ascending:YES]]];
</code></pre>

<p>To get your top-level items, you'd execute a fetch looking for all <code>AbstractListItem</code> objects where <code>parent = nil</code>.</p>

","115730","","<p>@KennyTM and @David are correct, but your code is potentially wrong.  Here's why:</p>

<p>When creating an <code>NSArray</code> with objects, it will <code>retain</code> the objects put into it.  In the case of blocks, it's using the <code>Block_retain</code> function.  This means that the array has retained the blocks that you created, but <em>that live on the stack</em> (blocks are one of the very rare examples of Objective-C objects that can be created on the stack without delving into absurd tricks).  That means that as soon as this method exits, your array now points to garbage, because the blocks it was pointing to <strong>no longer exist</strong>.  To do this properly, you should do:</p>

<pre><code>int (^Block_001)(void) = [^{ return 101; } copy];
int (^Block_002)(void) = [^{ return 202; } copy];
NSArray *array = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:Block_001, Block_002, nil];

[Block_001 release];
[Block_002 release];
</code></pre>

<p>By invoking <code>copy</code> on the block, you're explicitly moving the block off of the stack and onto the heap, where it can safely remain after the method/function exits.  Then after you've added the blocks to the array, you have to balance your <code>copy</code> (because of the NARC rule) with a subsequent call to <code>release</code>.  Make sense?</p>

","115730","","<p>Sensitive information should be stored in the keychain, a cryptographically secure location on the device.  If you save the username and/or password in <code>NSUserDefaults</code>, you're saving them as plaintext, which is inherently insecure.</p>

"<p>There is a <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1779034/nserror-domains-custom-domains-conventions-and-best-practices"">previous SO post</a> regarding setting up error domains for your own frameworks, but what is the best practice regarding setting up error domains and custom error codes <em>for your own project/app</em>?</p>

<p>For example, supposing you're working on a Core Data-intensive app with lots of validations, should you just stick with the ""off the shelf"" Core Data error codes (such as <code>NSManagedObjectValidationError</code> from <code>CoreDataErrors.h</code>) or should you create your own <code>MyAppErrors.h</code> and define errors with more specificity (i.e., <code>MyAppValidationErrorInvalidCombinationOfLimbs</code>?</p>

<p>Creating a custom error domain and set of error codes could significantly disambiguate your code, but is it too much overhead to maintain and does one have to worry about error code numbering conflicts?  Or are there other concerns here?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
","115730","","<p>I personally use a reverse-DNS style domain.  For example:</p>

<pre><code>NSError * myInternalError = [NSError errorWithDomain:@""com.davedelong.myproject"" code:42 userInfo:someUserInfo];
</code></pre>

<p>The third part of the domain (<code>@""myproject""</code>) is just used to differentiate the errors from this project (<code>""My Project""</code>) from errors in another project (<code>""My Other Project""</code> => <code>com.davedelong.myotherproject</code>).</p>

<p>It's a simple way to ensure that I'm not going to conflict with anyone else's error domains (if I'm using 3rd party code), unless that developer is purposefully trying to mess with <em>just</em> me (which I believe would be highly unlikely...).</p>

<p>As for code numbering conflicts, don't worry about that.  Just as long as codes are unique <em>within a domain</em>, you should be OK.</p>

<p>As for translating errors, that's up to you.  Whatever you do, make sure you document it well.  <em>Personally</em>, I usually just pass on framework-generated errors as they came to me, since I'm never quite sure that I'll handle all the codes and translate all of the userInfo into something more specific to my project.  The frameworks could change and add more codes, or change the meaning of existing codes, etc.  It also helps me more specifically identify where the error came from.  For example, if my <a href=""http://stackkit.com"">StackKit</a> framework generates an error in the <code>com.stackkit</code> domain, I know that it's a framework problem.  However, if it generates an error in the <code>NSURLErrorDomain</code>, then I know that it specifically came from the URL loading mechanism.</p>

<p>What you <em>could</em> do is capture the framework generated error and wrap it in a new error object that has your domain and a generic code, something like <code>kFrameworkErrorCodeUnknown</code> or something, and then place the captured error in the <code>userInfo</code> under the <code>NSUnderlyingErrorKey</code>.  CoreData does this a lot (for example, if you try to <code>save:</code> an <code>NSManagedObjectContext</code>, but you have relationship integrity errors, you'll get a single error back, but the <code>NSUnderlyingErrorKey</code> will contain much more information, like specifically which relationships are wrong, etc).</p>

<p>Both [] and . automatically dereference the pointer, correct? So anytime you are working with objects, you will always use pointers to reference those objects.</p>

<p>Will a variable ever be declared in Objective-C that does not have a pointer type?</p>
","115730","","<p>With one exception, all objects in Objective-C live exclusively on the heap, which means you will always be dealing with object references.</p>

<p>The one exception is blocks, which can be created on the stack and then subsequently moved to the heap using <code>Block_copy()</code>.  For example:</p>

<pre><code>dispatch_block_t myBlock = ^{
  NSLog(@""This is a block that lives on the stack"");
};
</code></pre>

<p>And due to how they're implemented, blocks can be treated as objects (ie, you can use them anywhere you could use an <code>id</code>).</p>

<p>Of course, any non-Objective-C objects can be created on the stack.  So if you're using Objective-C++, then you can create C++ objects on the stack (like normal), which means you'll be dealing with the object itself and not a reference.  Also, any primitive can be created on the stack (<code>int</code>, <code>char*</code>, a structure, etc).</p>

<p>So in a nutshell, if you're dealing with objects, then 99.999% of the time you'll be dealing with object references, and never the object itself.  Anything else is entirely up to you.</p>

    while ([[operationQueue operations] count] &gt; 0) {
        [[NSRunLoop currentRunLoop] runUntilDate:[NSDate dateWithTimeIntervalSinceNow:0.05]];

<p>Realistically though, what you're doing with the <code>waitUntilAllOperationsAreFinished</code> is about as good as you're going to get.  You could add another class that watches each operation and makes sure it doesn't run for too long (say 10x longer than you're expecting it to run), at which point it would <code>-cancel</code> the <code>NSOperation</code> (More or less your timer approach).  However, even that's not foolproof, because the operation could be blocked on something where you can't check for <code>-isCancelled</code> (inside a system call, for example).</p>

"<p>I have been reading about bit operators in Objective-C in Kochan's book, ""Programming in Objective-C"".</p>

<p>I am VERY confused about this part, although I have really understood most everything else presented to me thus far.</p>

<p>Here is a quote from the book:</p>

<p><strong>The Bitwise AND Operator</strong></p>

<p>Bitwise ANDing is frequently used for masking operations.  That is, this operator can be used easily to set specific bits of a data item to 0.  For example, the statement</p>

<pre><code>w3 = w1 &amp; 3;
</code></pre>

<p>assigns to w3 the value of w1 bitwise ANDed with the constant 3.  This has the same ffect of setting all the bits in w, other than the rightmost two bits to 0 and preserving the rightmost two bits from w1.</p>

<p>As with all binary arithmetic operators in C, the binary bit operators can also be used as assignment operators by adding an equal sign.  The statement</p>

<pre><code>word &amp;= 15;
</code></pre>

<p>therefore performs the same function as the following:</p>

<pre><code>word = word &amp; 15;
</code></pre>

<p>Additionally, it has the effect of setting all but the rightmost four bits of word to 0.  When using constants in performing bitwise operations, it is usually more convenient to express the constants in either octal or hexadecimal notation.</p>

<p>OK, so that is what I'm trying to understand.  Now, I'm extremely confused with pretty much this entire concept and I am just looking for a little clarification if anyone is willing to help me out on that.</p>

<p>When the book references ""setting all the bits"" now, all of the bits.. What exactly is a bit.  Isn't that just a 0 or 1 in 2nd base, in other words, binary?</p>

<p>If so, why, in the first example, are all of the bits except the ""rightmost 2"" to 0?  Is it 2 because it's 3 - 1, taking 3 from our constant?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","115730","","<p>Numbers can be expressed in binary like this:</p>

<pre><code>3    = 000011
5    = 000101
10   = 001010
</code></pre>

<p>...etc.  I'm going to assume you're familiar with binary.</p>

<p>Bitwise AND means to take two numbers, line them up on top of each other, and create a new number that has a 1 where both numbers have a 1 (everything else is 0).</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>    3          =&gt;  00011
  &amp; 5          =&gt;  00101
------           -------
    1              00001
</code></pre>

<p>Bitwise OR means to take two numbers, line them up on top of each other, and create a new number that has a 1 where either number has a 1 (everything else is 0). </p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>    3          =&gt;  00011
  | 5          =&gt;  00101
------           -------
    7              00111
</code></pre>

<p>Bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) means to take two numbers, line them up on top of each other, and create a new number that has a 1 where either number has a 1 AND the other number has a 0 (everything else is 0).</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>    3          =&gt;  00011
  ^ 5          =&gt;  00101
------           -------
    6              00110  
</code></pre>

<p>Bitwise NOR (Not OR) means to take the Bitwise OR of two numbers, and then reverse everything (where there was a 0, there's now a 1, where there was a 1, there's now a 0).</p>

<p>Bitwise NAND (Not AND) means to take the Bitwise AND of two numbers, and then reverse everything (where there was a 0, there's now a 1, where there was a 1, there's now a 0).</p>

<p>Continuing: why does <code>word &amp;= 15</code> set all but the 4 rightmost bits to 0?  You should be able to figure it out now...</p>

<pre><code>     n          =&gt;  abcdefghjikl
  &amp; 15          =&gt;  000000001111
------            --------------
     ?              00000000jikl
</code></pre>

<p>(<code>0 AND a = 0</code>, <code>0 AND b = 0</code>, ... <code>j AND 1 = j</code>, <code>i AND 1 = i</code>, ...)</p>

<p>How is this useful?  In many languages, we use things called ""bitmasks"".  A bitmask is essentially a number that represents a whole bunch of smaller numbers combined together.  We can combine numbers together using OR, and pull them apart using AND.  For example:</p>

<pre><code>int MagicMap = 1;
int MagicWand = 2;
int MagicHat = 4;
</code></pre>

<p>If I only have the map and the hat, I can express that as <code>myInventoryBitmask = (MagicMap | MagicHat)</code> and the result is my bitmask.  If I don't have anything, then my bitmask is 0.  If I want to see if I have my wand, then I can do:</p>

<pre><code>int hasWand = (myInventoryBitmask &amp; MagicWand);
if (hasWand &gt; 0) {
  printf(""I have a wand\n"");
} else {
  printf(""I don't have a wand\n"");
}
</code></pre>

<p>Get it?</p>

<p>EDIT: more stuff</p>

<p>You'll also come across the ""bitshift"" operator: &lt;&lt; and >>.  This just means ""shift everything left n bits"" or ""shift everything right n bits"".</p>

<p>In other words:</p>

<p><code>1 &lt;&lt; 3</code> = <code>0001 &lt;&lt; 3</code> = <code>0001000</code> = 8</p>

<p>And:</p>

<p><code>8 &gt;&gt; 2</code> = <code>01000 &gt;&gt; 2</code> = <code>010</code> = 2</p>

"<p>This is a bit complex.</p>

<p>I've created an array (NSArray) called pointsOfInterest.</p>

<p>The elements of this array are NSDictionary objects. Each dictionary has two keys, ""headerTitle"" and ""rowObjects."" The value for ""headerTitle"" is a simple NSString; the object for ""rowObjects"" is another NSArray of objects; each of these is a custom class.</p>

<p>See the code below.</p>

<pre><code>for (NSDictionary *dict in pointsOfInterest) {
    NSArray *keys = [dict allKeys];
    for (NSString *key in keys) {
        //NSLog(@""Key %@"",key);
    }       
    NSString *category = [dict valueForKey:@""headerTitle""];
    [poiCategories addObject:category];
}
</code></pre>

<p>So, I'm enumerating through the array, getting individual dictionary objects into dict. I then run through all of its keys - if I uncommented the NSLog line, it would display something like this:</p>

<pre><code>2010-08-06 14:00:17.236 TourGuide[4479:207] Key headerTitle
2010-08-06 14:00:17.237 TourGuide[4479:207] Key rowObjects
2010-08-06 14:00:17.238 TourGuide[4479:207] Key headerTitle
2010-08-06 14:00:17.239 TourGuide[4479:207] Key rowObjects
</code></pre>

<p>It then constructs a new, flat array, containing the values from all of the ""headerTitle"" keys. </p>

<p>First, I'm well aware that I should be able to do this:</p>

<pre><code>poiCategories = [[pointsOfInterest valueForKey:@""headerTitle""] retain]
</code></pre>

<p>And get the values for the various ""headerTitle"" keys. Doing that, however, crashes the app. What's weird, is that the above for construct works fine... IF I leave in the internal for loop. If I remove that for loop, and its useless NSLog, leaving just this:</p>

<pre><code>for (NSDictionary *dict in pointsOfInterest) {
    NSString *category = [dict valueForKey:@""headerTitle""];
    [poiCategories addObject:category];
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then it crashes. It does not grace me with any kind of trappable error that I can find. </p>

<p>Any reason anyone can think of?</p>
","115730","","<p><strong>edit</strong> Louis pointed out in one of the comments that <code>-[NSDictionary valueForKey:]</code> will forward on to <code>objectForKey:</code> unless the key begins with <code>@</code>.  <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSDictionary_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000140-BBCIBCDJ"" rel=""nofollow"">Source</a>  However, I'd still change it to use <code>objectForKey:</code> just for semantic clarity.</p>

<p>Use <code>objectForKey:</code> instead of <code>valueForKey:</code>.  They have very different semantics and implementations.  <code>valueForKey:@""headerTitle""</code> will look for an <code>NSDictionary</code> method called <code>headerTitle</code> and return the result of that method (or if it doesn't exist, will likely crash), whereas <code>objectForKey:</code> actually goes and looks stuff up in the dictionary's hash table structure to find the object you're looking for.</p>

"<p>The table I'm having problem with is pushed from another table controller, and there is only one section in this table, and I'm using custom cells. Here is the code for numberOfRowsInSection:</p>

<pre><code>- (NSInteger)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView numberOfRowsInSection:(NSInteger)section {
NSInteger numberOfRows;
if ([imagesArray count] == 0) {
    numberOfRows = 0;
}
else {
    if ([imagesArray count] % 4 == 0) {
        numberOfRows = [imagesArray count] / 4;
    }
    else {
        numberOfRows = ([imagesArray count] / 4) + 1;
    }
}
NSLog(@""numberOfRowsInSection: %d"", numberOfRows);
return numberOfRows;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The log here always prints the expected number of rows. So far so good. Now let's take a look at cellForRowAtIndexPath:</p>

<pre><code>- (UITableViewCell *)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView cellForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath {
    NSLog(@""cellForRowAtIndexPath: %@"", [indexPath description]);

    ImageTableCell *cell = (ImageTableCell *)[tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier:@""4ImagesCell""];
    if (cell == nil) {
            cell = [[[ImageTableCell alloc] initWithStyle:UITableViewCellStyleValue1 reuseIdentifier:@""4ImagesCell""] autorelease];
    }
    return cell;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The console here ""always"" prints the following:</p>

<pre><code>cellForRowAtIndexPath: &lt;NSIndexPath 0x5a4f2c0&gt; 2 indexes [0, 0]
cellForRowAtIndexPath: &lt;NSIndexPath 0x5a4f2c0&gt; 2 indexes [0, 1]
cellForRowAtIndexPath: &lt;NSIndexPath 0x5a4f2c0&gt; 2 indexes [0, 2]
cellForRowAtIndexPath: &lt;NSIndexPath 0x5a4f2c0&gt; 2 indexes [0, 3]
cellForRowAtIndexPath: &lt;NSIndexPath 0x5a4f2c0&gt; 2 indexes [0, 4]
</code></pre>

<p>No matter what the value returned by numberOfRowsInSection is, whether it is a Zero or a 100, the table always asks for 5 rows! I even tried returning a static number in numberOfRowsInSection instead of the current conditions, but it makes no difference for the actual number of cells!</p>

<p>What drives me crazy is that the table does reach the numberOfRowsInSection method before going to cellForRowAtIndexPath! </p>

<p>The only thing I can think of that maybe causing this is that this table controller is pushed from another UITableViewController, but the previous table's numberOfRowsInSection method is never checked while I'm in this table, I even tried to modify the number of rows in the parent table without any luck.</p>

<p>If there is any kind of info missing please let me know. The project is quit complicated and I can't think of any other relevant info for this problem.</p>

<p>//  ------ Update -----</p>

<p>Thank you for everyone reply.</p>

<p>Actually, the array contains the objects of the elements, but I can convent it all to the array like the following (I guess it is more easy to do this).</p>

<p>The array is NSMutableArray *csvArray and the array contains data, like the following example.</p>

<pre><code>csvArray[0] = First Name
csvArray[1] = Last Name
csvArray[2] = Phone
csvArray[3] = Tom
csvArray[4] = Chan
csvArray[5] = 123
csvArray[6] = Peter
csvArray[7] = Wong
csvArray[8] = 456
csvArray[9] = Mary's
csvArray[10] = Cho""w
csvArray[11] = 789...
</code></pre>

<p>There are 3 tabs in the begin of the array, which is first name, last name and the phone. For the data, it also contains the "" and , symbol. Therefore, I cannot just cut the array by the ',' symbol. </p>

<p>The format I would like to output is the following</p>

<pre><code>//---------------------------

First Name, Last Name, Phone  // &lt;- it have the \r\n between each row of data
Tom, Chan, 123
Peter, Wong, 456
Mary's, Cho""w, 789 ...

//---------------------------
</code></pre>
","115730","","<p>The CSV parser I wrote (<a href=""http://github.com/davedelong/CHCSVParser"">http://github.com/davedelong/CHCSVParser</a>) can parse CSV files into an NSArray of NSArrays (if you use the NSArray category included with the code), and I just added a method to the category to take one of those arrays and write it back to a CSV file.</p>

<p>So if you have an <code>NSArray</code> of <code>NSArrays</code>, then you can write it to a CSV file like this:</p>

<pre><code>[myArray writeToCSVFile:myCSVFile atomically:YES];
</code></pre>

<p>If will gracefully fail if you do not pass an NSArray of NSArrays.</p>

<p><strong>edit</strong> (prompted by @Aran's comment to the question) any object inside the subarrays will have its <code>-description</code> method written to the CSV file.  If you want to write a series of objects to the file, with various properties as the fields of the CSV row, then my wrapper requires that the properties be placed in an array, and then that array will make up the row.</p>

<p><strong>edit #2</strong> I just updated my CSV parser to refactor the writing into it's own class. You can now do the following:</p>

<pre><code>CHCSVWriter * csvWriter = [[CHCSVWriter alloc] initWithCSVFile:outputFile atomic:NO];
NSInteger numberOfColumns = 3;
for (NSInteger currentIndex = 0; currentIndex &lt; [csvArray count]; currentIndex++) {
  id field = [csvArray objectAtIndex:currentIndex];
  [csvWriter writeField:field];
  if ((currentIndex % numberOfColumns) == (numberOfColumns - 1)) {
    [csvWriter writeLine];
  }
}
[csvWriter release];
</code></pre>

<p>That will write your <code>csvArray</code> to the file whose path is <code>outputFile</code>, and the file will look like:</p>

<pre><code>First Name,Last Name,Phone
Tom,Chan,123
Peter,Wong,456

Once you have relinquished ownership of an object, either by invoking <code>release</code> or <code>autorelease</code>, then it is invalid (bad practice) to send more messages to that object.  In your example, you <code>alloc</code> an <code>NSBundle</code>, so you own it.  That means it has a +1 retain count (I say +1, because it's relative).  When you release the bundle, it now has a ""0"" retain count, which means you no longer own this object (despite whether or not it may still exist in memory), which means you should <em>not</em> send messages to it, under penalty of stuff blowing up in your face.</p></li>
<li><p>What's recommended is to use whatever's appropriate for the situation.  If you just need a temporary object, then using a class method that returns an autoreleased object is probably going to be just fine.  If you need to be absolutely sure that the object isn't going to go away while you're using it, then you can use an <code>alloc</code>/<code>init</code> approach (or <code>retain</code> an autoreleased object) and then just <code>release</code> it when you're done.</p></li>

"<p>I drained an autorelease pool. The warning <code>*** attempt to pop an unknown autorelease pool</code> means the autorelease pool was created and drained in different methods - that's fine.</p>

<p>But does it mean such pool is NOT being drained?
Is there a solution?</p>
","115730","","<p>@itaiferber is incorrect, as is the Dev Blog post he links to.</p>

<p>NSAutoreleasePools are <em>not</em> created on the Stack.  They are allocated on the heap, just like all other Cocoa objects.</p>

<p>I think where the confusion comes from is that in the documentation it says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Each thread (including the main thread) maintains its own stack of NSAutoreleasePool objects (see “Threads”). As new pools are created, they get added to the top of the stack. When pools are deallocated, they are removed from the stack.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The ""stack"" referred to in the documentation is not the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack"" rel=""nofollow"">call stack</a>, but a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_%28data_structure%29"" rel=""nofollow"">stack data structure</a>.  This means that if you have ""autorelease pool 1"", and then create a second autorelease pool, and then autorelease an object, the object will be released when the second autorelease pool is drained.</p>

<p>In summary: you are perfectly welcome to create an autorelease pool in one method and drain it in another, as long as you understand the memory implications of doing so.  (Whether or not this is bad design is another question entirely)</p>

<p>If you end up not draining the pool, <em>it will be drained for you</em> when a parent autorelease pool is drained.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you release an autorelease pool that is not the top of the stack, this causes all (unreleased) autorelease pools above it on the stack to be released, along with all their objects. If you neglect to send release to an autorelease pool when you are finished with it (something not recommended), it is released when one of the autorelease pools in which it nests is released.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So if your autorelease pool stack looks like:</p>

<pre><code> _____
|  1  |  &lt;--- most recently allocated pool
|-----|
|  2  |
|-----|
|  3  |  &lt;--- least recently allocated pool
 -----
</code></pre>

<p>And you then drain pool 3, pools 2 and 1 will automatically be drained as well.  I'm guessing this is what's happening in your code.  You're creating ""pool 1"", and then it's getting automatically drained when ""pool 3"" gets drained, and then you're attempting to drain pool 1 yourself, but it's no longer valid, and you are ""attempting to pop an unknown autorelease pool"".</p>

<p>This problem because especially apparent if you're trying to hang on to autorelease pools in a GUI application.  In such applications (UIKit or AppKit based), the run loop will create and destroy an autorelease pool on every pass of the loop, which means that any autorelease pool you create during an iteration of the loop will be destroyed the next time the loop comes around.</p>

<p>For much more specific information on this, there's <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/cocoa/Conceptual/MemoryMgmt/Articles/mmAutoreleasePools.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000047-997594-EGGBFFED"" rel=""nofollow"">an entire section</a> of the Memory Management Programming Guide devoted to autorelease pools.</p>

"<p>I came across a problem that seems to be called ""drowning"" in autorelease pools.</p>

<p>My code creates and destroys objects correctly. However, I use some class methods that autorelease several variables without my knowing about it. Considering they loop thousands and thousands of times every minute... I find myself drowning in thousands of unreleased objects lost somewhere in the program.</p>

<p>2 questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>So either I do not use class methods AT ALL - is that a permanent solution, or, even so, will some instance methods (Foundation, UIKit) still autorelease objects without my knowing about it?</p></li>
<li><p>or I can alloc an autorelease pool prior to calling class methods and draining it after calling the class methods - would this be a permanent solution?</p></li>
</ol>
","115730","","<ol>
<li><p>Just because you don't use a class method doesn't mean you're going to avoid autoreleased objects.  For example:  <code>NSString * path = [anotherString stringByAppendingPathComponent:@""foo""]</code> returns an autoreleased object, yet no class methods were involved.  As far as I know, the only way to avoid autoreleased objects is to not use objects.  If you <em>really</em> want to go that route, check out CoreFoundation.  (I do not recommend going that route.)</p></li>
<li><p>If you do have some crazy factory method that creates tons of autorelease pools, then I'd probably do something like this:</p>

<pre>+ (id) crazyFactoryMethodWithFoo:(id)foo {
  NSAutoreleasePool * pool = [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init];
  id returnValue = nil;
  //generate gobs of autoreleased objects
  returnValue = [something retain];
  [pool release];
  return [returnValue autorelease];
}</pre>

<p>By explicitly retaining the return value before draining the pool, you ensure that the return value will live beyond the destruction of the autorelease pool.  You then balance that <code>retain</code> by autoreleasing the return value and returning it.</p></li>

","115730","","<p>@Ahruman's answer is correct, if you're dealing with objects.  Let me suggest some alternatives:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>valueForKey:</code>:  If you use <code>[myObject valueForKey:@""myPropertyName""]</code>, it will return an object.  If the property corresponds to some sort of primitive (<code>int</code>, <code>float</code>, <code>CGRect</code>, etc), then it will be boxed for you into an <code>NSNumber</code> or <code>NSValue</code> (as appropriate).  If it comes back as an <code>NSNumber</code>, you can then easily extract a double representation (<code>doubleValue</code>) and use that as an <code>NSTimeInterval</code> to create an <code>NSDate</code>.  I would probably recommend this approach.</li>
<li><p>Special case each type.  <code>property_getAttributes()</code> returns a <code>char*</code> representing all of the attributes of the property, and you can extract the type by doing this:</p>

<pre>const char * type = property_getAttributes(class_getProperty([self class], ""myPropertyName""));
NSString * typeString = [NSString stringWithUTF8String:type];
NSArray * attributes = [typeString components separatedByString:@"",""];
NSString * typeAttribute = [attributes objectAtIndex:0];
NSString * propertyType = [typeAttribute substringFromIndex:1];
const char * rawPropertyType = [propertyType UTF8String];

if (strcmp(rawPropertyType, @encode(float)) == 0) {
  //it's a float
} else if (strcmp(rawPropertyType, @encode(int)) == 0) {
  //it's an int
} else if (strcmp(rawPropertyType, @encode(id)) == 0) {
  //it's some sort of object
} else ....</pre>

<p>This is pedantically more correct than Louis's answer, because while <em>most</em> types have a single-character encoding, <em>they don't have to</em>.  (his suggestion assumes a single-character encoding)</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, if you're doing this on a subclass of <code>NSManagedObject</code>, then I would encourage checking out <code>NSPropertyDescription</code>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>From these alternatives, you can probably see that letting the runtime box the value for you is probably simplest.</p>

<p><strong>edit</strong> extracting the type:</p>

<p>From the code above, you can extract the class name like so:</p>

<pre><code>if ([typeAttribute hasPrefix:@""T@""] &amp;&amp; [typeAttribute length] &gt; 1) {
  NSString * typeClassName = [typeAttribute substringWithRange:NSMakeRange(3, [typeAttribute length]-4)];  //turns @""NSDate"" into NSDate
  Class typeClass = NSClassFromString(typeClassName);
  if (typeClass != nil) {
    [object setValue:[self convertValue:self.value toType:typeClass] forKey:element];
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And then instead of using class method categories to do the conversion (ie, <code>[NSDate convertToDate:]</code>), make a method on <code>self</code> that does that for you and accepts the desired type as a parameter.  You could (for now) do it like:</p>

<pre><code>- (id) convertValue:(id)value toType:(Class)type {
  if (type == [NSDate class]) {
    return [NSDate convertToDate:value];
  } else if (type == [NSString class]) {
    return [NSString convertToString:value];
  } ...

What would anyone suggest to do in a situation like this where I need to add UIImages to an NSMutableDictionary from a thread? Thanks so much!</p>

<p>Here's the NSOperation code I use:<br></p>

<pre><code>- (void)main {
    NSString *filePath = [applicaitonAPI getFilePathForCachedImageWithID:imageID andSize:imageSize];
    UIImage *returnImage = [[UIImage alloc] initWithContentsOfFile:filePath];

    if (returnImage) {
        NSMutableDictionary *dict = [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] initWithCapacity:2];
        [dict setObject:returnImage forKey:@""IMAGE""];
        [dict setValue:[NSString stringWithFormat:@""%d"", imageID] forKey:@""IMAGE_ID""];
        NSDictionary *returnDict = [[NSDictionary alloc] initWithDictionary:dict];
        [dict release];
        [mainViewController performSelectorOnMainThread:@selector(imageLoaderLoadedImage:) withObject:returnDict waitUntilDone:NO];
        [returnDict release];
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And here's the method on the main thread:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)imageLoaderLoadedImage:(NSDictionary *)dict {
  UIImage *loadedImage = [dict objectForKey:@""IMAGE""];
  NSString *loadedImage = [dict valueForKey:@""IMAGE_ID""];
  [imagesInMemoryDictionary setObject:loadedImage forKey:loadedImageID];
  [self drawItemsToScrollView];
}
</code></pre>

<p>You're not passing <code>returnDict</code> as the parameter to the method.  You're passing <code>nil</code>.</p>

<p>A couple of other thoughts:</p>

<ul>
<li>you don't need to create <code>returnDict</code>.  You can just use <code>dict</code> as the method parameter.</li>
<li>you're leaking <code>returnImage</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>edit</strong></p>

<p>Since you apparently <em>are</em> passing <code>returnDict</code> as the parameter to the method, my other guess would be that <code>mainViewController</code> is <code>nil</code>.  Other than that, your code looks functional.</p>

","115730","","<p>@Peter Hosey is absolutely correct: the way to do this is the SQLite binding functions.

"<p>Hey.  I am reading in a string from a file and attempting to use the resulting string to set a BOOL property on an object using the KVC method <code>-setValue:forKeyPath:</code>.  However, this breaks with an exception: <code>-[NSCFString charValue]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x7fff711023b0</code>.  I'm guessing this is because BOOL is typedef'd from char.

","115730","","<p>No, you cannot autorelease it.  Autoreleasing is only available for Objective-C objects.  So you have 2 options:</p>

<ol>
<li>Free the memory yourself using <code>free()</code>.</li>
<li>Wrap the <code>s</code> thing into an <code>NSData</code> using <code>dataWithBytesNoCopy:length:</code>, which will take ownership of the allocated data and free it when the <code>NSData</code> object is deallocated.</li>
</ol>

<p>Option 2 would look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>unz_s * s = unzOpen2(...);
NSData * boxedS = [NSData dataWithBytesNoCopy:s length:sizeof(unz_s)];

<p>Then when <code>boxedS</code> gets destroyed, it will free <code>s</code> as well.</p>

","115730","","<h1>Problem #1</h1>

<p>Something that immediately strikes me as wrong are the first two lines:</p>

<pre><code>NSString *post = @""email-email=test@email.com&amp;password-password=testpassword"";
NSData *postData = [post dataUsingEncoding:NSASCIIStringEncoding allowLossyConversion:YES];
</code></pre>

<p>When submitting POST forms (and GET parameters in the URL), only the keys and the values should be URL encoded.  Here you're not only encoding the keys and the values, but also the <code>=</code> and <code>&amp;</code>, which is just plain wrong.  I usually do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>NSMutableDictionary * parameters = [NSMutableDictionary dictionary];
[parameters setObject:@""test@email.com"" forKey:@""email-email""];
[parameters setObject:@""testpassword"" forKey:@""password-password""];

NSMutableArray * encodedParameters = [NSMutableArray array];
for (NSString * key in parameters) {
  NSString * value = [parameters objectForKey:key];
  NSString * encoded = [NSString stringWithFormat:@""%@=%@"", [key stringByAddingPercentEscapesUsingEncoding:NSASCIIStringEncoding], [value stringByAddingPercentEscapesUsingEncoding:NSASCIIStringEncoding]];
  [encodedParameters addObject:encoded];
}

NSString * post = [encodedParameters componentsJoinedByString:@""&amp;""];
NSData * postData = [post dataUsingEncoding:NSASCIIStringEncoding];
</code></pre>

<p>You may also run into problems using <code>stringByAddingPercentEscapesUsingEncoding:</code>.  I wrote an <code>NSString</code> category on how to URL encode strings <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3423545/objective-c-iphone-percent-encode-a-string/3426140#3426140"">here</a>.</p>

<h1>Problem #2</h1>

<p>You're never waiting for the connection to send.  <code>NSURLConnection</code>, in the way that you're using it, is an <em>asynchronous</em> API.  Thus, the following will fail:</p>

<pre><code>NSURLConnection *theConnection = [[NSURLConnection alloc] initWithRequest:request delegate:self];
if (theConnection) {
  NSLog(@""Connection succeeded!"");
}
</code></pre>

<p>What you're testing there is not the successful completion of the connection, but the successful <em>instantiation of a connection object</em>.  That's a very very different thing.  The connection itself may not actually finish for several spins of the run loop.  If you want the connection to be synchronous (ie, the connection is done before the next line of code is executed), then you need to use <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSURLConnection_Class/Reference/Reference.html""><code>NSURLConnection</code>'s synchronous API</a>.</p>

<h1>Problem #3</h1>

<p>These lines are full of fail:</p>

<pre><code>receivedData = [[NSMutableData data] retain];
NSString *text = [[NSString alloc] initWithData:receivedData encoding:NSASCIIStringEncoding];
</code></pre>

<p><code>[NSMutableData data]</code> returns an empty data object.  <em>It contains nothing</em>.  So if you create an empty data object, and then create a string out of the data, then (surprise surprise) you're going to get an empty string.</p>

<p>Plus you're leaking the data object (since you <code>retain</code> it [which is unnecessary], but never <code>release</code> it).</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong> since I'm feeling generous....</p>

<p>The following works properly (although I just hardcoded the HTTPBody string instead of building it as recommended above):</p>

<pre><code>NSURL * url = [NSURL URLWithString:@""http://www.lockerz.com/auth/login/""];
NSMutableURLRequest * r = [[NSMutableURLRequest alloc] initWithURL:url];
[r setHTTPMethod:@""POST""];
[r setHTTPBody:[@""email%2Demail=test%40email%2Ecom&amp;password%2Dpassword=testpassword"" dataUsingEncoding:NSASCIIStringEncoding]];
[r setValue:@""application/x-www-form-urlencoded"" forHTTPHeaderField:@""Content-Type""];

NSHTTPURLResponse * response = nil;
NSError * error = nil;
NSData * responseData = [NSURLConnection sendSynchronousRequest:r returningResponse:&amp;response error:&amp;error];
NSString * responseString = [[[NSString alloc] initWithData:responseData encoding:NSASCIIStringEncoding] autorelease];
NSLog(@""%@"", responseString);
[r release];
</code></pre>

<p>This correctly executes, and the <code>responseString</code> logs some HTML which describes an error page.  This, however, is unsurprising, since the URL itself (http://www.lockerz.com/auth/login) produces an error when attempting to use the credentials provided in the original question.</p>

"<p>This makes no sense to me.  Maybe someone here can explain why this happens.</p>

<p>I've got an NSMutableString that I alloc at the top of my iPhone app, then append to later in the process.  It results in a SIGABRT, which doesn't add up to me.  Here's the code:</p>

<p>Header File (simplified):</p>

<pre><code>@interface MyAppDelegate : NSObject &lt;UIApplicationDelegate&gt; {
    UIWindow *window;
    NSMutableString *locationErrorMessage;
}

@property (nonatomic, retain) IBOutlet UIWindow *window;
@property (nonatomic, copy) NSMutableString *locationErrorMessage;

@end
</code></pre>

<p>And the relevant parts of the Main:</p>

<pre><code>@implementation MyAppDelegate

@synthesize window;
@synthesize locationErrorMessage;

- (void)applicationDidFinishLaunching:(UIApplication *)application {
    self.locationErrorMessage = [[NSMutableString alloc] init];  
}

- (void)anotherFunction {
    [self.locationErrorMessage appendString: @""Blah Blah Blah""];
}
</code></pre>

<p>This all seems simple enough.  What am I missing?</p>
","115730","","<p>I would call this a bug in how property setters are generated, but the answer is pretty simple:</p>

<p>You declared the property as <code>(nonatomic, copy)</code>.  This means that whenever the <code>locationErrorMessage</code> property is set, it's going to invoke <code>copy</code> on the new value and use that copy as the property value.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, invoking <code>copy</code> on an <code>NSMutableString</code> does not result in an <code>NSMutableString</code>, it results in an <code>NSString</code> (which cannot be mutated using something like <code>appendString:</code>).</p>

<p>So the simple fix would be to change the property declaration from <code>copy</code> to <code>retain</code>.</p>

<p>(I would say that the bug would be:  If you declare a property for a mutable object as <code>copy</code>, then the copy setter should actually use <code>mutableCopy</code> and not <code>copy</code>) => rdar://8416047</p>

I have added a textview on top of the button (n1, n2...) that now displays my random numbers instead.<br>

<p>Please can you answer this!</p>

<p>Your help is really appreciated,</p>

","115730","","<p>Well, the biggest hurdle I see is that you're probably going to need a custom property on <code>Class</code> objects which you could use as the key of an <code>NSSortDescriptor</code>.  Unfortunately, there's no real way to add methods/categories to <code>Class</code> objects.</p>

<p>So what I would probably do is use <code>NSStringFromClass()</code> to convert your <code>Class</code> objects into strings, then use an <code>NSString</code> category to add a custom comparator method (something like <code>compareToClass:</code>) that converts the string back to a <code>Class</code>, does the subclass determination, and then returns the appropriate ordering constant.</p>

<p>From there, you can use <code>NSArray</code>'s <code>sortedArrayUsingSelector:</code> method to get them in order.</p>

","115730","","<p>Sure.  The way you can do it is serialize your dictionary into an <code>NSData</code> object using <code>NSPropertyListSerialization</code>, and then write your data object out to your <code>NSInputStream</code>.</p>

<p>Correct me if I am wrong, in the implementation of <code>CGPointMake</code>, <code>CGPoint p;</code> declare a local variable of a <code>struct</code>, which should should be freed after leaving the scope. But why the function can return the value without risk?</p>

<p>Anyway, assume that implementation of <code>CGPointMake</code> is correct, should I free the CGPoint that created by <code>CGPointMake</code>?</p>
","115730","","<p>It doesn't need to be freed, because it never lived on the heap.  Only heap-allocated memory needs to be freed.  Memory that is allocated on the stack (as is done in <code>CGPointMake()</code>) will be cleaned up automatically after the method/function exists.</p>

<p>The function can return a point because the compiler sees ""Aha, this function wants to return a struct, which is <code>sizeof(CGPoint)</code> bytes big, so I'll make sure that there's enough space in the return value memory slot for something that big.""  Then as the function exits, the return value is copied in to the return memory slot, the function exits, and the value in the return slot is copied over to its new destination.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I'm only interested in the file that gets run first from the classes folder</p>

<p>The simple answer is ""The application delegate"", then everything else.</p>

<p>The technical answer to that is that any objects in your MainMenu.xib (Mac) or MainWindow.xib (iOS) file will be instantiated first.  Usually the objects in that file will be instantiated in the order in which they appear, but I don't think that's guaranteed.</p>

<p>So if you 3 have custom top-level objects in your MainWindow.xib file, then they'll all be instantiated at the same time (within reason).  First their <code>initWithCoder:</code> methods will execute, then some time later their <code>awakeFromNib</code> methods will execute (which usually the safest ""starting point"" for that object).</p>

<p>The application delegate launch methods will happen somewhere along in there too (I believe in between <code>initWithCoder:</code> and <code>awakeFromNib</code>).</p>

"<p>I have an NSDictionary in which I use my own classes (NSObject subclasses) as keys and would like to make sure that I do not include the same key twice. However, because NSDictionary copies its keys, if I try to check whether an object is in the dictionary, it never thinks it is.
For example,</p>

<pre><code>MyClass* obj = [[MyClass alloc] init];
NSMutableDictionary* dict = [NSMutableDictionary dictionary];
[dict setObject:someObj forKey:obj];
if ([[dict allKeys] contains:obj]) // always returns false
    // obj is already in dict
else
    // add obj to dict etc.

[dict setObject:someObj forKey:obj];
// dict: { 'MyClass : 0x2' = someObjDesc }
[dict setObject:someOtherObj forKey:obj];
// dict: { 'MyClass : 0x2' = someObjDesc , 'MyClass : 0x3' = someOtherObjDesc }

<p>Background (in case it turns out that maybe I'm just using the wrong thing entirely):
I want to keep track of information about a group of people going to different places. So each person at each place has some info. What I've done is used nested dictionaries so the key to the main dictionary is a Person object and the object another dictionary. This latter dictionary has key Place and info as the object. I think this is Java syntax but something like > (the array holds the info). I want to be able to add a Person only if the don't already exist, add a Place (for each person), change the array.</p>

<p>Now, the problem is that when I release the class the timer goes on and on and on firing the event anyway. Am I doing something wrong?

"<p>can I get the list of messages that one object can response in runtime? (in Cocoa).</p>
","115730","","<p>@Wooble's answer is correct.  An object can choose to respond to a message or not, and you can even add/remove/swap methods at runtime.</p>

<p>If you want to get a list of methods that an object currently implements (note: this is different than what messages an object will respond to), you can do so like this:</p>

<pre><code>#import &lt;objc/runtime.h&gt;

Class class = [MyClass class];
unsigned int numMethods = 0;
Method * methods = class_copyMethodList(class, &amp;numMethods);
for (int i = 0; i &lt; numMethods; ++i) {
  SEL methodSelector = method_getName(methods[i]);
  NSLog(@""%@"", NSStringFromSelector(methodSelector));
}
free(methods);
</code></pre>

<p>This is pretty neat, but be aware that this will only give you the instance methods <em>implemented</em> by the class.  In other words, it will <em>not</em> give you the methods inherited from a superclass.  To get those methods, you must inspect the superclass directly.</p>

<p>If you want to get all of the <em>class</em> methods implemented by a specific class, then you replace:</p>

<pre><code>Class class = [MyClass class]:
</code></pre>

<p>with:</p>

<pre><code>Class class = objc_getMetaClass(class_getName([MyClass class]));

"<p>I am playing around with Dave DeLong's excellent <a href=""http://github.com/davedelong/CHCSVParser"" rel=""nofollow"">CHCSVParser</a> for Objective-C with an extremely long .CSV file and am running into some trouble using it.

<p>Thanks!</p>
","115730","","<p>I'm glad to see that my code is proving useful! :)</p>

<p><code>CHCSVParser</code> is similar in behavior to an <code>NSXMLParser</code>, in that every time it finds something interesting, it's going to let you know via one of the delegate callbacks.  However, if you choose to ignore the data that it gives you in the callback, then it's gone.  These parsers (<code>CHCSVParser</code> and <code>NSXMLParser</code>) are pretty stupid.  They just know the format of the stuff they're trying to parse, but don't really do much beyond that.</p>

<p>So the answer, in a nutshell, is ""you have to save it yourself"".  If you look at the code for the <code>NSArray</code> category, you'll see in the .m file that it's using <a href=""http://github.com/davedelong/CHCSVParser/blob/master/NSArray%2BCHCSVAdditions.m#L30"">a simple <code>NSObject</code> subclass as the parser delegate</a>, and that subclass is what's aggregating the fields into an array, and then adding that array to the overall array.  You'll need to do something similar.</p>

<p>Example delegate:</p>

<pre><code>@interface CSVParserDelegate : NSObject &lt;CHCSVParserDelegate&gt; {
  NSMutableArray * currentRow;
}
@end

@implementation CSVParserDelegate

- (void) parser:(CHCSVParser *)parser didStartLine:(NSUInteger)lineNumber {
  currentRow = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init];
}
- (void) parser:(CHCSVParser *)parser didReadField:(NSString *)field {
  [currentRow addObject:field];
}
- (void) parser:(CHCSVParser *)parser didEndLine:(NSUInteger)lineNumber {
  NSLog(@""finished line! %@"", currentRow);
  [self doSomethingWithLine:currentRow];
  [currentRow release], currentRow = nil;
}
@end
</code></pre>

<p>However, I could be convinced to modify the behavior of the parser to aggregate the row itself, but if I go down that route, why not just have the parser aggregate the entire file? (Answer: it shouldn't)</p>

Now, I'm sure I've made some stupid error somewhere, probably related to releasing an object or an observer or what-not, but since I can't seem to find a way to debug the code I thought I could use the NSDebugEnabled, NSZombieEnabled and MallocStackLogging (as shown <a href=""http://www.cocoadev.com/index.pl?DebuggingAutorelease"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>). </p>

<p>Can it be done using OCUnit? If so, how? I just can't find an ""executable"" to set these parameters on... </p>

<p>Thanks!
Aviad.</p>
","115730","","<p>Well, <code>NSZombieEnabled</code> and friends are environment variables, which means they have to be run on an executable.  The default setup for a unit testing bundle is for the tests to be run during the <em>build</em> process, and not during execution.</p>

<p>So the way to fix this is to make it so that your tests don't run during the build phase, but instead run them as part of an executable.</p>

<p>Here's how I do that:</p>

<ol>
<li>Inside your Unit Test bundle target, remove the ""Run Script"" build phase.  It's that step that executes the tests after compiling them.</li>
<li>From the Project menu, choose ""New Custom Executable..."" and name it something meaningful, like ""otest""</li>
<li>Make the executable path to be the <code>otest</code> binary, which should be located at <code>/Developer/Tools/otest</code></li>
<li>Set the following environment variables on the otest executable:
<ul>
<li><code>DYLD_FRAMEWORK_PATH</code> => <code>{UnitTest.bundle}/Contents/Frameworks</code></li>
<li><code>DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> => <code>{UnitTest.bundle}/Contents/Frameworks</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Set the following program arguments on the otest executable:
<ul>
<li><code>-SenTest All</code> (this will run all of the unit tests)</li>
<li><code>{UnitTest.bundle}</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>You can now select your unit test bundle as the active target, and the otest executable as the active executable, and then build and debug.  This will let  you set breakpoints, set other environment variables (like <code>NSZombieEnabled</code>), and so on.</p>

<p>If you only want to debug a certain suite or specific unit test, you can change the <code>-SenTest All</code> argument to <code>-SenTest MyUnitTestSuite</code> or <code>-SenTest MyUnitTestSuite/myUnitTestMethod</code>.</p>

","115730","","<p>I'd say the main reason you'd want to use the property setter instead of direct ivar access is simply consistency.  Yes, you can access the ivar directly, and you'll usually be just fine doing so.  However, I'd say it's stylistically better to use the same method for both setting and getting.  So if you're using property setters internally, you should also use property getters internally.  </p>

<p>Either <code>startNSNumber</code>, <code>endNSNumber</code> or <code>idString</code> is nil.  If you want to compare something against <code>nil</code> in an <code>NSPredicate</code>, you need to substitute in <code>[NSNull null]</code>, not <code>nil</code>.</p>

<p>I am trying to animate a series of images by setting a <code>UIButton</code>s image.</p>

<p>What is wrong with this code?</p>
","115730","","<p>Any variable used inside a block is <code>const</code> copied.  So really what you've got going on is this:</p>

<pre><code>-(void) animate:(UIButton*) b withState: (int) state andLastState:(int) last_state {
if (state &lt; last_state) {
 int stateTemp = state;
 float duration = 1.0 / 30.0;
 [b animateWithDuration: duration
     animations: ^{
      [UIImage imageNamed:[NSString stringWithFormat:@""m1.a000%d.png"", state]];
     }
     completion: ^{
      const int stateTempCopy = stateTemp;
      animate(b, stateTempCopy++, last_state); 
     }
 ];
 }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is trying to alter a <code>const</code> variable.  You can't do that.  Fortunately, there's a way around that, and that's with the <code>__block</code> specifier.</p>

<p>Simply change <code>int stateTemp = state;</code> to <code>__block int stateTemp = state;</code> and you'll be good to go.  (For the documentation on <code>__block</code>, check out <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/Blocks/Articles/bxVariables.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40007502-CH6-SW6"">the documentation</a>)</p>

"<p>I have been using the most excellent Accessorizer to auto-magically generate setters/getters for my Obj-C code in Xcode. Recently a change was made in Accessorizer:</p>

<p>old version of Accessorizer:<br>
@property (nonatomic, retain) NSMutableSet *setA;<br>
@property (nonatomic, retain) NSMutableSet *setB;  </p>

<p>new version of Accessorizer:<br>
@property (nonatomic, copy) NSMutableSet *setA;<br>
@property (nonatomic, copy) NSMutableSet *setB;  </p>

<p>Sadly, the new version crashes my code. In my code I do the following:</p>

<pre><code>self.setA = [[[NSMutableSet alloc] init] autorelease];
self.setB = [[[NSMutableSet alloc] init] autorelease];

<p>// ...</p>

<pre><code>[self.setA minusSet:self.setB];

<p>Thanks,<br>

","115730","","<p>Yes, this is a ""feature"" of properties.  When you set a property that's declared as <code>copy</code>, then the generated setter is going to invoke <code>-copy</code> on the object.  Unfortunately, in the case of mutable objects, this results in an <em>immutable</em> variant.</p>

<p>In other words, the object returned by <code>[myMutableSet copy]</code> is <strong>not</strong> mutable.</p>

<p>If you need the set to be mutable, then you <em>must</em> use <code>retain</code> (or override the setter to use <code>mutableCopy</code> instead of <code>copy</code>).</p>

<p>I filed a bug on this (rdar://8416047), but it was closed as ""works as designed"".  (Because there's really no way for the setter to know if an object is mutable or not)</p>

","115730","","<p>It's only convention.  Usually, we name our instance variables in a clear/logical fashion:</p>

<p>The problem here is that the parameter ""bar"" hides the instance variable named ""bar"", leading to a conflict and undesired behavior.  To rectify this, we tack on an article (when necessary) to the parameter to indicate that it can be <em>any</em> Bar, or <em>any</em> Baz:</p>

<pre><code>- (id) initWithBar:(Bar *)aBar baz:(Baz *)aBaz {
  if (self = [super init]) {

<p>A clue to this is that the function has the word ""Create"" in it, which (<a href=""http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/CoreFoundation/Conceptual/CFMemoryMgmt/Concepts/Ownership.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001148-103029"" rel=""nofollow"">according to the Create Rule</a>) means you are responsible for disposing of the memory created.</strike></p>

<p>(Guess I should read all the posted code before answering)</p>

<p>Since it appears you're properly disposing of stuff, I would run the Leaks instrument on your code and identify <em>what</em> is actually leaking.</p>

","115730","","<p>In Cocoa, it's a convention to indicate the something is private and shouldn't be used externally.

<p>However, that recommendation specifically applies to methods, not variables.  So if you'd like to prefix your variables with underscores, go right ahead.

<p>It doesn't work. How can it be changed to work?</p>
","115730","","<p>You're aware that <code>sortedArrayUsingDescriptors:</code> returns a new (sorted) array, correct?  If you want to sort the array in-place, then you need to make sure that <code>personArray</code> is an <code>NSMutableArray</code> and use its <code>sortUsingDescriptors:</code> method.</p>

<p><strong>edit</strong></p>

<p>Perhaps taking a look at the two methods will be more beneficial:</p>

<pre><code>-[NSArray sortedArrayUsingDescriptors:];
-[NSMutableArray sortUsingDescriptors:];
</code></pre>

<p>The first one starts with an adjective and a noun.  The adjective describes the noun.  The noun indicates that it is the return value.  Since the noun is ""array"", it would make sense that the return value of the method is an <code>NSArray</code>.  Since the adjective is ""sorted"", we can therefore assume that the returned array will be in some sort of order (the order being specified by the ""using"" the ""descriptors"").</p>

<p>The second one starts with a verb.  Since a verb is an action word, we can deduce that this is actually a behavioral method that will modify the receiver itself.  Since the verb is ""sort"", we can therefore assume that the receiver will be in some sort of order after the method has completed.</p>

<p>Other ""method pairs"" that follow this pattern:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>-[NSString stringByAppendingString:]</code> and <code>-[NSMutableString appendString:]</code></li>
<li><code>-[NSArray filteredArrayUsingPredicate:]</code> and <code>-[NSMutableArray filterUsingPredicate:]</code></li>
<li><code>-[NSCharacterSet invertedSet]</code> and <code>-[NSMutableCharacterSet invert]</code></li>
<li>...and many others</li>
</ul>

<p>Since you're using the first method (<code>sortedArrayUsingDescriptors:</code>), you <em>must</em> retrieve the return value of the method; otherwise you're doing all this work for nothing.  If you want to sort the array ""in place"" (ie, modify the receiver directly and <em>not</em> be given a new <code>NSArray</code>), then <code>personArray</code> <em>must</em> be an <code>NSMutableArray</code>, and you <em>must</em> use the <code>sortUsingDescriptors:</code> method.</p>

"<p>I have saved my images in database with type BLOB. Now I am extracting these images from database using sql stmt and saving it in a NSData object. see the following code snippet</p>

self.birdImage = [UIImage imageWithData:img];

<p>After getting image I tried setting it at image attribute of UIImageView to load it to image view. I used following techniques but nothing seems to work.</p>

<p>1.</p>

<pre><code>self.imgPikr = [[UIImageView alloc] initWithImage:brd.birdImage];  
[self.imgPikr setImage:brd.birdImage];

<p>3.</p>

<pre><code>   [self.imgPikr = [[UIImageView alloc] init];    
   [self.imgpikr setImage:brd.birdImage];

<p>Here <strong>imgPikr</strong> is a UIImageView object and birdImage is object of UIImage class.
every other data is displayed in view correctly except the image.

Any answer or experimentation is welcomed.</p>

<p>thanx in advance</p>
","115730","","<p>Option 1 is the best option, since <code>-[UIImageView initWithImage:]</code> will automatically resize the imageView to be the same size as the passed image (and it is also unnecessary to <code>setImage:</code> if you use this initializer).</p>

<p>However, as @Robot K points out in the comments, you still need to add <code>self.imgPikr</code> as a subview of a view that is visible on the screen.</p>

<p>Additionally, if your <code>imgPikr</code> property is declared as <code>(retain)</code>, then you have a memory leak.</p>

"<p>I'm refactoring a project that involves passing around a lot of arrays.  Currently, each method that returns an array sorts it right before returning it.  This isn't ideal for a couple reasons -- there's lots of duplicated code, it's inefficient to sort an array two or three times, and it's too easy to write a new function but to forget to sort the array before returning it.</p>

<p>I'm looking for a way to guarantee that the array always kept in alphabetical order.  My current thought is to subclass <code>NSMutableArray</code> and/or <code>NSArray</code> to create an alphabetized array class.  I would need to override all of the methods that create or modify the array to call <code>super</code> and then sort itself.</p>

<p>Does this sound reasonable, or is there a better approach?</p>

<p>EDIT:
Since performance issues have been mentioned, I'll include the relevant information from my project.  Speed is not an important concern.  The whole process only takes a few seconds, and the tool is only used every so often.  So simplicity and obvious correctness is more important.</p>

<p>Also, the use case for arrays is specific.  When an array is returned, the caller always accesses every element in the array at least once.</p>

<li>Text replaced for the app name in IB</li>
<li>Colour schemes for all images such as backgrounds, icons etc</li>

<p>Looking around a bit I could have an 'images' folder for each brand and drag it in to build that brand's app, however the text is still an issue.</p>

<p>The first category is super easy.  If you have your colo(u)r schemes stored in some easily-readable format like a plist or whatever, you can just load up that file during app startup, and build <code>UIColor</code> objects from them and use those where appropriate.  The same goes for images used within the app itself.  This is not a hard problem.</p>

<p>The second category is trickier.  This is stuff that has to be baked into the application because of code signing.  This means that the things like the App Name, the icon, Default.png, etc, all have to be changed before the app is signed in the compilation process.  So what I'd do is bake up a bunch of scripts to take your branding information (name, image files, icons, etc) and load it up, then <em>generate</em> your Info.plist file and whatnot.  This should be done as one of the first phases of your compilation.</p>

<p>For what it's worth, I work on an application where we do <em>exactly</em> this process, and it works pretty well.  It's a bit tedious to update when we change what resources get branded, but I'm not sure there's any decent way around that.</p>

<p>I want the slot name (slotName in the struct) to be retained each time I assign it in my methods, but this is not a property since not visible from outside.</p>

<p>For example, each time I initialize it with another NSString, I do this:</p>

<pre><code>//_tmpName is a NSString
// Warning: slotName must be released later since we retain it.
m_cardDevice[i].slotName = [[NSString stringWithString: _tmpName] retain];
</code></pre>

<p>I really feel this is not a ""good"" (not elegant) way of doing.</p>

<p>I think I should remove the _device_descriptor struct and have something like this:</p>

<pre><code>NSInteger accessoryNumber[NUMBER_MAX_CARD_READERS];                   // Accessory the device belongs to
    NSInteger slotNumber[NUMBER_MAX_CARD_READERS];                    // Slot number used for the device
    NSString* slotName[NUMBER_MAX_CARD_READERS];

","115730","","<p>You're right; you can't do this via property syntax.  I'd probably write C functions for getting and setting the struct fields, and then just make an arbitrary rule that accessing data from the structs in any way other than the functions is improper.</p>

<p>For example, I'd have:</p>

<pre><code>device_descriptor_t* DeviceDescriptorCreate(NSInteger accessoryNumber,
                                            NSInteger slotNumber,
                                            NSString* slotName); //malloc()

void DeviceDescriptorDestroy(device_descriptor_t* device); //free()
void DeviceDescriptorSetSlotName(device_descriptor_t* device, NSString* slotName); //release old value, set new one
NSString* DeviceDescriptorGetSlotName(device_descriptor_t* device);

"<p>So, let's say you have a local variable NSArray *myArray declared in your class header file.</p>

<p>You then write <code>@property (nonatomic, retain) NSArray *myArray</code> also in your header file.</p>

<p>All very standard so far. You now have a variable myArray, which can be accessed through setters and getters synthesized by Apple.</p>

<p>A little bit later, you initialise your variable.</p>

<pre><code>NSArray *anArray = [[NSArray alloc] initWithObjects etc etc...];
self.myArray = anArray;
[anArray release];
</code></pre>

<p>So now myArray is pointing to an array in memory, which has a release count of one (if I'm not mistaken).</p>

<p>My question is, why can't we write</p>

<p>However, something is raising a warning bell in my head with this approach. Better ways to do it?</p>
","115730","","<p>It's not unheard-of, but it is somewhat uncommon.  The main way I've seen it used (and used it myself) is when you're dealing with some sort of semi-synchronous object (by semi-synchronous I mean that it does not block the main thread, but it also does not execute on a background thread; an <code>NSURLConnection</code> would fit this bill).  For example, I wrote a subclass of <code>NSWindowController</code> that was specifically for displaying a window as a sheet and for invoking some certain delegate callbacks.  Basically, you'd <code>alloc</code>/<code>init</code> a new sheet controller and invoke <code>beginSheetForWindow:</code>.  This would run the sheet semi-synchronously, and then invoke an appropriate callback when the sheet was dismissed.</p>

<p>Since the invoking object doesn't necessarily ""own"" the sheet (think of it as a Mac version of a modal view controller on iOS), the sheet controller does <code>[self retain]</code> immediately before showing the sheet, and <code>[self release]</code> immediately after cleaning up and invoking callbacks.  The purpose behind this was to ensure that the <em>controller</em> object would stick around until the sheet was done.  (The sheet, IIRC, was retained by the runloop, but I also needed the controller to stick around)</p>

<p>Like I said, it's very rare to come across a situation where you would want to <code>[self retain]</code>, but it's not impossible.  However, as a general rule of thumb, if you think that you need to <code>[self retain]</code>, you may want to think again.</p>

"<p>Is it possible to define your own key path operators, such as @avg, @sum, etc…</p>
","115730","","<p>Short answer: Kinda. You can override <code>valueForKeyPath:</code> to intercept your custom operator or forward on to <code>super</code>, but that can be problematic (I'll leave the explanation to that as an exercise to the reader).</p>

<p>Long answer: Yes you can, but it relies on using private behavior (not private api).</p>

<p>After some neat introspection of <code>NSArray</code>, I found some private methods:</p>

<pre><code>_distinctUnionOfSetsForKeyPath:
_distinctUnionOfObjectsForKeyPath:
_distinctUnionOfArraysForKeyPath:
_unionOfSetsForKeyPath:
_unionOfArraysForKeyPath:
_unionOfObjectsForKeyPath:
_minForKeyPath:
_maxForKeyPath:
_countForKeyPath:
_avgForKeyPath:
_sumForKeyPath:
</code></pre>

<p>Well, neat!  Those methods seem to match the operators you can use with collections: <code>@sum</code>, <code>@min</code>, <code>@max</code>, <code>@distinctUnionOfObjects</code>, etc.  The <code>@</code> has been replaced with an underscore and we've got <code>ForKeyPath:</code> appended.</p>

<p>So it would seem that we can create a new method to match the appropriate signature and we're good to go.</p>

<p>So:</p>

<pre><code>@interface NSArray (CustomOperator)

- (id) _fooForKeyPath:(NSString *)keyPath;

@end

@implementation NSArray (CustomOperator)

- (id) _fooForKeyPath:(NSString *)keyPath {
  //keyPath will be what comes after the keyPath.  In this example, it will be ""self""
  return @""Hello world!"";
}

@end

NSArray * array = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:@""1"", @""2"", @""3"", nil];
NSLog(@""%@"", [array valueForKeyPath:@""@foo.SELF""]); //logs ""Hello world!""
</code></pre>

<p>It works, but I'm not sure I would rely on this, since it relies on an implementation detail that could change in the future.</p>

"<p>I have a bunch of Boy objects and a bunch of Girl objects.  I want to keep a list of the girl that each boy likes the most.  It is OK if multiple boys like the same girl.</p>

<p>I was going to use an NSMutableDictionary, but the setObject: forKey: method of that class copies the key before adding the pair to the dictionary.  So rather than the boy liking the girl, we would have a clone of the boy liking the girl.</p>

<p>Normally I would do this by adding a favoriteGirl property to the Boy class.  But the problem is that the boys are really UIView objects, so I would have to subclass a bunch of different UIView subclasses.</p>

<p>Obviously I could write my own custom class to do this . . . but it feels like Apple must have a simple way to do what I want . . . what am I missing?</p>

"<p>Is there a way to inspect a NSPredicate object for the purposes of serializing it into a URL? I am trying to retrieve the data remotely and need to translate the predicate object into a URL with querystring parameters that the server understands.</p>

<p>This was inspired by a talk given in WWDC 2010 called ""Building a Server Driven User EXperience"" where the speakers talk about using Core-Data and with a server backend. I have followed the session video and slides, but am stuck on the serializing point. For example, there is a <code>Person</code> object, and I'm trying to fetch all people whose first name is ""John"". I am using a subclass of <code>NSManagedObjectContext</code> called <code>RemoteManagedObjectContext</code>, which overrides the <code>executeFetchRequest</code> method, and is supposed to send the call to the server instead. The fetch request is being created as (ellipsed non-essential parts):</p>

<pre><code>@implementation PeopleViewController

- (NSArray *)getPeople {
    RemoteFetchRequest *fetchRequest = [[RemoteFetchRequest alloc] init];
    NSEntityDescription *entity = ...
    NSPredicate *template = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:
                                @""name == $NAME AND endpoint = $ENDPOINT""];
    NSPredicate *predicate = [template predicateWithSubstitutionVariables:...];

    [fetchRequest setEntity:entity];
    [fetchRequest setPredicate:predicate];

    NSError *error = nil;
    // the custom subclass of NSManagedObjectContext executes this
    return [remoteMOC executeFetchRequest:fetchRequest error:&amp;error];
}

@end
</code></pre>

<p>Now inside the custom subclass of <code>NSManagedObjectContext</code>, how can I serialize the fetch request into querystring parameters suitable for the server. So given the above fetch request, the corresponding URL would be:</p>

<pre><code>http://example.com/people?name=John
</code></pre>

<p>It is possible to get a string representation of the predicate which returns,</p>

<pre><code>name == ""John"" AND endpoint == ""people""
</code></pre>

<p>that I can parse to get the parameters <code>name</code>, and <code>endpoint</code>. However, is it possible to do it without parsing the string? Here's a partial implementation of the <code>RemoteManagedObjectContext</code> class.</p>

<pre><code>@implementation RemoteManagedObjectContext

- (NSArray *)executeFetchRequest:(NSFetchRequest *)request error:(NSError **)error {
    // this gives name == ""John"" AND endpoint == ""people""
    // don't know how else to retrieve the predicate data
    NSLog(@""%@"", [[request predicate] predicateFormat]);

    ...
}

@end
</code></pre>
","115730","","<p>Even better than a string representation is an object-oriented representation!  And it's done automatically!</p>

<p>First, check the class of the <code>NSPredicate</code>.  It will be an <code>NSCompoundPredicate</code>.  Cast it to an appropriate variable.</p>

<p>You'll then see that it's <code>compoundPredicateType</code> is <code>NSAndPredicateType</code>, just like you'd expect.</p>

<p>You can also see that the array returned by <code>-subpredicates</code> reveals 2 <code>NSComparisonPredicates</code>.</p>

<p>The first subpredicate has a left expression of type <code>NSKeyPathExpressionType</code> and a <code>-keyPath</code> of <code>@""name""</code>, the operator is <code>NSEqualToPredicateOperatorType</code>.  The right expression will be an <code>NSExpression</code> of type <code>NSConstantValueExpressionType</code>, and the <code>-constantValue</code> will be <code>@""John""</code>.</p>

<p>The second subpredicate will be similar, except that the left expression's <code>keyPath</code> will be <code>@""endpoint""</code>, and the right expression's <code>constantValue</code> will be <code>@""people""</code>.</p>

<p>If you want more in-depth information on turning <code>NSPredicates</code> into an HTTP Get request, check out my <a href=""https://github.com/davedelong/StackKit"" rel=""nofollow"">StackOverflow framework, ""StackKit""</a>, which does just that.  It's basically a framework that behaves similarly to CoreData, but uses StackOverflow.com (or any other stack exchange site) to retrieve information.

"<p>I have a situation where it seems like I need to add instance variables to a category, but I know from Apple's docs that I can't do that. So I'm wondering what the best alternative or workaround is.</p>

<p>What I want to do is add a category that adds functionality to UIViewControllers. I would find it useful in all my different UIViewControllers, no matter what specific UIViewController subclass they extend, so I think a category is the best solution. To implement this functionality, I need several different methods, and I need to track data in between them, so that's what led me to wanting to create instance methods.</p>

<p>In case it's helpful, here's what I specifically want to do. I want to make it easier to track when the software keyboard hides and shows, so that I can resize content in my view. I've found that the only way to do it reliably is to put code in four different UIViewController methods, and track extra data in instance variables. So those methods and instance variables are what I'd like to put into a category, so I don't have to copy-paste them each time I need to handle the software keyboard. (If there's a simpler solution for this exact problem, that's fine too--but I would still like to know the answer to category instance variables for future reference!)</p>
","115730","","<p>Yes you can do this, but since you're asking, I have to ask:  Are you absolutely sure that you need to?  (If you say ""yes"", then go back, figure out what you want to do, and see if there's a different way to do it)</p>

"<p>is there a way to do a DateAdd or a DateDiff function on an NSPredicate?
Thank you,
Jose.</p>
","115730","","<p>Actually, there is!  It's a roundabout way of doing it, because <code>NSPredicate</code> doesn't support it directly (ie, you can't just <code>+ anInterval</code> to an <code>NSDate</code>).  Fortunately, you can do it, and luckily for you, I just figured it out about 2 days ago.</p>

<p>To clarify: I'm assuming you're asking for something like: ""an object has a <code>date</code> property.  I want to see if this <code>date</code> property is some arbitrary interval before/after another date"".  If that's what you mean, then yes you can do it.  If that's not what you mean, then please clarify your question.</p>

<p>Here we go.  In this example, we're going to assume the object against which we'll be evaluating this predicate has a property called <code>date</code> that returns an <code>NSDate</code>.  We are going to see if this date is at least 1 day before another date.  There are a couple different ways we could do this comparison:</p>

<pre><code>date + 1 day is before comparisonDate
date is before comparisonDate - 1 day
</code></pre>

<p>I'm going to go with the first approach:</p>

<pre><code>NSDate * comparisonDate = ...; //an arbitrary NSDate object, against which we're going to be doing our comparison
NSTimeInterval interval = 86400; //the number of seconds you want add or subtract.

NSPredicate * p = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@""CAST(CAST(date, 'NSNumber') + %f, 'NSDate') &lt; %@"", interval, comparisonDate];
</code></pre>

<p>What's going on:</p>

<p>To get this to work, we can <code>CAST()</code> a date object to an <code>NSNumber</code>.  This is going to convert the <code>NSDate</code> into an <code>NSNumber</code> which is some number of seconds from a reference point in time (such as 1 Jan 1970 or whatever).  To that number we add or subtract our interval, and then cast the new number back to an <code>NSDate</code>.  Then we can use a regular comparison operator to compare our new date against our comparison date.</p>

<p>There are a couple different variations on this idea, but they all require casting an <code>NSDate</code> to a number (or casting a number to an <code>NSDate</code>) to get its time interval.</p>

<p>Devious, eh?</p>

<p><strong>edit</strong></p>

<p>If Core Data is complaining about the construct of the predicate, try reversing things:</p>

<pre><code>NSDate * comparisonDate = ...;
NSTimeInterval interval = 86400;

NSPredicate * p = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@""date &lt; CAST(CAST(%@, 'NSNumber') - %f, 'NSDate')"", comparisonDate, interval];

","115730","","<p>While the standard way to do this would be with an <code>NSArray</code>, you can do this with a C-style array as well:</p>

<pre><code>int numObjects = 42;
Params ** params = malloc(sizeof(Param*) * numObjects);
for (int i = 0; i &lt; numObjects; ++i) {

free(params);

"<p>Ours is an open-source Mac application localized by volunteers. These volunteers will do their work on special localization builds of the software (with unstripped nibs), then send us the changes to integrate into the original xib and strings files.</p>

<p>The only way to do both that I can see is for localizers to work directly with the original xibs and send us diffs. That means they have to download the entire source code, not just a localizable version of the release, work in Xcode as well as IB, and either run the diff command themselves (per xib) or install and use Mercurial.</p>

<p>Is there any better way for a xib-based application?</p>
","115730","","<p>Where I used to work, we had this issue as well.  Our app was getting translated into 10 different languages.</p>

<p>At first, we tried doing what Wil suggested, which is to make everything super wide and fit in every language.  Unfortunately, ""online backup"" might be pretty short in English, but in other languages (especially Spanish), it's really long (""copia de seguridad"" just means ""backup"").  Widening our UI made everything look pretty terrible.</p>

<p>One day, I was playing around with some Core Animation stuff and discovered the <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/graphicsimaging/Reference/CAConstraint_class/Introduction/Introduction.html"" rel=""nofollow""><code>CAConstraint</code></a> class.  <code>CAConstraint</code> is basically a way to define a layout relationship between two <code>CALayers</code>.  You give one layer a name (like ""layerA"") and then say ""layerB is constrained [in such-and-such a way] to a sibling layer called layerA"".  Then, whenever the layer named <code>layerA</code> is repositioned or resized, <code>layerB</code> automatically moves as well.  It's really neat, and it's just what we were looking for.</p>

<p>After a couple of days of work, I came up with what is now <a href=""https://github.com/davedelong/CHLayoutManager"" rel=""nofollow""><code>CHLayoutManager</code></a>.  It's basically a re-make of <code>CAConstraint</code> and friends, but for <code>NSViews</code>.  Here's a simple example of how it works:</p>

<pre><code>CHLayoutConstraint * centerHorizontal = [CHLayoutConstraint constraintWithAttribute:CHLayoutConstraintAttributeMidX relativeTo:@""superview"" attribute:CHLayoutConstraintAttributeMidX];
CHLayoutConstraint * centerVertical = [CHLayoutConstraint constraintWithAttribute:CHLayoutConstraintAttributeMidY relativeTo:@""superview"" attribute:CHLayoutConstraintAttributeMidY];
[aView addConstraint:centerHorizontal];
[aView addConstraint:centerVertical];
</code></pre>

<p>This will keep <code>aView</code> centered in its superview, regardless of how the superview is resized.  Here's another:</p>

<pre><code>[button1 setLayoutName:@""button1""];
[button2 addConstraint:[CHLayoutConstraint constraintWithAttribute:CHLayoutConstraintAttributeMinX relativeTo:@""button1"" attribute:CHLayoutConstraintAttributeMaxX]];
[button2 addConstraint:[CHLayoutConstraint constraintWithAttribute:CHLayoutConstraintAttributeMaxY relativeTo:@""button1"" attribute:CHLayoutConstraintAttributeMaxY]];
[button2 addConstraint:[CHLayoutConstraint constraintWithAttribute:CHLayoutConstraintAttributeWidth relativeTo:@""button1"" attribute:CHLayoutConstraintAttributeWidth]];
</code></pre>

<p>This will keep <code>button2</code> anchored to the right edge of <code>button1</code>, as well as keeping <code>button2</code>'s Y position and width the same as <code>button1</code>'s.</p>

<p>Internally, <code>CHLayoutManager</code> uses an <code>NSValueTransformer</code> to calculate the new positioning information.  Some of the <code>CHLayoutConstraint</code> initializers accept an <code>NSValueTransformer</code>, so you can create arbitrarily complex layout manipulations.</p>

<p>We used this for constraining and laying out the entire UI, and then doing all of the localization in code (and subsequently calling <code>-sizeToFit</code>, with some modifications).  Our UI would just flow into its final layout.  It turned out to be <em>extremely</em> convenient.  We'd just package up our <code>.strings</code> files, send them off to the translators, and then drop them in to place when we got them back, and our app would instantly be localized for that language.</p>

<p><code>CHLayoutManager</code> isn't perfect.  It doesn't resolve conflicts, but simply applies constraints in the order they're added.  So you can constrain (for example) the <code>MinX</code> of a view 42 different ways, but only the last one will be used.  Also, if you constrain the MinX and the MaxX, they'll also be applied in the order they're added and will not end up stretching or shrinking the width.  In other words, constraining one attribute of a view will not affect the other attributes.  It's compatible with 10.5+ (GC and non).  However, due to some changes in Lion, it's unlikely that I'll address the shortcomings.</p>

<p>Despite these shortcomings, it's an extremely flexible framework, and (IMO) some pretty nifty code. (Plus, I swizzle <code>-[NSView dealloc]</code>! Yay!)</p>

<p>Now that AppKit has this same functionality (via <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/AppKit/Reference/NSLayoutConstraint_Class/NSLayoutConstraint/NSLayoutConstraint.html#//apple_ref/occ/clm/NSLayoutConstraint/constraintWithItem%3aattribute%3arelatedBy%3atoItem%3aattribute%3amultiplier%3aconstant%3a"" rel=""nofollow""><code>NSLayoutConstraint</code></a>), I recommend using that system instead of <code>CHLayoutManager</code>.

"<p>What is the best way in Cocoa (and Mac OS X) to schedule a program to be run:</p>

<ul>
<li>when the user logs in.</li>
<li>at certain times of the day (for example: 12:00 noon).</li>
<li>at certain time intervals (for example: every two hours).</li>
</ul>

<p>Besides scheduling, it should also be easy to un-schedule the program and not cause errors should the user delete the application.</p>

<p>Essentially the program is a satellite command-line executable placed next to the main application's file within the same <code>.app</code> bundle. The program's purpose is to do some background data updates in the user's home directory (within <code>~/Library/Application Support/MyApp</code>.)</p>

<p>Is <code>crontab</code> a good candidate for this? The <code>man</code> page for <code>crontab</code> said that the functionality has been absorbed to <code>launchctl</code>, but I can't seem to find how to schedule specific times to run the utility.</p>

","115730","","<p><code>launchd</code> is the proper way to do this (<code>crontab</code> is deprecated on the Mac in favor of <code>launchd</code>).

<ul>
<li>The <code>StartCalendarInterval</code> should run your program at the top of the 12th hour (so noon).</li>
<li>The <code>StartInterval</code> should run your program every 2 hours (= 7200 seconds)</li>
<li>The <code>LimitLoadToSessionType</code> only loads your program when an Aqua session begins (the user actually logs in to the window server (so this would prevent loading if the user <code>ssh</code>'s in)</li>
<li>The <code>RunAtLoad</code> tells the executable to run when the plist is loaded.  This, combined with the <code>LimitLoadToSessionType</code>, should start the executable when the user logs in.</li>
</ul>

<p>It's possible that <code>StartInterval</code> and <code>StartCalendarInterval</code> are mutually exclusive.  If that's the case, you can take out the <code>StartInterval</code> key and change the <code>StartCalendarInterval</code> stuff to:</p>

"<p>I try to figure out how things really work. So I thought when I would overwrite certain methods using categories, I would get interesting NSLogs.</p>

<p>It's just for personal learning purposes. I want to see the event delivery in action.</p>
","115730","","<p>You can do it, but not using a category.  A category replaces a method.  (Warning, car analogy) If you have a car, and you destroy that car and replace it with a new car, can you still use the old car? No, because it is gone and does not exist anymore.  The same with categories.</p>

<p>What you could do is use the Objective-C runtime to add the method under a different name at runtime (say, ""<code>bogusHitTest:withEvent:</code>""), then swap the implementations of <code>hitTest:withEvent:</code> and <code>bogusHitTest:withEvent:</code>.  That way when the code calls <code>hitTest:withEvent:</code>, it's going to execute the code that was originally written for <code>bogusHitTest:withEvent:</code>.  You can then have that code invoke <code>bogusHitTest:withEvent:</code>, which will execute the original implementation.</p>

","115730","","<p>OK, so I checked things out and you're right, there is pretty blatant memory buildup.</p>

There's an <code>unsigned short</code> counter that gets incremented in the loop, and within the loop, I <code>-drain</code> and re-alloc the pool if the counter ever hits 0.</p>

<p>Essentially:</p>

<pre><code>NSAutoreleasePool * pool = [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init];
unsigned short counter = 0;
while (error == nil &amp;&amp; 
       (currentCharacter = [self nextCharacter]) &amp;&amp; 
       currentCharacter != nil) {
    //process the current character
    counter++;
    if (counter == 0) { //this happens every 65,536 (2**16) iterations when the unsigned short overflows
        //retain the characters that need to out-live this pool

"<p>I'm trying to create a semi-complex set of view animations (think an animated version of an <code>NSMatrix</code> form, where rows slide around as other rows are added or removed), and to build the animation I'm making a little helper class.</p>

<p>There I have to keep track of the different views, their ordered indices, and few some other values associated with their animations.</p>

<p>To that end, I'm using an <code>NSArray</code> instance to keep track of the ordering (indices) of the views, and I'd like to use an <code>NSDictionary</code> with the views as keys to keep track of the values (the values themselves are in nested dictionaries). I.e. I'd like to be able to do something this, for instance (pseudo code):</p>

// Loop thru an ordered NSArray
for( (NSView*) view in viewsArray ) {

    // doesn't support copyWithZone.... darn

I could conceivably use <code>[obj description]</code> since the memory address you get back is a perfect UID, but of course the system has to work with any kind of <code>NSView</code> subclass that might return something else entirely, so that's no good.</p>

<p>Or should I maybe try something else entirely? Is there maybe some alternative to <code>NSDictionary</code>, where keys just aren't copied? Because in this case I really have no need for the keys to ever be copied.</p>
","115730","","<p>Sometimes there are occasions where you want to use a view (whether <code>NS</code> or <code>UI</code>) as the key in a dictionary.  I've come across one such situation.

In your case, you'll probably want a map table with ""weak"" keys and ""strong"" values, but read the documentation for all the fun details.</p>

<p><a href=""http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/CoreFoundation/Reference/CFMutableDictionaryRef/Reference/reference.html""><code>CFMutableDictionaryRef</code></a> is the Core Foundation equivalent of an <code>NSDictionary</code> (they are toll-free bridged), but it has some extra creation options.

One is a structure that defines the memory management (and other) behavior of how to deal with the keys of the dictionary, and the other is a <code>struct</code> for defining the behavior of the values.  You can create a <code>CFMutableDictionaryRef</code> with the options of retaining the keys (instead of copying them) and then retaining the values.  Once you've done this, you can cast the <code>CFMutableDictionaryRef</code> to an <code>NSMutableDictionary</code> and use it as you'd expect, just that the keys will be retained instead of copied.</p>

"<p>In the Apple Documentation, it is stated that NSDate objects are immutable which I presume means that once they are initialised with a value, they cannot/shouldn't be changed. </p>

<p>Your question also reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of how pointers work.  Yes, the documentation says that <code>NSDate</code> objects are immutable.  But <code>fromDate</code> is not an <code>NSDate</code>.  It is an <code>NSDate*</code>.  In other words, it is simply a forwarding address that points to where the actual <code>NSDate</code> object lives.  The pointer itself is mutable (unless it's declared as <code>const</code>), and you can feel free to change the <em>pointer</em>'s value as much as you like.  However, the thing that the pointer points to (the actual <code>NSDate</code>) is correctly immutable.</p>

<p>Essentially, I'd like to generalize my API to take objects that that conform to <code>&lt;NSReallyReallyLongName&gt;</code>, but I'd like both me and consumers of my API to not have to type so much. One possible solution is a <code>typedef</code>:</p>

<pre><code>typedef id &lt;NSReallyReallyLongName&gt; ShortName;
</code></pre>

<p>But this makes it less clear for API consumers that I'm establishing a protocol-based constraint. Any ideas?</p>

<p>Why is this better?  There are several reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>The keys in a query string should be URL encoded.  Granted that right now they're just one letter that's in the ASCII set, but can you guarantee that they'll always be?</li>
<li>The values in a query string should be URL encoded.  Right now you're only trying to plus-encode the spaces.  What if your address contains an <code>&amp;</code> or <code>=</code>?  It would be unusual for an address, but not impossible (especially the <code>&amp;</code> in a street name).</li>
<li>This is highly extensible.  If you decide to add support for foreign address and need more than a simple ASCII address, it's rather trivial to add the <code>@""UTF-8""</code> and <code>@""oe""</code> object and key to the dictionary for inclusion in the query string.</li>
<li>The percent encoding (if you use the category method linked to above) is more accurate than <code>stringByAddingPercentEscapesUsingEncoding:</code></li>

<p>Thanks</p>
","115730","","<p>You don't really update or delete something form the plist file.  It's a bit more involved than that:</p>

<ol>
<li>Read the plist file into memory</li>
<li>Alter the in-memory version</li>
<li>Write the new version back out to disk</li>
</ol>

<p>Reading in a plist is pretty trivial.  In your case, since the root element is an array, you'd do:</p>

<pre><code>NSMutableArray * plistContents = [NSMutableArray arrayWithContentsOfFile:plistFilePath];
</code></pre>

<p>Here we create a mutable array, since we know we're going to be changing stuff in it.  If we just wanted to read the information, we should use <code>NSArray</code> instead of <code>NSMutableArray</code>.</p>

<p>Altering the in-memory version is as simple as manipulating standard containers:</p>

<pre><code>//delete the first dictionary:
[plistContents removeObjectAtIndex:0];

//Change a dictionary's full name:
NSMutableDictionary * firstDictionary = [[plistContents objectsAtIndex:0] mutableCopy];
[firstDictionary setObject:@""Mike"" forKey:@""fullName""];
[plistContents replaceObjectAtIndex:0 withObject:firstDictionary];
[firstDictionary release];
</code></pre>

<p>Here we have to make a mutable (changeable) copy of the dictionary, since reading in a plist only creates the immutable <code>NSDictionary</code>.  So we copy the dictionary, change the value we want to change, and then replace the original dictionary with our new modified dictionary.</p>

<p>Writing the plist out to disk is also simple:</p>

<pre><code>//be sure you have write-permissions first!
[plistContents writeToFile:plistFilePath atomically:YES];

","115730","","<p>It's possible that you're linking against an older version of the frameworks on the iPhone and a newer version on the iPad.  If the older version was inadvertently leaking a string, it's likely that the leak was fixed in a newer version of the framework.</p>

<p>At any case, it ultimately means that you're not managing your memory correctly.  Any time you see ""message sent to deallocated instance"", it means you've under-retained or over-released an object.  Search this site for how to use <code>NSZombieEnabled</code> (or the Zombies tool in Instruments).  Those answers will give you the best information on how to track down the source of the bug. :)</p>

","115730","","<p>Core Data is meant to be used programmatically.  Once you run the app once, it should create a file somewhere on disk (exactly where is probably specified in the AppDelegate class).

"<p>I've been working a product display app but it has a memory leak that causes it to crash after too many categories have been loaded up.

<p>I would really appreciate any specific help regarding my code or general tips on what could be wrong.</p>
","115730","","<p>I see a few things wrong:</p>

<ol>
<li>As was mentioned in the comments, you're abusing <code>-autorelease</code> in ways which make grown men cry and that which will crash your app.</li>
<li><code>-processXML</code> is returning an owned object.  You're allocating <code>products</code> and returning it.  This breaks convention, because the method name does not begin with <code>new</code> or <code>alloc</code>, and does not contain <code>copy</code>.  You should <code>return [products autorelease];</code> instead.  However, even that is shady, because since <code>products</code> isn't declared locally, it's probably an instance variable.  In that case, what happens if <code>processXML</code> gets invoked multiple times?  You have an owned object referenced by the instance variable, and suddenly you overwrite that reference with a new one... = memory leak.</li>
<li>Every time someone does <code>MyClass * object = [[MyClass alloc] init]; object = [something thatReturnsAMyClass];</code>, a kitten dies.  If you then do <code>[object release];</code>, a second dies for good measure.  This is a terrible, terrible memory leak (and a likely crash).  You're allocating a new object and then immediately throwing it away but never releasing it.  That you do this suggests you don't really get what a pointer is.  I suggest reading ""<a href=""http://boredzo.org/pointers/"" rel=""nofollow"">Everything you need to know about pointers in C</a>""</li>
<li>On a lighter note, you should check out <code>-[NSString stringByAppendingPathComponent:]</code>.  <code>NSString</code> has a bunch of really nice methods for dealing with paths.</li>

"<p>I am a fairly new to objective-c and to object oriented programming in general and have a theoretical, stylistic type question.

"<p>I am curious of the memory allocation for the following code.</p>

<p>What happens when I then call</p>

<pre><code>myString = @""Hello world"";

<p>Is my reference the same as the autoreleased object <code>NSString</code> provided or did I just allocate a new object that I am responsible for releasing?</p>
","115730","","<p>When wondering whether you own an object, ask yourself:</p>

<p>Does the method I used to create this object...</p>

<ul>
<li>begin with <code>new</code>?</li>
<li>begin with <code>alloc</code>?</li>
<li>contain <code>copy</code>?</li>
<li>equal <code>retain</code>?</li>
</ul>

<p>If you can answer ""Yes"" to any of those, then you are responsible for invoking <code>release</code> or <code>autorelease</code> on the returned object.  (Note that the rules for Core Foundation objects are <em>slightly</em> different.  Also note that anything that the documentation explicitly says that contradicts this wins.  The documentation always supersedes the guidelines)</p>

<p>In the case of your string, the answers to all your questions are ""no"", so you are not responsible for the object.  Constant strings (of the style <code>@""foo""</code>) are hard-coded into the application binary and <em>cannot</em> be deallocated.  That, however, is an implementation detail.  As long as you follow the memory management rules, you'll be good!</p>

<p><strong>edit</strong> retrieving primitives:</p>

<p>While it's possible to retrieve the values of primitive ivars using stuff like <code>valueForKey:</code> or <code>object_getInstanceVariable()</code>, the fact that you're requesting this is (in my book) a sign of poorly designed code.  Even without looking at your code, I guarantee you that there's a better way to be doing this.</p>

<p>That being said, here's a loaded gun on how to get primitive values out of instance variables by name:</p>

<pre><code>#import &lt;objc/runtime.h&gt;

//self has an ivar named ""i""
int *iPtr = 0;
object_getInstanceVariable(self, ""i"", (void**)&amp;iPtr);
NSLog(@""%d"", (int)iPtr);

<p>However, if you ever use this code in a production environment for anything beyond explicitly debugging something, then I'd say you deserve any crashes you get.  (Not that this code is crash-prone, but rather that it'd be probably be representative of the rest of the code)</p>

"<p>i am working on a sort of simulator for a game i am designing and am in need of a bit of help. the basic simulator will run from within GNUstep's compiler via dos i suppose is the best way to describe it. The basic idea is this: when the program loads it will ask to select the ID of a unit from a populated list upon selection it references a class and creates a new class and its methods then it asks for a defending unit ID, and follows the similar path of creating that new class and methods. i apologize if my terminology is wrong on methods and such.</p>

<p>in any case so far all that i want to have happen happens. i can call the new units via entry by using cases.</p>

<p>on to the hard part:</p>

<pre><code>@interface Unit1: NSObject {         @interface Unit2: NSObject {

    int unitType;                        int unitType;
    int attackInfantry;                  int attackInfantry;
    int attackArmored;                   int attackArmored;
    int attackAerial;                    int attackAerial;
    int attackAquatic;                   int attackAquatic;
    int attackHeroic;                    int attackHeroic;

    int attackHP;                        int attackHP;
    int attackBAV;                       int attackBAV;
    int attackBDV;                       int attackBDV;

</code></pre>

<p>so heres an example of my interface we have two units here: Next up is the implementation:</p>

<pre><code>@implementation Marine                    @implementation Speeder

-(void) Stats                             -(void) Stats
{                                         {

  attackHP = 10;                            attackHP = 10;
  attackBAV = 20;                           attackBAV = 23;
  attackBDV = 10;                           attackBDV = 10;

  unitType = 1;                             unitType = 2;
  attackInfantry = 15;                      attackInfantry = 23;
  attackArmored = 10;                       attackArmored = 18;
  attackAerial = 0;                         attackAerial = 9;
  attackAquatic = 7;                        attackAquatic = 15;
  attackHeroic = 0;                         attackHeroic = 0;
}                                         }
</code></pre>

<p>so heres the plan, what i would like to do is have some way of recognizing the unitType and then selecting the proper attack value. so in this case 1 equals infantry and 2 equals armored. for this example the first unit would be using attackArmored = 10; because the program recognizes that the second unit has unitType = 2; and the second unit would use attackInfantry = 23; for the same reason, it knows that it is attacking an infantry type unit.</p>

<p>im not sure if i have the units set up as properly as they should be, but im building this simulator with the intent on learning as i am new to objective-C and the world of code.</p>

<p>i hope this all made sense and i was able to get my question across...</p>
","115730","","<p>Seems like both <code>Unit1</code> (should probably be <code>InfantryUnit</code>) and <code>Unit2</code> (should probably be <code>SpeederUnit</code>) should have an abstract parent called <code>Unit</code>.  All the properties (<code>attackHP</code>, etc) would be defined in <code>Unit</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>-init</code> method of each subclass of <code>Unit</code> would set up the hit points, attack values, etc of that particular unit.</p>

<p>I would also have a method on <code>Unit</code> that goes something like this:</p>

<pre><code>typedef enum {
  UnitTypeInfantry = 1,
  UnitTypeSpeeder = 2
} UnitType;

+ (Unit *) unitWithType:(UnitType)type {
  if (type == UnitTypeInfantry) {
    return [[[InfantryUnit alloc] init] autorelease];
  } else if (type == UnitTypeSpeeder) {
    return [[[SpeederUnit alloc] init] autorelease];

"<p>I wanted a variation of NSRegularExpression's <code>– stringByReplacingMatchesInString:options:range:withTemplate:</code> method that takes a block instead of a template.

<li>Is there some way to implement its internals using <code>-enumerateMatchesInString:options:range:usingBlock:

"<p>I'm a bit new to Objective-C, and I've been trying to do something that apparently isn't allowed, even though it's common practice in other languages (I think).</p>

<p>As a specific example, I want to subclass <code>NSMutableArray</code> to make a <code>SortedMutableArray</code> that always maintains itself in a sorted state.  So I subclassed <code>NSMutableArray</code> in the usual manner, adding a <code>NSComparator</code> property that determines the sort order.  I overrode the <code>addObject:</code> method to insert objects in a sorted manner:</p>

<pre><code>- (void) addObject:(id)anObject {
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; [self count]; ++i) {
        NSComparisonResult result = (NSComparisonResult)self.comparator([self objectAtIndex:i], anObject); 
        if (result == NSOrderedDescending || result == NSOrderedSame) {
            [super insertObject:anObject atIndex:i];
            break;
        }
        else {
            if (result != NSOrderedAscending) {
                [NSException raise:@""InvalidBlockException"" format:@""Block must return one of NSOrderedDescending, NSOrderedAscending, or NSOrderedSame""];
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>and everything compiles great.  But when I run the program, I get an error indicating that <code>insertObject:atIndex:</code> is now abstract and needs to be implemented.  Reading the documentation, it lists several methods that must be implemented in any subclass of <code>NSMutableArray</code>, one of which is indeed <code>insertObject:atIndex:</code>.  But I don't need to change the functionality of <code>insertObject:atIndex:</code>; I want it to word exactly as it does in <code>NSMutableArray</code>.  Is there a way that I can do this (in general, too, not just for this specific problem)?  Why must certain methods be implemented in subclasses like this?  Doesn't that kind of defeat one of the purposes of inheritance, code reuse?  I've never seen anything like this in other languages, where a method is concrete in a superclass but becomes abstract when it is subclassed.  Does this pattern/concept have a name?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for any help, and I'm sorry if I'm duplicating another question, but I didn't know what to search for other than ""subclass"" in the objective-c tag, which gave too many results to find what I was looking for.</p>
","115730","","<p>Bad idea.  <code>NSArray</code> is actually a <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CocoaFundamentals/CocoaDesignPatterns/CocoaDesignPatterns.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002974-CH6-SW32"">class cluster</a> (which is our word for [essentially] an abstract factory).  This means that when you <code>alloc</code>/<code>init</code> an <code>NSArray</code>, you don't actually get an <code>NSArray</code> back.  You get (usually) an <code>NSCFArray</code>, which is a private subclass.</p>

<p><code>NSMutableArray</code> is the same deal (it's abstract).  When you <code>alloc</code>/<code>init</code> an <code>NSMutableArray</code>, you get an <code>NSCFArray</code> back that has a little internal mutable bit flipped.</p>

<p>The upshot of this is that subclass a class cluster is generally discouraged, because it's a bit more complex than just creating a normal subclass.</p>

<p>The commented out portion of the search part in the above method works but crayonColors is just a simple NSMutableDictionary of NSStrings and does not have arrays nested inside of it.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>
","115730","","<p>As far as I'm aware, you can't do this with a single predicate.  However, you can do it with a key-path operator and a predicate in two separate calls.</p>

<p>So, you have an array of arrays of terms.  You want a single array of terms where its name contains 'A' (for example).  Here's what you do:</p>

<pre><code>NSArray * allTerms = ...; //your array of arrays of terms
NSArray * collapsedTerms = [allTerms valueForKeyPath:@""@unionOfArrays.self""];

NSPredicate * filter = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@""name CONTAINS[cd] %@"", @""A""];
NSArray * filteredTerms = [collapsedTerms filteredArrayUsingPredicate:filter];
</code></pre>

<p>The magic here is the <code>valueForKeyPath:</code> bit.  The <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/KeyValueCoding/Concepts/ArrayOperators.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20002176-178611""><code>@unionOfArrays</code> operator</a> takes an array of arrays of objects, and returns an array of objects.  Here's what it's doing:  The <code>NSArray</code> is going to break the keypath up by <code>.</code>, giving it <code>@unionOfArrays</code> and <code>self</code>.  It's going to recurse and invoke <code>valueForKeyPath:</code> on itself using the second bit (self), and it's going to get back an array of arrays.  It's then going to mash all those arrays together into a single array, ignoring duplicates.  (If you want to remove duplicates, use <code>@distinctUnionOfArrays</code> instead)</p>

<p>Once we have that array of objects, we can then filter it normally using a simple <code>name CONTAINS 'blah'</code> predicate.</p>

<p>(I thought I might be able to get this to work using a <code>SUBQUERY</code>, but that's a strange beast and nothing was immediately obvious to me.)</p>

<p>For the super intrepid, you could do this with a single method call using KickingBear's collection extensions (<a href=""http://kickingbear.com/blog/archives/9"">available here</a>), but I would strongly advise against using hacks like that in a production setting. :)</p>

"<p>UPDATE | I've uploaded a sample project using the panel and crashing here: <a href=""http://w3style.co.uk/~d11wtq/BlocksCrash.tar.gz"" rel=""nofollow"">http://w3style.co.uk/~d11wtq/BlocksCrash.tar.gz</a> (I know the ""Choose..."" button does nothing, I've not implemented it yet).</p>

<p>UPDATE 2 | Just discovered I don't even have to invoke anything on <code>newFilePanel</code> in order to cause a crash, I merely need to use it in a statement.</p>

<p>This also causes a crash:</p>

<pre><code>[newFilePanel beginSheetModalForWindow:[windowController window] completionHandler:^(NSInteger result) {
    newFilePanel; // Do nothing, just use the variable in an expression
}];
</code></pre>

<p>It appears the last thing dumped to the console is sometimes this: ""Unable to disassemble dyld_stub_objc_msgSend_stret."", and sometimes this: ""Cannot access memory at address 0xa"".</p>

<p>I've created my own sheet (an NSPanel subclass), that tries to provide an API similar to NSOpenPanel/NSSavePanel, in that it presents itself as a sheet and invokes a block when done.</p>

<p>Here's the interface:</p>

<pre><code>//
//  EDNewFilePanel.h
//  MojiBaker

//  Created by Chris Corbyn on 29/12/10.
//  Copyright 2010 Chris Corbyn. All rights reserved.

#import &lt;Cocoa/Cocoa.h&gt;

@class EDNewFilePanel;

@interface EDNewFilePanel : NSPanel &lt;NSTextFieldDelegate&gt; {
    BOOL allowsRelativePaths;

    NSTextField *filenameInput;

    NSButton *relativePathSwitch;

    NSTextField *localPathLabel;
    NSTextField *localPathInput;
    NSButton *chooseButton;

    NSButton *createButton;
    NSButton *cancelButton;
}

@property (nonatomic) BOOL allowsRelativePaths;

+(EDNewFilePanel *)newFilePanel;

-(void)beginSheetModalForWindow:(NSWindow *)aWindow completionHandler:(void (^)(NSInteger result))handler;
-(void)setFileName:(NSString *)fileName;
-(NSString *)fileName;
-(void)setLocalPath:(NSString *)localPath;
-(NSString *)localPath;
-(BOOL)isRelative;

@end
</code></pre>

<p>And the key methods inside the implementation:</p>

<pre><code>-(void)beginSheetModalForWindow:(NSWindow *)aWindow completionHandler:(void (^)(NSInteger result))handler {
    [NSApp beginSheet:self
       modalForWindow:aWindow
        modalDelegate:self
       didEndSelector:@selector(sheetDidEnd:returnCode:contextInfo:)
          contextInfo:(void *)[handler retain]];
}

-(void)dismissSheet:(id)sender {
    [NSApp endSheet:self returnCode:([sender tag] == 1) ? NSOKButton : NSCancelButton];
}

-(void)sheetDidEnd:(NSWindow *)aSheet returnCode:(NSInteger)result contextInfo:(void *)contextInfo {
    ((void (^)(NSUInteger result))contextInfo)(result);
    [self orderOut:self];
    [(void (^)(NSUInteger result))contextInfo release];
}
</code></pre>

<p>This all works provided my block is just a no-op with an empty body.  My block in invoked when the sheet is dismissed.</p>

<pre><code>EDNewFilePanel *newFilePanel = [EDNewFilePanel newFilePanel];
[newFilePanel setAllowsRelativePaths:[self hasSelectedItems]];
[newFilePanel setLocalPath:@""~/""];
[newFilePanel beginSheetModalForWindow:[windowController window] completionHandler:^(NSInteger result) {
    NSLog(@""I got invoked!"");
}];
</code></pre>

<p>But as soon as I try to access the panel from inside the block, I crash with EXC_BAD_ACCESS.  For example, this crashes:</p>

<pre><code>EDNewFilePanel *newFilePanel = [EDNewFilePanel newFilePanel];
[newFilePanel setAllowsRelativePaths:[self hasSelectedItems]];
[newFilePanel setLocalPath:@""~/""];
[newFilePanel beginSheetModalForWindow:[windowController window] completionHandler:^(NSInteger result) {
    NSLog(@""I got invoked and the panel is %@!"", newFilePanel);
}];
</code></pre>

<p>It's not clear from the debugger with the cause is.  The first item (zero 0) on the stack just says ""??"" and there's nothing listed.</p>

<p>The next items (1 and 2) in the stack are the calls to <code>-endSheet:returnCode:</code> and <code>-dismissSheet:</code> respectively.  Looking through the variables in the debugger, nothing seems amiss/out of scope.</p>

<p>I had thought that maybe the panel had been released (since it's autoreleased), yet even calling <code>-retain</code> on it right after creating it doesn't help.</p>

<p>Am I implementing this wrong?</p>
","115730","","<p>It's a little odd for you to <code>retain</code> a parameter in one method and <code>release</code> it in another, when that object is not an instance variable.</p>

<p>I would recommend making the <code>completionHandler</code> bit of your <code>beginSheet</code> stuff an instance variable.  It's not like you'd be able to display the sheet more than once at a time anyway, and it would be cleaner this way.</p>

<p>Also, your <code>EXC_BAD_ACCESS</code> is most likely coming from the <code>[handler retain]</code> call in your <code>beginSheet:</code> method.  You're probably invoking this method with something like (for brevity):</p>

<pre><code>[myObject doThingWithCompletionHandler:^{ NSLog(@""done!""); }];
</code></pre>

<p>If that's the case, you <em>must</em> <code>-copy</code> the block instead of retaining it.  The block, as typed above, lives on the stack.  However, if that stack frame is popped off the execution stack, then that block is gone.  <em>poof</em>  Any attempt to access the block later will result in a crash, because you're trying to execute code that no longer exists and has been replaced by garbage.  As such, you must invoke <code>copy</code> on the block to move it to the heap, where it can live beyond the lifetime of the stack frame in which it was created.</p>

<p>I was thinking; can't I just remove the <code>@property</code>'s? I did, and I could still connect my instance variables (with <code>IBOutlet</code>) in Interface Builder.</p>

<p>So my question now is; <strong>is there any use for properties in combination with Interface Builder, or is it OK to leave them out?</strong> Is it required for some memory management or something? Or are they really just for use in your own code?</p>

<p>And if I do leave them out, do I still need to <code>release</code> them in <code>dealloc</code>?</p>
","115730","","<p>They're not necessary, but they're strongly encouraged for the simple fact that they clarify memory management. </p>

<p>For example, if you declare an outlet via the ivar, then what is its retain policy? Is it retained? Is it autoreleased? Are you the owner? Does someone else also own it? There is a lot of ambiguity there (especially with those accursed top level objects, which behave differently on the Mac than on the iPhone).</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you declare the outlet via a property, there is no ambiguity, because the memory management policy is directly stated in the declaration. In addition with the presence of the property, the nib unarchiving will see the setter and use that, thereby ensuring that nothing strange is going on with transferring object ownership, etc. </p>

<p>In a nutshell, you can declare outlets without using <code>@property</code> (which we all had to do before they were introduced in 10.5), but there's no good reason to <em>not</em> use them. They really make the code a lot clearer as to what exactly is going on. </p>

"<p>So the other day I was sick of typing out repetetive addTarget:action:forControlEvents:s, and macros are only entertaining for so long, so I did this:</p>

<pre><code>@implementation UIControl (xx)
-(void)addTarget:(id)target action:(SEL)action
 {
 [self addTarget:target action:action forControlEvents:UIControlEventTouchUpInside];
 }
@end
</code></pre>

<p><strong>and simply added it at the top of the .m file in question.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Works great of course, but notice the ""xx"".</strong></p>

<p><em><strong>What's the best thing to NAME a ""nameless"" Category like this?</em></strong></p>

<p>Note that it really <strong><em>NEEDS NO NAME as the name will never be used ANYWHERE. The best thing would be to give it no name</em></strong> - but syntactically you cannot leave that blank.</p>

<p>(If you leave the xx blank - it becomes an ""Extension"" which is quite different.)</p>

<p>I was thinking maybe:  </p>

<ul>
<li>a single underscore  </li>
<li>the name of the class again identically  </li>
<li>""quick""  </li>
<li>perhaps the name of the class in this file (as in ""quick extra routines for UIControl in CherryBomb"") - so it would be UIControl(CherryBomb), i.e., to remind you that these extra routines are handy for CherryBomb and are indeed in the file CherryBomb.m  </li>
<li>""x""</li>
<li>your or your company's initials (use the same ""quick"" Category name everywhere)  </li>
<li>""ThisTextNeverUsedAnywhere""</li>
</ul>

<p>(By the way ... it appears you <em>do not</em> actually need to include an interface for such a Category, i.e. you can omit...</p>

<pre><code>//you can actually get away without these lines...
//#import &lt;UIKit/UIControl.h&gt;
//@interface  UIControl (x)
//-(void)addTarget:(id)target action:(SEL)action;
//@end
</code></pre>

<p>... that part and it works fine.)</p>

<p>For people who love Categories, and who doesn't, what's the answer to this troubling question?</p>

<p>What should you name a ""nameless"" Category <strong><em>where the name is never going to be used again and is irrelevant</em></strong>, because the text is typed directly only in the top of one .m file for use only in that file?</p>
","115730","","<p>If it's a quick, off-the-cuff category, then I'll call it something like <code>DDAdditions</code>.  If it's supposed to be a bit more formal, then I'll figure out what the defining purpose of the category is and construct a name off that.</p>

<p><strong>edit</strong> more information:</p>

<p>Here's what I do:</p>

<p>When I name the file that contains the category, it is always of the form:</p>

<pre><code>BaseClass+CategoryName.h/m
</code></pre>

<p>So if I have a <code>UIButton</code> category called <code>FooBar</code>, the name of the file is <code>UIButton+FooBar.h/m</code>.  Seeing this construct in my source tree instantly tells me 2 (potentially 3) things:</p>

<ol>
<li>That I'm extending a class</li>
<li>What class I'm extending</li>
<li>What the purpose of the extensions is (if the category name is descriptive enough)</li>
</ol>

<p>If I'm declaring multiple categories in a single file, then the ""BaseClass"" bit can vary depending on how the extended classes are related.</p>

<ol>
<li>If there's a mutable-immutable relation (ie, I'm extending both <code>NSArray</code> and <code>NSMutableArray</code> with a category that offers both immutable and mutable variants [ex: <code>-[NSArray shuffledArray]</code> and <code>-[NSMutableArray shuffle]</code>]), then I'll simply use <code>NSArray</code> as the base class.</li>
<li>If there's a kind relation (the things I'm extending are both collections), then I'll try and come up with a base name that reflects that relation, like <code>Collections+CategoryName.h/m</code>.</li>
<li>If I can't come up with a way that the categories are related, then they shouldn't be in the same file.  Using a single file for ""the categories that just add little things here and there with no defining purpose"" is (in my opinion) wrong.  File names, like method names, should reflect the purpose of the file.</li>
</ol>

<p>Coming up with a proper category name takes practice.  If I'm in a hurry or am just adding a category to try something out, I'll use ""DDAdditions"" (my initials + ""Additions"").  If I'm using a category to hide methods on a class, I'll go with something like ""Private"" or ""Internal"".</p>

<p>Otherwise, I find the purpose of these methods and construct a name out of that.</p>

<p>For example, if I'm adding a method to <code>NSDictionary</code> to take its key-value pairs and URL encode them as a query string, then I'll call the category <code>DDURLAdditions</code> or <code>DDURLEncoding</code> or something like that.</p>

<p>The over-arching principle here is to be descriptive.  Really it doesn't matter what you call your category or what you name your file as long as its clear what they are.  (One of the things we love about Objective-C is that its verbosity makes it largely self-documenting)  The only other thing to watch out for is to make sure that your category doesn't have the same name as another category for that same class.  (and also that your method names don't conflict, etc)</p>

"<p>Is it possible to pass an Objective-C block for the <code>@selector</code> argument in a <code>UIButton</code>?  i.e., Is there any way to get the following to work?</p>

","115730","","<p>Yes, but you'd have to use a category.</p>

- (void) addEventHandler:(void(^)(void))handler 
        forControlEvents:(UIControlEvents)controlEvents;

</code></pre>

<p>The implementation would be a bit trickier:</p>

<pre><code>#import &lt;objc/runtime.h&gt;

@interface DDBlockActionWrapper : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, copy) void (^blockAction)(void);
- (void) invokeBlock:(id)sender;
@end

@implementation DDBlockActionWrapper
@synthesize blockAction;
- (void) dealloc {
  [self setBlockAction:nil];
  [super dealloc];
}

- (void) invokeBlock:(id)sender {
  [self blockAction]();
}
@end

@implementation UIControl (DDBlockActions)

static const char * UIControlDDBlockActions = ""unique"";

- (void) addEventHandler:(void(^)(void))handler 
        forControlEvents:(UIControlEvents)controlEvents {

  NSMutableArray * blockActions = 
                 objc_getAssociatedObject(self, &amp;UIControlDDBlockActions);

  if (blockActions == nil) {
    blockActions = [NSMutableArray array];
    objc_setAssociatedObject(self, &amp;UIControlDDBlockActions, 
                                        blockActions, OBJC_ASSOCIATION_RETAIN);
  }

  DDBlockActionWrapper * target = [[DDBlockActionWrapper alloc] init];
  [target setBlockAction:handler];
  [blockActions addObject:target];

  [self addTarget:target action:@selector(invokeBlock:) forControlEvents:controlEvents];
  [target release];

}

@end
</code></pre>

<p>Some explanation:</p>

<ol>
<li>We're using a custom ""internal only"" class called <code>DDBlockActionWrapper</code>.  This is a simple class that has a block property (the block we want to get invoked), and a method that simply invokes that block.</li>
<li>The <code>UIControl</code> category simply instantiates one of these wrappers, gives it the block to be invoked, and then tells itself to use that wrapper and its <code>invokeBlock:</code> method as the target and action (as normal).</li>
<li>The <code>UIControl</code> category uses an associated object to store an array of <code>DDBlockActionWrappers</code>, because <code>UIControl</code> does not retain its targets.  This array is to ensure that the blocks exist when they're supposed to be invoked.</li>
<li><strike>We have to ensure that the <code>DDBlockActionWrappers</code> get cleaned up when the object is destroyed, so we're doing a nasty hack of swizzling out <code>-[UIControl dealloc]</code> with a new one that removes the associated object, and then invokes the original <code>dealloc</code> code.  Tricky, tricky.</strike>  Actually, <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjectiveC/Articles/ocAssociativeReferences.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001163-CH24-SW3"">associated objects are cleaned up automatically during deallocation</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Finally, this code was typed in the browser and has not been compiled.  There are probably some things wrong with it.  Your mileage may vary.</p>

"<p>From the Blocks documentation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In a reference-counted environment, by
  default when you reference an
  Objective-C object within a block, it
  is retained. This is true even if you
  simply reference an instance variable
  of the object.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am trying to implement a completion handler pattern, where a block is given to an object before the work is performed and the block is executed by the receiver after the work is performed.  Since I am being a good memory citizen, the block should own the objects it references in the completion handler and then they will be released when the block goes out of scope.  I know enough to know that I must <code>copy</code> the block to move it to the heap since the block will survive the stack scope in which it was declared.</p>

<p>However, one of my objects is getting deallocated unexpectedly.  After some playing around, it appears that certain objects are not retained when the block is copied to the heap, while other objects are.  I am not sure what I am doing wrong.  Here's the smallest test case I can produce:</p>

<pre><code>typedef void (^ActionBlock)(UIView*);
</code></pre>

<p>In the scope of some method:</p>

<pre><code>NSObject *o = [[[NSObject alloc] init] autorelease];
mailViewController = [[[MFMailComposeViewController alloc] init] autorelease];
NSLog(@""o's retain count is %d"",[o retainCount]);
NSLog(@""mailViewController's retain count is %d"",[mailViewController retainCount]);
ActionBlock myBlock = ^(UIView *view) {
       [mailViewController setCcRecipients:[NSArray arrayWithObjects:@""test@recipient.com"",nil]];
       [o class];
    };
NSLog(@""mailViewController's retain count after the block is %d"",[mailViewController retainCount]);
NSLog(@""o's retain count after the block is %d"",[o retainCount]);
Block_copy(myBlock);
NSLog(@""o's retain count after the copy is %d"",[o retainCount]);
NSLog(@""mailViewController's retain count after the copy is %d"",[mailViewController retainCount]);
</code></pre>

<p>I expect both objects to be retained by the block at some point, and I certainly expect their retain counts to be identical.  Instead, I get this output:</p>

<pre><code>o's retain count is 1
mailViewController's retain count is 1
mailViewController's retain count after the block is 1
o's retain count after the block is 1
o's retain count after the copy is 2
mailViewController's retain count after the copy is 1
</code></pre>

<p><code>o</code> (subclass of <code>NSObject</code>) is getting retained properly and will not go out of scope.  However <code>mailViewController</code> is not retained and will be deallocated before the block is run, causing a crash.</p>
","115730","","<h1>Do not use -retainCount.</h1>

<p>The absolute retain count of an object is meaningless.</p>

<p>You should call <code>release</code> exactly same number of times that you caused the object to be retained.  No less (unless you like leaks) and, certainly, no more (unless you like crashes).</p>

<p>See the <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/MemoryMgmt/Articles/mmRules.html%23//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000994-BAJHFBGH"" rel=""nofollow"">Memory Management Guidelines</a> for full details.</p>

<p>(cribbed from one of @bbum's answers)</p>

<hr>

<p>As for your question:</p>

<p>Are you actually observing a crash?  Or are you just shooting blindly from the hip and thinking that it might crash?</p>

<p>From the code you posted, it would appear that <code>mailViewController</code> is an instance variable, in which case the block would be retaining <code>self</code> instead of the instance variable.  And since you <code>autoreleased</code> your instance variable, it's getting cleaned up by an <code>NSAutoreleasePool</code> just like you'd expect.</p>

<p>So in summary:</p>

<ol>
<li>Do not use <code>-retainCount</code>.</li>
<li>Do not <code>autorelease</code> instance variables that you want to exist beyond this turn of the run loop.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>edit</strong> A bit more clarification:</p>

<p>Here's what's going to happen when your block is created:</p>

<ol>
<li>Inspect object references in its scope.  There are two:  <code>self-&gt;mailViewController</code> and <code>o</code>.</li>
<li><code>self-&gt;mailViewController</code> is a member of a struct (<code>self</code>), so it is not retained directly.  Retain <code>self</code> instead.</li>
<li><code>o</code> is a local variable.  Retain it.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is proper behavior.  As for your code...</p>

<ol>
<li><code>o</code> is created with a +0 retain count</li>
<li><code>self-&gt;mailViewController</code> is created with a +0 retain count</li>
<li><code>myBlock</code> is created with a +0 retain count.  <code>o</code> now has a +1 RC, as does <code>self</code>.  <code>self-&gt;mailViewController</code> still has a +0 RC</li>
<li><code>myBlock</code> is copied => +1 retain count</li>
</ol>

<p>Fast forward to the end of this run loop cycle.</p>

<ol>
<li>The current autorelease pool is drained.  All objects with a +0 retain count are deallocated, including <code>self-&gt;mailViewController</code>.  <code>self-&gt;mailViewController</code> now points to deallocated memory, and is essentially garbage.</li>
</ol>

<p>Fast forward to some future point when <code>myBlock</code> is executed</p>

<ol>
<li><code>myBlock</code> attempts to invoke a method on <code>self-&gt;mailViewController</code>.  However, <code>self-&gt;mailViewController</code> no longer points to a valid object, and your app crashes.</li>
</ol>

<p>However, if <code>mailViewController</code> is not an instance variable, then we need to see more code.  I think it'd be highly unlikely that the behavior you're seeing is a problem with the blocks runtime, but it is possible.</p>

<p>What would you recommend between building a framework, a static library, or another solution to accomplish this and why?</p>
","115730","","<p>If you're distributing for iOS, you have two options:</p>

<ol>

<p>Since you're asking about hiding stuff, I don't think #2 is what you're looking for.</p>

<p>As for #1, the best you can do is just not tell 3rd party users about more stuff.  They'll still be able to use the runtime to find methods and properties and instance variables, etc.  If you're doing everything in C-land (ie, no Objective-C classes), then they can still use things like <code>otool</code> to dump symbols.</p>

<p>In short:</p>

<p>It's probably not worth trying to ""obfuscate"" your code.  Just tell them about the stuff they need to know about, then give them a .a file and the headers they need.</p>

"<p>I'm working on an iPhone app using objective C.  I've got class A, which creates an NSMutableArray pointer called ""list"".  But, in class A, I never create an object for it to point to.  Instead, I call a class method in class B, to get some data from an sqlite database, and populate an NSMutableArray object there. I want to be able to set the pointer in class A to point to the NSMutableArray object created in the class B method by passing it as an argument to the method.  I can't do it by returning the array because I want to return the sqlite result.</p>

<p>I wonder if I'm doing this right?  I haven't written the entire method yet (when it's done it'll be pretty long), but I want to know if I'm doing the pointer stuff correctly before I get started on the rest.</p>

<pre><code>//ClassA.m

//...
NSMutableArray *list;
[ClassB populateArrayFromSqlite:&amp;list];
//Now do stuff with ""list"", which should point to the array created in populateArrayFromSqlite
//...

//ClassB.m
+(int)populateArrayFromSqlite:(NSMutableArray**)ar {
    NSMutableArray *array = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init];
    //Here there will be code that populates the array using sqlite (once I write it)
    //And then I need to set the ""list"" pointer in ClassA.m to point to this array
    ar = &amp;array; //Is this how?

    return resultFromSqlite;
}

<p>Did I do it right? Or am I not understanding something? I guess this pointer-to-pointer stuff just doesn't click with me yet. After reading a few general sources about pointers, I suspect this is how I'd do it but part of me doesn't understand why the ar argument can't just be a regular pointer (as opposed to a pointer-to-pointer).</p>
","115730","","<p>Changing pointers to objects like this is fairly uncommon in Objective-C.  The main time we see stuff like this is when a method has a potential for failure, at which point we'll pass in a pointer to an <code>NSError</code> reference.  For example, <code>NSFileManager</code>'s <code>- (BOOL)removeItemAtPath:(NSString *)path error:(NSError **)error</code>.</p>

"<p>I want to extend or add another method to an existing protocol. Although the protocol in particular is not important, this is what I am trying to do.</p>

<pre><code>@protocol NSMatrixDelegate

</code></pre>

<p>The compiler warns that I have a duplicate declaration of the same protocol. How would I do this properly?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
","115730","","<p>You can't define categories for protocols.  There are 2 ways around this:</p>

<ul>
<li>use a new formal protocol</li>
<li>use an informal protocol and runtime checking</li>
</ul>

<h1>Formal Protocol</h1>

<p>Defining a new formal protocol would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>@protocol MyCustomMatrixDelegate &lt;NSMatrixDelegate&gt;

- (void) myNewMethod:(id)sender;

@end
</code></pre>

<p>Then you would make your custom class conform to <code>&lt;MyCustomMatrixDelegate&gt;</code> instead of <code>&lt;NSMatrixDelegate&gt;</code>.  If you use this approach, there's something to be aware of:  <code>[self delegate]</code> will likely be declared as <code>id&lt;NSMatrixDelegate&gt;</code>.  This means that you can't do <code>[[self delegate] myNewMethod:obj]</code>, because <code>&lt;NSMatrixDelegate&gt;</code> does not declare the <code>myNewMethod:</code> method.</p>

<p>The way around this is to retype the <code>delegate</code> object via casting.  Maybe something like:</p>

<pre><code>- (id&lt;MyCustomMatrixDelegate&gt;) customDelegate {
  return (id&lt;MyCustomMatrixDelegate&gt;)[self delegate];
}
</code></pre>

<p>(However, you might want to do some type checking first, like:</p>

<pre><code>if ([[self delegate] conformsToProtocol:@protocol(MyCustomMatrixDelegate)]) {
  return (id&lt;MyCustomMatrixDelegate&gt;)[self delegate];
}
return nil;
</code></pre>

<p>)</p>

<p>And then you'd do:</p>

<pre><code>[[self customDelegate] myNewMethod:obj];
</code></pre>

<h1>Informal Protocol</h1>

<p>This is really a fancy name for a category on <code>NSObject</code>:</p>

<pre><code>@interface NSObject (MyCustomMatrixDelegate)

- (void) myNewMethod:(id)sender;

@end
</code></pre>

<p>Then you just don't implement the method.  In your class that would send the method, you'd do:</p>

<pre><code>if ([[self delegate] respondsToSelector:@selector(myNewMethod:)]) {
  [[self delegate] myNewMethod:someSenderValue];
}
</code></pre>

"<p>I would like to know in what situation did you use <code>-retainCount</code> so far, and eventually the problems that can happen using it.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
","115730","","<p>You should never use <code>-retainCount</code>, because it never tells you anything useful.  The implementation of the Foundation and AppKit/UIKit frameworks is opaque; you don't know what's being retained, why it's being retained, who's retaining it, when it was retained, and so on.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>You'd think that <code>[NSNumber numberWithInt:1]</code> would have a <code>retainCount</code> of 1.  It doesn't.  It's 2.</li>
<li>You'd think that <code>@""Foo""</code> would have a <code>retainCount</code> of 1.  It doesn't.  It's 1152921504606846975.</li>
<li>You'd think that <code>[NSString stringWithString:@""Foo""]</code> would have a <code>retainCount</code> of 1.  It doesn't.  Again, it's 1152921504606846975.</li>
</ul>

<p>Basically, since anything can retain an object (and therefore alter its <code>retainCount</code>), and since you don't have the source to most of the code that runs an application, an object's <code>retainCount</code> is meaningless.</p>

<p>If you're trying to track down why an object isn't getting deallocated, use the Leaks tool in Instruments.  If you're trying to track down why an object was deallocated too soon, use the Zombies tool in Instruments.</p>

<p>But don't use <code>-retainCount</code>.  It's a truly worthless method.</p>

<p><strong>edit</strong></p>

<p>Please everyone go to <a href=""http://bugreport.apple.com"">http://bugreport.apple.com</a> and request that <code>-retainCount</code> be deprecated.  The more people that ask for it, the better.</p>

<p><strong>edit #2</strong></p>

<p>As an update,<code>[NSNumber numberWithInt:1]</code> now has a <code>retainCount</code> of 9223372036854775807.  If your code was expecting it to be 2, your code has now broken.</p>

","115730","","<p><code>-[NSURL path]</code> is not doing what you're expecting.</p>

<p>If I have the URL <code>http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4636428</code>, then it's <code>-path</code> is <code>/questions/4636428</code>.  When you pass that path to CHCSVParser, it's going to try and open that path on the local system.  Since that file doesn't exist, you won't be able to open it.</p>

<p>What you need to do (as Walter points out) is download the CSV file locally, and then open it.  You can download the file in several different ways (<code>+[NSString stringWithContentsOfURL:...]</code>, <code>NSURLConnection</code>, etc).  Once you've got either the file saved locally to disk or the string of CSV in memory, you can then pass it to the parser.</p>

<p>If this is a very big file, then you'll want to <code>alloc</code>/<code>init</code> a <code>CHCSVParser</code> with the path to the local copy of the CSV file.  The parser will then read through it bit by bit and tell you what it finds via the delegate callbacks.</p>

<p>If the CSV file isn't very big, then you can do:</p>

<pre><code>NSString * csv = ...; //the NSString containing the contents of the CSV file
NSArray * rows = [csv CSVComponents];
</code></pre>

<p>That will return an <code>NSArray</code> of <code>NSArrays</code> of <code>NSStrings</code>.</p>

<p>Similar to this last approach is using the <code>NSArray</code> category method:</p>

<pre><code>NSString * csv = ...;
NSError * error = nil;
NSArray * rows = [NSArray arrayWithContentsOfCSVString:csv encoding:[csv fastestEncoding] error:&amp;error];
</code></pre>

<p>This will return the same structure (an <code>NSArray</code> of <code>NSArrays</code> of <code>NSStrings</code>), but it will also provide you with an <code>NSError</code> object if it encounters a syntax error in the CSV file (ie, malformed CSV).</p>

<p>That is not a retained instance variable; it's autoreleased. This means it will be reallocated by the next time the run loop spins, and is the source of your crash. </p>

"<p>How to convert a gregorian date into the equivalent hebrew date?
Also please tell about these calendars as I am not having much knowledge of these.</p>
","115730","","<p>There's a handy class called <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/cocoa/reference/foundation/Classes/NSCalendar_Class/Reference/NSCalendar.html""><code>NSCalendar</code></a>.  You create one like this:</p>

<pre><code>NSCalendar * gregorian = [[NSCalendar alloc] initWithCalendarIdentifier:NSGregorianCalendar];
NSCalendar * hebrew = [[NSCalendar alloc] initWithCalendarIdentifier:NSHebrewCalendar];
</code></pre>

<p>Once you've got the calendar objects, you can use them to convert a date around to various representations:</p>

<pre><code>NSDate * date = [NSDate date];
NSDateComponents * components = [gregorian components:NSUIntegerMax fromDate:date];
NSDate * hebrewDate = [hebrew dateFromComponents:components];

NSLog(@""date: %@"", date);
NSLog(@""hebrew: %@"", hebrewDate);
</code></pre>

<p>On my machine, this logs:</p>

<pre><code>date: 2011-01-09 23:20:39 -0800
hebrew: 1751-09-25 23:20:39 -0800
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to convert stuff to a more readable format, you use <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/cocoa/reference/Foundation/Classes/NSDateFormatter_Class/Reference/Reference.html""><code>NSDateFormatter</code></a>:</p>

<pre><code>NSDateFormatter * formatter = [[NSDateFormatter alloc] init];
[formatter setDateStyle:NSDateFormatterLongStyle];
[formatter setTimeStyle:NSDateFormatterNoStyle];
[formatter setCalendar:gregorian]; //this is usually unnecessary; it's here for clarity

NSLog(@""date: %@"", [formatter stringFromDate:date]);

[formatter setCalendar:hebrew];

NSLog(@""hebrew: %@"", [formatter stringFromDate:hebrewDate]);
[formatter release];
</code></pre>

<p>This logs:</p>

<pre><code>date: January 9, 2011
hebrew: Tishri 9, 2011
</code></pre>

<p>It would appear that <code>NSDateFormatter</code> is using the gregorian date, but at least it's got the right month name, right? </p>

<p><strong>edit</strong></p>

<p>Actually, I goofed.  If you just set the calendar of the <code>NSDateFormatter</code>, you don't have to worry about converting the date at all.  See:</p>

<pre><code>NSDateFormatter * formatter = [[NSDateFormatter alloc] init];
[formatter setDateStyle:NSDateFormatterLongStyle];
[formatter setTimeStyle:NSDateFormatterNoStyle];
[formatter setCalendar:hebrew];

"<p>In Objctive-C when you declare an instance variable you can check if it conforms to a protocol on assignment at compile time like so:</p>

"<p>I was going through the AVCam project from WWDC and I'm curious about the following code. I thought you were supposed to declare an object, then @property (nonatomic,retain), then synthesize. </p>

</code></pre>
","115730","","<pre><code>@property (nonatomic,readonly,retain) AVCaptureSession *session;
</code></pre>

<p>This is a property that is <code>readonly</code> externally.  Internally, it will have a setter that retains the new value.</p>

<pre><code>@property (nonatomic,assign) AVCaptureVideoOrientation orientation;
</code></pre>

<p>This is a property that does a simple assignment to store the new value (since you can't <code>-copy</code> or <code>-retain</code> primitives).</p>

<pre><code>@property (nonatomic,readonly,retain) AVCaptureAudioChannel *audioChannel;
</code></pre>

<p>This is a property that is <code>readonly</code> externally.  Internally, it will have a setter that retains the new value.</p>

<pre><code>@property (nonatomic,assign) NSString *sessionPreset;
</code></pre>

<p>This is a property that does a simple assignment to store the new string value.  This is normally not a good idea, unless you're only allowing pre-defined constants for the presets.  When dealing with <code>NSString</code> properties, you generally want them to be <code>copy</code> unless you have a good reason against it.</p>

<p>In the implementation file:</p>

<pre><code>@property (nonatomic,retain) AVCaptureSession *session;
@property (nonatomic,retain) AVCaptureDeviceInput *videoInput;
@property (nonatomic,retain) AVCaptureDeviceInput *audioInput;
</code></pre>

<p>These are used in conjunction with the properties declared in the header, except now it's <code>readwrite</code>.  By declaring the version in the header as <code>readonly</code>, anyone using the class will not have access to the <code>setSession:</code> method.  We re-declare this property internally so that we can have access to the setter (and the setter retains the new value).  Also, if the property is not present in the header, the user won't know it exists, but we'll still be able to use it internally.</p>

<pre><code>@synthesize session = _session;
@synthesize orientation = _orientation;
</code></pre>

<p>This means you want the compiler to generate the appropriate setters and getters for the <code>session</code> and <code>orientation</code> properties, and that you want those properties to store their values in the <code>_session</code> and <code>_orientation</code> instance variables, respectively.</p>

<pre><code>@dynamic audioChannel;
@dynamic sessionPreset;
@dynamic focusMode;
</code></pre>

<p>This means that the implementations for the setters and getters will be provided at runtime.  You usually don't use <code>@dynamic</code> properties yourself, other than the ones provided by the Core Data framework.</p>

"<p>In my app, I want to export a SQLite database file to CSV file..</p>

Thanks.</p>
","115730","","<p>First, you'll want to make sure that you're using <a href=""http://github.com/ccgus/fmdb"">FMDB</a> to access the database, because people who use the SQLite C API directly in Objective-C are masochists.  You can do that like this:</p>

<pre><code>FMDatabase *db = [[FMDatabase alloc] initWithPath:@""/path/to/db/file""];
FMResultSet *results = [db executeQuery:@""SELECT * FROM tableName""];
while([results nextRow]) {
  NSDictionary *resultRow = [results resultDict];
  NSArray *orderedKeys = [[resultRow allKeys] sortedArrayUsingSelector:@selector(compare:)];
  //iterate over the dictionary
}

<p>As for writing to a CSV file, well <a href=""http://github.com/davedelong/CHCSVParser"">there's code for that too</a>:</p>

<pre><code>#import ""CHCSV.h""

CHCSVWriter * csvWriter = [[CHCSVWriter alloc] initWithCSVFile:@""/path/to/csv/file"" atomic:NO];

//write stuff
[csvWriter closeFile];
[csvWriter release];
</code></pre>

<p>And to combine them, you'd do:</p>

<pre><code>FMDatabase *db = [[FMDatabase alloc] initWithPath:@""/path/to/db/file""];
if (![db open]) {
  //couldn't open the database
  [db release];
  return nil;
}
FMResultSet *results = [db executeQuery:@""SELECT * FROM tableName""];
CHCSVWriter *csvWriter = [[CHCSVWriter alloc] initWithCSVFile:@""/path/to/csv/file"" atomic:NO];
while([results nextRow]) {
  NSDictionary *resultRow = [results resultDict];
  NSArray *orderedKeys = [[resultRow allKeys] sortedArrayUsingSelector:@selector(compare:)];
  //iterate over the dictionary
  for (NSString *columnName in orderedKeys) {
    id value = [resultRow objectForKey:columnName];
    [csvWriter writeField:value];
  }
  [csvWriter writeLine];
}
[csvWriter closeFile];
[csvWriter release];

[db close];
[db release];

"<p>I've managed to delete all entities stored using Core Data (following <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1077810/delete-reset-all-entries-in-core-data"">this answer</a>).  </p>

<p>The problem is, I've noticed the primary key is still counting upwards.  Is there a way (without manually writing a SQL query) to reset the Z_MAX value for the entity?  Screenshot below to clarify what I mean.</p>

<p>The value itself isn't an issue, but I'm just concerned that at some point in the future the maximum integer may be reached and I don't want this to happen.  My application syncs data with a web service and caches it using core data, so potentially the primary key may increase by hundreds/thousands at a time.  Deleting the entire Sqlite DB isn't an option as I need to retain some of the information for other entities.</p>

<p>I've seen the 'reset' method, but surely that will reset the entire Sqlite DB?  How can I reset the primary key for just this one set of entities?  There are no relationships to other entities with the primary key I want to reset.</p>

","115730","","<p>Besides the fact that directly/manually editing a Core Data store is a horrendously stupid idea, the correct answer is:</p>

","115730","","<p>Instead of hardcoding the replacement like that, there's a better way.</p>

<p>These entities are of the form: <code>&amp;#</code> + decimal number + <code>;</code>.  The decimal number bit is the base 10 version of that character's unicode code point.  So you could search for substrings in this format, extract the number, and convert it to a character directly.</p>

<p>Here's one way to do it, using <a href=""http://regexkit.sourceforge.net"" rel=""nofollow"">RegexKitLite</a> to find the strings:</p>

<pre><code>NSString * source = @""&amp;#38; &amp;#39; &amp;#124; &amp;#160; &amp;#8211; &amp;#8212; &amp;#8216; &amp;#8217; &amp;#8218; &amp;#8220; &amp;#8221; &amp;#8230; &amp;#8364; &amp;#8594;"";

NSString * regex = @""&amp;#(\\d+);"";
NSArray * matches = [source arrayOfCaptureComponentsMatchedByRegex:regex];

NSMutableString * decodedSource = [source mutableCopy];
for (NSArray * match in matches) {
    NSString * fullMatch = [match objectAtIndex:0];
    NSString * decimalCode = [match objectAtIndex:1];

    unichar character = (unichar)[decimalCode intValue];
    NSString * replacement = [NSString stringWithFormat:@""%C"", character];

    [decodedSource replaceOccurrencesOfString:fullMatch withString:replacement options:NSLiteralSearch range:NSMakeRange(0, [decodedSource length])];
}

NSLog(@""decoded: %@"", decodedSource);
[decodedSource release];
</code></pre>

<p>On my machine, this logs:</p>

<pre><code>decoded: &amp; ' |   – — ‘ ’ ‚ “ ” … € →
</code></pre>

<p>This isn't the most efficient method (it's worst case a <code>O(nm)</code> algorithm), but it's a start. :)</p>

<li>Don't use the <code>like</code> operator in your request predicate.  Use <code>=</code>.  That should be much faster.</li>
<li>You can specify the case insensitivity of the search via the predicate, using the <code>[c]</code> modifier.</li>
<li>It's not necessary to create and destroy an <code>NSAutoreleasePool</code> on each iteration of your loop.  In fact, it's probably not needed at all.</li>

<li>The name of the method is wrong.  Nothing about this method has to do with <em>parsing</em> JSON.  At best you're interpreting an array of dictionaries that happened to <em>originate</em> from a JSON string, but there's nothing about the nature of this code that says ""this is parsing JSON"".  </li>
<li><code>-[NSDictionary objectForKey:]</code> returns an object.  A <code>BOOL</code> is not an object, it's a primitive (like an <code>int</code> or <code>char</code>).  Appending <code>*</code> to the type does not make it an object either. :)</li>
<li>Since the method name does not begin with <code>new</code> or <code>alloc</code> and does not contain the word <code>copy</code>, you're supposed to return an autoreleased object from it.  The method in the question was returning an owned object (+1 retain count), since you invoked <code>alloc</code>, but never <code>autorelease</code>.  Using the convenience constructor <code>+array</code> fixes this.</li>
<li>In your loop, you allocated a <code>Hat</code> object, but never released it.  This is a classic memory leak.</li>

","115730","","<p>To use that <code>NSThread</code> API, you mist have an object and a selector. While a block is <em>technically</em> an object, it doesn't have any methods that you can invoke.

<li>Give the block to an <code>NSBlockOperation</code>, and hand that off to an <code>NSOperationQueue</code>.</li>
<li>Create a method on an object that takes a block parameter and simply executes it, and then pass <em>that</em> object and selector, along with the block, to the <code>NSThread</code> API. Don't forget to <code>-copy</code> the block first, or you'll probably crash. </li>

<p>Then in this line</p>

<pre><code>@synthesize serverDateTimeDelegate;
</code></pre>

<p>in ApplicationDelegate.m I am getting the error ""Passing argument 4 of 'obj_setProperty' from incompatible pointer type"". I did a bit of research and found that 'retain' only works on class types, which is fair enough. If I actually remove the 'retain' from the line</p>

<pre><code>@property (nonatomic, retain) id&lt;ServerDateTimeUpdating&gt; *serverDateTimeDelegate;
</code></pre>

<p>it does compile without complaints. However, I think, that's the wrong thing to do. Surely my 'id' <em>is</em> a class type and surely it <em>should</em> be retained in the setter. BTW, here is the declaration of my HeaderPanelViewController which implements the aforementioned protocol:</p>

<pre><code> @interface HeaderPanelViewController : UIViewController&lt;ServerDateTimeUpdating&gt; {

 }

...
@end
</code></pre>

<p>Also, if I actually <em>do</em> remove the retain I get a problem later down the track when I actually call the setter to register my HeaderPanelViewController as the delegate:</p>

<pre><code>// Register this instance as the delegate for ServerDateTimeUpdating
// Retrieve the ApplicationDelegate...
ApplicationDelegate *applicationDelegate = (ApplicationDelegate *) [UIApplication sharedApplication].delegate;
// ...and register this instance
applicationDelegate.serverDateTimeDelegate = self;
</code></pre>

<p>The last line causes the XCode error message ""Passing argument 1 of 'setServerDateTimeDelegate' from incompatible pointer type"".</p>
","115730","","<p>Your problem is the property declaration:</p>

<pre><code>@property (nonatomic, retain) id&lt;ServerDateTimeUpdating&gt; *serverDateTimeDelegate;
</code></pre>

<p>If you command-double click ""id"", you'll see it defined as:</p>

<pre><code>typedef struct objc_object {
  Class isa;
} *id;
</code></pre>

<p>In other words, <code>id</code> is <em>already</em> an object reference.  Therefore, the <code>*</code> right before <code>serverDateTimeDelegate</code> is unnecessary and wrong.  Having it there means a pointer to an object reference, when you really just want an object reference.</p>
"
"<p>I'm an experienced C/C++ programmer starting to learn Objective-C development. I'm currently looking through the UICatalog sample and came across another instance of an idiom I've seen several places and never understood. </p>

<p>Code:</p>

<pre><code>ButtonsViewController *buttonsViewController = [[ButtonsViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@""ButtonsViewController"" bundle:nil];
[self.menuList addObject:[NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:
                                       NSLocalizedString(@""ButtonsTitle"", @""""), kTitleKey,
                                       NSLocalizedString(@""ButtonsExplain"", @""""), kExplainKey, 
                                       buttonsViewController, kViewControllerKey, nil]];
[buttonsViewController release];
</code></pre>

<p>AFAIK, this allocates and initializes a ButtonsViewController, creates an NSDictionary for the ButtonsViewController and adds the dictionary to an NSMutableArray called menuList (which is a member variable of the MainViewController where the above code lives) and then releases the buttonsViewController that it just created. Later, the MainViewController uses the dictionary entry to switch views to the buttonsViewController when necessary.</p>

<p>My question is: why is the buttonsViewController still valid after this code? It was allocated and released with no 'retains' between. Does adding something to an NSDictionary or NSMutableArray have an implicit 'retain'? If so, was I supposed to be able to figure that out somehow, or is it just one of those things you have to read and remember?</p>
","115730","","<p>It is standard procedure in the Cocoa frameworks for collections to retain the objects they contain. So yes, the mutable array is retaining the view controller. </p>

<p>This is always the case, unless the documentation says otherwise. </p>

"<p>I would like to add functions by creating a category for Objective-C Blocks.</p>

    if( n &lt;= 1 ) return n;
    return aBlock( n - 1 ) + aBlock( n - 2 );
};
</code></pre>

<p>Instead of just allowing the normal <code>[aBlock copy]</code>, <code>[aBlock retain]</code>, <code>[aBlock release]</code>, <code>[aBlock autorelease]</code>. I could do thing like:</p>

<pre><code>[aBlock mapTo:anArray];
</code></pre>

<p>Possible Category</p>

<pre><code>@interface UnknownBlockClass (map)

","115730","","<p>@pwc is correct in that you can't create a category for a class that you can't see.</p>

<p>However...</p>

<h1>WHAT I AM ABOUT TO TELL YOU SHOULD BE USED STRICTLY AS AN EXERCISE IN LEARNING, AND <em>NEVER</em> IN ANY SORT OF PRODUCTION SETTING.</h1>

<ol>
<li>Some runtime introspection reveals some interesting information.  There are a number of classes that contain the word ""Block"".  Some of them look promising: <code>__NSStackBlock</code>, <code>__NSMallocBlock</code>, <code>__NSAutoBlock</code>, and <code>NSBlock</code>.</li>
<li>Some more introspection shows that the promising classes inherit from <code>NSBlock</code></li>
</ol>

<p>So it looks like any block is going to be some instance or subclass of <code>NSBlock</code>.</p>

<p>You can create a method on an object, like so:</p>

<pre><code>@implementation Foo
- (void) doFoo {
  //do something awesome with self, a block
  //however, you can't do ""self()"".  
  //You'll have to cast it to a block-type variable and use that
}
@end
</code></pre>

<p>Then at runtime, you can move that method to the <code>NSBlock</code> class:</p>

<pre><code>Method m = class_getInstanceMethod([Foo class], @selector(doFoo));
IMP doFoo = method_getImplementation(m);
const char *type = method_getTypeEncoding(m);
Class nsblock = NSClassFromString(@""NSBlock"");
class_addMethod(nsblock, @selector(doFoo), doFoo, type);
</code></pre>

<p>After this, blocks should respond to the <code>doFoo</code> message.</p>

"<p><strong><em>The original question...............................................</em></strong></p>

<p>If you are an advanced user of drawRect, you will know that of course drawRect will not actually run until ""all processing is finished.""</p>

<p>setNeedsDisplay flags a view as invalidated and the OS, and basically waits until all processing is done. This can be infuriating in the common situation where you want to have:</p>

<ul>
<li>a view controller 1</li>
<li>starts some function 2</li>
<li>which incrementally 3
<ul>
<li>creates a more and more complicated artwork and 4</li>
<li>at each step, you setNeedsDisplay (wrong!) 5</li>
</ul></li>
<li>until all the work is done 6</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, when you do the above 1-6, all that happens is that drawRect is run <strong><em>once only</em></strong> after step 6.</p>

<p>Your goal is for the view to be refreshed at point 5. What to do?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong><em>Solution to the original question..............................................</em></strong></p>

<p>In a word, you can <strong><em>(A) background</em></strong> the large painting, and call to the foreground for UI updates or <strong><em>(B) arguably controversially</em></strong> there are four 'immediate' methods suggested that do not use a background process. For the result of what works, run the demo program.  It has #defines for all five methods.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong><em>Truly astounding alternate solution introduced by Tom Swift..................</em></strong></p>

<p>Tom Swift has explained the amazing idea of quite simply <strong>manipulating the run loop</strong>. Here's how you trigger the run loop:</p>

<p>[[NSRunLoop currentRunLoop] runMode: NSDefaultRunLoopMode beforeDate: [NSDate date]];</p>

<p>This is a truly amazing piece of engineering. Of course one should be extremely careful when manipulating the run loop and as many pointed out this approach is strictly for experts.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong><em>The Bizarre Problem That Arises..............................................</em></strong></p>

<p>Even though a number of the methods work, they don't actually ""work"" because there is a bizarre progressive-slow-down artifact you will see clearly in the demo.</p>

<p>Scroll to the 'answer' I pasted in below, showing the console output - you can see how it progressively slows.</p>

<p>Here's the new SO question:<br>
<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4786754"">Mysterious &quot;progressive slowing&quot; problem in run loop / drawRect</a></p>

<p>Here is V2 of the demo app...<br>
<a href=""http://www.fileswap.com/dl/p8lU3gAi/stepwiseDrawingV2.zip.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fileswap.com/dl/p8lU3gAi/stepwiseDrawingV2.zip.html</a></p>

<p>You will see it tests all five methods,</p>

<pre><code>#ifdef TOMSWIFTMETHOD
 [self setNeedsDisplay];
 [[NSRunLoop currentRunLoop]
      runMode:NSDefaultRunLoopMode beforeDate:[NSDate date]];
#endif
#ifdef HOTPAW
 [self setNeedsDisplay];
 [CATransaction flush];
#endif
#ifdef LLOYDMETHOD
 [CATransaction begin];
 [self setNeedsDisplay];
 [CATransaction commit];
#endif
#ifdef DDLONG
 [self setNeedsDisplay];
 [[self layer] displayIfNeeded];
#endif
#ifdef BACKGROUNDMETHOD
 // here, the painting is being done in the bg, we have been
 // called here in the foreground to inval
 [self setNeedsDisplay];
#endif
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><p>You can see for yourself which methods work and which do not.</p></li>
<li><p>you can see the bizarre ""progressive-slow-down"". why does it happen?</p></li>
<li><p>you can see with the controversial TOMSWIFT method, there is actually no problem at all with responsiveness. tap for response at any time. (but still the bizarre ""progressive-slow-down"" problem)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So the overwhelming thing is this weird  ""progressive-slow-down"": on each iteration, for unknown reasons, the time taken for a loop deceases.  Note that this applies to both doing it ""properly"" (background look) or using one of the 'immediate' methods.  </p>

<hr>

<p><strong><em>Practical solutions ........................</em></strong></p>

<p>For anyone reading in the future, if you are actually unable to get this to work in production code because of the ""mystery progressive slowdown"" ... Felz and Void have each presented astounding solutions in the other specific question, hope it helps.</p>
","115730","","<p>Without questioning the wisdom of this (which you ought to do), you can do:</p>

<pre><code>[myView setNeedsDisplay];
[[myView layer] displayIfNeeded];
</code></pre>

<p><code>-setNeedsDisplay</code> will mark the view as needing to be redrawn.
<code>-displayIfNeeded</code> will force the view's backing layer to redraw, but only if it has been marked as needing to be displayed.</p>

<p>I will emphasize, however, that your question is indicative of an architecture that could use some re-working.  In all but exceptionally rare cases, you should <strong>never need to or want to force a view to redraw immediately</strong>.  UIKit with not built with that use-case in mind, and if it works, consider yourself lucky.</p>

"<p>I'm trying to figure out if it's possible to use different row templates for specific rows in an NSPredicateEditor (or, if need be, an NSRuleEditor). I've got a screenshot that I think helps me explain this more clearly.
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/8sAo8.png"" alt=""NSPredicateEditor example screenshot""></p>

<p>In this contrived example, I only want people to generate a filter that looks for a specific path above a certain size. So, in Section A (the Any block), users can only specify path rules (and the users can add additional paths). In section B, I only want the Size option to be available.</p>

<p>Nothing's jumping out at me from the docs (or, the stuff that does jump out at me ends up being something else), but it seems like this is the sort of thing that might come in handy, which makes me think it might be possible.</p>
","115730","","<p>From what I understand about <code>NSPredicateEditor</code>, this is not possible.  You might be able to swing it if you do everything yourself with an <code>NSRuleEditor</code>, but I haven't played with that class as much.</p>

<p>So in a nutshell: if you implement it yourself, it's possible.  With the built-in stuff, I'm 99.9% certain that it's not a configurable behavior.</p>

"<p>I'm nesting blocks, and it looks UGGGGLY. Is there a way to write this less ugly? Mostly looking for syntax suggestions, rather than structural, but I'll accept either.</p>

<p>My block factory method,</p>

<pre><code>-(NSImage *(^)(CGFloat size, BOOL preview))resizeBlock {

return (NSImage *(^)(CGFloat size, BOOL preview))[[^(CGFloat size, BOOL preview){
        // image-resizing code
        return [[[NSImage alloc] init] autorelease];
    } copy] autorelease];

}
</code></pre>

<p>Which is called from a number of functions similar to this,</p>

<pre><code>-(void)queueResize:(CGFloat)targetSize toView:(NSImageView *)targetView {
    NSImage*(^sizeBlock)(CGFloat,BOOL) = [self resizeBlock];
    NSBlockOperation *bo = [NSBlockOperation blockOperationWithBlock:^(void) {
        NSImage *previewImage = (NSImage*)sizeBlock(targetSize,YES);
        targetView.image = previewImage;
    }];
    [queue addOperation:bo];
}
</code></pre>

<p>queue is an NSOperationQueue object. It won't compile without all the (ugly ugly) casting. Amidoinitrite?</p>

<p>Edit:
As per Dave DeLong's answer, and <a href=""http://www.cimgf.com/2008/02/16/cocoa-tutorial-nsoperation-and-nsoperationqueue/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cimgf.com/2008/02/16/cocoa-tutorial-nsoperation-and-nsoperationqueue/</a>, I changed the line</p>

<pre><code>targetView.image = previewImage;
</code></pre>

<p>to be,</p>

<pre><code>[targetView performSelectorOnMainThread:@selector(setImage:) withObject:previewImage waitUntilDone:YES];
</code></pre>
","115730","","<p>Use <code>typedef</code>:</p>

<pre><code>typedef NSImage *(^KWResizerBlock)(CGFloat size, BOOL preview);
</code></pre>

<p>This makes your code become:</p>

<pre><code>- (KWResizerBlock) resizeBlock {
  KWResizerBlock block = ^(CGFloat size, BOOL preview){
    // image-resizing code
    return [[[NSImage alloc] init] autorelease];
  };
  return [[block copy] autorelease];
}

-(void)queueResize:(CGFloat)targetSize toView:(NSImageView *)targetView {
  KWResizerBlock sizeBlock = [self resizeBlock];
  NSBlockOperation *bo = [NSBlockOperation blockOperationWithBlock:^{
    NSImage *previewImage = sizeBlock(targetSize, YES);
    //do something with previewImage
  }];
  [queue addOperation:bo];
}
</code></pre>

<p>One word of caution:</p>

<p>Your <code>NSBlockOperation</code> is going to be executing on a thread that's not the main thread, and so it is unsafe to manipulate any UI element from within that context.  If you need to put the <code>previewImage</code> onto the UI, then you should <code>dispatch_async()</code> back to the main thread (or something functionally equivalent).</p>

<p>It may work right now, but it is <strong>strongly</strong> discourage and can lead to undefined behavior.</p>

<p>Having written lots of time code in python, I know that getting it right is hard, so I'd like to avoid writing recurrence logic myself, so if anyone can recommend a library that might do what I want that can be used in an iOS application, that'd be much appreciated.</p>

"<p>It is hard to put this problem into words, but a real world example will help. If you look at the iTunes app, it appears to have a <code>NSSplitView</code> for the <code>Sidebar | Content</code> split, and a nested <code>NSSplitView</code> for the source list and artwork panel.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/XzGID.png"" alt=""enter image description here"">  ======>  <img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/a3Lki.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>When you drag the divider to make the sidebar thinner, the artwork view (the bottom half of the inner <code>NSSplitView</code>) shortens to maintain the right aspect ratio.  This is the behavior I am after.</p>

<p>I have hooked up the outer <code>NSSplitView</code>'s <code>delegate</code> to point to the sideBarController so I can get the sizing changes and resize the lower portion of the split view programatically. <strong>I have this half of the problem working correctly,</strong> that is, when I change the sidebars, width, the sidebar panels adjust their size accordingly.</p>

<p>The problem I am having issues in attacking is how to resize the sidebar width when the nested <code>NSSplitView</code>'s height is altered. I originally tried to find ways to make this inner splitview's divider non-draggable, but could not find any way to do that. The way I have it setup now is to set the inner scrollview's delegate to be the windowController that owns the main splitview, then do a calculation on the height to alter the width of the info panel.</p>

<p>Of course, altering ones size causes the other splitview to alter its size, which aters the originals size again and a endless loop is created. I could add flags and timers to try and work this out, but already it seems like I am going agains the grain here to achieve this functionality.</p>

<p>How can I properly constrain the nested splitview panel to its parents width or more generally, <strong>What is the best way to duplicate the resizing behaviors of the iTunes ""Selected Item / Now Playing"" view?</strong></p>
","115730","","<p>You might try taking a look at my <a href=""http://github.com/davedelong/CHLayoutManager"" rel=""nofollow"">CHLayoutManager</a>, which would allow you to do:</p>

CHLayoutConstraint *constraint = [CHLayoutConstraint constraintWithAttribute: CHLayoutConstraintAttributeHeight relativeTo:@""splitview"" attribute: CHLayoutConstraintAttributeWidth];
[mySplitView addConstraint:constraint];
</code></pre>

<p>Now whenever your <code>mySplitView</code> resizes, it will automatically update the height of the view to match the width.</p>

<p>Typed in a browser.  Caveat Implementor.  Bonus points for using <code>NSDecimal</code> instead of a <code>double</code>.</p>

<p>Explanation of what's going on:</p>

<p>We're essentially doing bit shifting, but in base 10 instead of base 2.  When the user types a number (ex: 6), we ""shift"" the existing number left one decimal place (ex: 0.000 => 00.00), multiply the typed number by 0.01 (6 => 0.06), and add that to our existing number (00.00 => 00.06).  When the user types in another number (ex: 1), we do the same thing.  Shift left (00.06 => 00.60), multiply the typed number by 0.01 (1 => 0.01), and add (00.60 => 00.61).  The purpose of storing the number is an <code>NSMutableArray</code> is simply a convenience to make deletion easier.  It's not necessary, however.  Just a convenience.</p>

<p>When the user hits the delete button (if there is one), we take the last number entered (ex: 1), multiply it be 0.01 (1 => 0.01), subtract it from our number (0.61 => 0.6), and then shift our number right one decimal place (0.6 => 0.06).  Repeat this as long as you've got numbers in your array of entered numbers.  Disable the delete button when that array is empty.</p>

<p>The suggestion to use <code>NSDecimal</code> is simply to allow for very high precision numbers.</p>

","115730","","<p>You could fetch all your Towns before handling the JSON payload.  Then as you do whatever you do with the JSON, remove the corresponding Town from your array of towns.

","115730","","<p>It's possible, but in a roundabout way.  I recommend that you consider using a different approach.</p>

<p>That being said, here's how you'd do it:</p>

<pre><code>NSDictionary *d = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:
                   [NSArray arrayWithObjects:@""a"", @""b"", @""c"", nil], @""a"",
                   [NSArray arrayWithObjects:@""b"", @""c"", @""a"", nil], @""b"",
                   [NSArray arrayWithObjects:@""c"", @""a"", @""b"", nil], @""c"",
                   [NSArray arrayWithObjects:@""a"", @""b"", @""c"", nil], @""d"",
                   nil];

NSLog(@""%@"", p);
NSArray *keys = [d allKeys];
NSArray *filteredKeys = [keys filteredArrayUsingPredicate:p];
NSLog(@""%@"", filteredKeys);
NSDictionary *matchingDictionary = [d dictionaryWithValuesForKeys:filteredKeys];
NSLog(@""%@"", matchingDictionary);
</code></pre>

<p>Here's what's going on:</p>

<p>We've got our source dictionary, <code>d</code>.  This is a dictionary where a letter (<code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>c</code>, or <code>d</code>) is keyed to an array.  We're going to find all the <em>keys</em> that correspond to an array where the first element is <code>a</code>.</p>

<p>Our predicate is:</p>

<pre><code>[NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@""%@[SELF][0] == 'a'"", d];
</code></pre>

<p>Here we're using the indexing operator on our source dictionary.  <code>SELF</code>, when this predicate is evaluated, will be one of the <em>keys</em> of <code>d</code>.  So <code>%@[SELF]</code> will return an array.  We then take the 0th element of that array and compare it to the string <code>a</code>.  If it matches, then this returns <code>YES</code>.</p>

<p>We then grab all the keys in the dictionary and filter them using this predicate.  This means that the resulting array will contain only the keys where the first element of the corresponding array is <code>a</code>.</p>

<p>Once we have the matching keys, we extract a ""sub dictionary"" from our source dictionary to get our final, reduced dictionary.</p>

<p>In the test above, <code>matchingDictionary</code> has two keys (<code>a</code> and <code>d</code>), which are both keyed to an array containing <code>(a, b, c)</code>.</p>

<p>If you want an <code>NSArray</code> instead that contains the matching arrays, you'd use <code>-[NSDictionary objectsForKeys:notFoundMarker:]</code> instead.</p>

<p>However, this is an awkward solution, and I still think you should reorganize your data.</p>

"<p>Basically I'm attempting a put your finger on the globe and spin it type function.</p>

<p>So all I really need to do is grab the direction of the swipe and velocity with a short timer (?500ms?)</p>

<p>So something like </p>

<pre><code>While(swiping) {
   Get(pointTouched);
   swipeDirection = Calc(direction);
   swipeSpeed = Calc(speed);

   FramesToPlay = swipeSpeed * ConstantAmount;

   If(Direction == Backwards){
      FramesToPlay = FramesToPlay * -1;
   }

   Play(playAnimation, FramesToPlay);

   wait(500ms);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Anyone know anything like this? Or any pieces I can cobble together?</p>

<p>I have the Animation figured out it's just the details on this swiping that have me a touch confused.</p>
","115730","","<p>Here's how I would do it:  Create a subclass of <code>UISwipeGestureRecognizer</code>.  The purpose of this subclass would simply be to remember the very first and last <code>UITouch</code> objects that it receives in its <code>touchesBegan:withEvent:</code> method.  Everything else would be forwarded on to <code>super</code>.</p>

<p>When your recognizer triggers its action, the recognizer will be passed in as the <code>sender</code> parameter.  You can ask it for the initial and final touch objects, then use the <code>locationInView:</code> method and the <code>timestamp</code> property to figure out the velocity of the swipe (velocity = change in distance / change in time).</p>

<p>So it'd be something like this:</p>

<pre><code>@interface DDSwipeGestureRecognizer : UISwipeGestureRecognizer 

@property (nonatomic, retain) UITouch * firstTouch;
@property (nonatomic, retain) UITouch * lastTouch;

@end

@implementation DDSwipeGestureRecognizer
@synthesize firstTouch, lastTouch;

- (void) dealloc {
  [firstTouch release];
  [lastTouch release];
  [super dealloc];
}

- (void) touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event {
  [self setFirstTouch:[touches anyObject]];
  [super touchesBegan:touches withEvent:event];
}

- (void) touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event {
  [self setLastTouch:[touches anyObject]];
  [super touchesEnded:touches withEvent:event];
}

@end
</code></pre>

<p>Then elsewhere you'd do:</p>

<pre><code>DDSwipeGestureRecognizer *swipe = [[DDSwipeGestureRecognizer alloc] init];
[swipe setTarget:self];
[swipe setAction:@selector(swiped:)];
[myView addGestureRecognizer:swipe];
[swipe release];
</code></pre>

<p>And your action would be something like:</p>

<pre><code>- (void) swiped:(DDSwipeGestureRecognizer *)recognizer {
  CGPoint firstPoint = [[recognizer firstTouch] locationInView:myView];
  CGPoint lastPoint = [[recognizer lastTouch] locationInView:myView];
  CGFloat distance = ...; // the distance between firstPoint and lastPoint
  NSTimeInterval elapsedTime = [[recognizer lastTouch] timestamp] - [[recognizer firstTouch] timestamp];
  CGFloat velocity = distance / elapsedTime;

  NSLog(@""the velocity of the swipe was %f points per second"", velocity);
}

","115730","","<p>You don't want to get <em>rid</em> of this error, you want to <em>fix</em> it.</p>

<p>The problem here is that you're linking a <strong>simulator</strong> version of your library into the <strong>device</strong> build of your app.  The simulator wants libraries in the i386 architecture, and the device wants things in the armv6 or armv7 architecture.</p>

<p>So the solution here is to link the correct version of your library.</p>

<p>What I usually do is combine them into a single library and let the linker pick the right version for me.  Here's what you do in Terminal:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd /path/to/my/libraries
$ ls 
  libMyLibrary-Device.a
  libMyLibrary-Simulator.a
$ file libMyLibrary-Device.a
  libMyLibrary-Device.a: Mach-O universal binary with 2 architectures
  libMyLibrary-Device.a (for architecture armv6):   current ar archive random library
  libMyLibrary-Device.a (for architecture armv7):   current ar archive random library
$ file libMyLibrary-Simulator.a
  libMyLibrary-Simulator.a: Mach-O universal binary with 1 architecture
  libMyLibrary-Simulator.a (for architecture i386): current ar archive random library
$ lipo -create -output libMyLibrary.a libMyLibrary-Device.a libMyLibrary-Simulator.a
$ ls
  libMyLibrary-Device.a

  libMyLibrary.a (for architecture armv7):  current ar archive random library
  libMyLibrary.a (for architecture i386):   current ar archive random library
</code></pre>

<p>Does anyone have an idea how should this be implemented?</p>
","115730","","<p><strong>edit</strong> back on a regular computer...</p>

<p>So there are a couple things to be aware of:</p>

<ol>
<li>You don't need to put quotes around the substitution placeholder in your format string.  When the method is building the predicate, it's going to be creating an abstract syntax tree of <code>NSExpression</code> and <code>NSPredicate</code> (specifically <code>NSComparisonPredicate</code> and <code>NSCompoundPredicate</code>) objects.  Your string will be placed into an <code>NSExpression</code> of type <code>NSConstantValueExpressionType</code>, meaning that it's <em>already</em> going to be interpreted as a regular string.  Placing the single quotes in the format string will, in fact, make your predicate non-functional.</li>
<li>You're not limited to a single comparison in a predicate.  From the sounds of it, you want to have as many comparisons as you have ""words"" in your search string (<code>nameVar</code>).  In that case, we'll break the <code>nameVar</code> up into its constituent words, and create a comparison for each word.  Once we've done that, we <code>AND</code> them together to create a single overarching predicate.  The code below does exactly that.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>original answer</strong></p>

<p>You can do this by building your own <code>NSCompoundPredicate</code>:</p>

<pre><code>NSString *nameVar = ...; //ex: smith m
NSArray *names = ...; //ex: John Smith, Mary Smith

NSArray *terms = [nameVar componentsSeparatedByCharactersInSet:[NSCharacterSet whitespaceCharacterSet]];
NSMutableArray *subpredicates = [NSMutableArray array];

for(NSString *term in terms) {
  if([term length] == 0) { continue; }
  NSPredicate *p = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@""name contains[cd] %@"", term];
  [subpredicates addObject:p];
}

NSPredicate *filter = [NSCompoundPredicate andPredicateWithSubpredicates:subpredicates];
[fetchController setPredicate:filter];

"<p>I am just curious with regards to the following, when I am writing code I always try and manage the memory myself by sticking to non-autoreleased objects. I know that this means that objects are not hanging around in the pool, but I was just curious if doing it this way in general is good practice or simply overkill?</p>

</code></pre>
","115730","","<p>Total overkill.  If you read the relevant documentation carefully, it does not say that you should avoid autoreleasing objects.  It says that you should avoid using autorelease pools when you in tight, object-rich loops.  In those cases, you should be managing your memory explicitly (with <code>retain</code> and <code>release</code>) to ensure that objects are created and destroyed in an amortized manner.</p>

<p>The argument that the iPhone is a memory-constrained environment is true, but a <em>complete</em> red herring.  Objective-C, with the Foundation and Cocoa frameworks (though they weren't called that at the time), ran <em>just fine</em> on a NeXTcube, which had 16MB of RAM (expandable to 64).  Even the iPhone 3, which is pretty much EOL at this point, has 128MB.</p>

<p><strong>edit</strong></p>

<p>Since an iPhone app is a runloop-based application, a new autorelease pool is going to be created and destroyed every time it spins.  This is clearly defined in the documentation.  As such, the only reasons you'd have to create your own autorelease pool are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Spawning a background thread, where you <em>must</em> create your own pool (since new threads, by default, do not have a base ARPool)</li>
<li>Performing some operation that will generate a significant number of autoreleased objects.  In this case, creating and draining a pool would be to help ensure the limited lifetime of the temporary objects.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, in the second case, you're recommended to explicitly manage memory as much as possible.  This is so that your operation doesn't come to a screeching halt when it attempts to drain a pool with a few thousand objects in it.  If you manage your memory manually, you can release these objects gradually as they are no longer needed, instead of saving them up for a single all-at-once release.  You could help amortize the all-at-once release by nesting ARPools, which will help.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, though, just do what feels natural, and then (and <em>only</em> then) optimize it if you have concrete evidence that you need to do so.</p>

<p><strong>edit #2</strong></p>

<p>OK, it turns out that there <em>is</em> a <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/iphone/conceptual/iphoneosprogrammingguide/Performance/Performance.html"">recommendation to avoid using <code>autorelease</code></a>.  <strong>BUT</strong> that recommendation is in the ""Allocate Memory Wisely"" section of the ""Tuning for Performance and Responsiveness"" area of the iOS Application Programming Guide.  In other words, avoid it <em>if you're measuring a performance problem</em>.  But seriously: autorelease has been around for ~20 years and did just fine on computers far slower and more constrained than the iDevices of today.</p>

"<p>I have a SQLite-backed core data storage and would like to fetch a list of managed objects using <code>NSFetchRequest</code>.

<pre><code>[NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@""uid = %@"", currentUID]

","115730","","<p>What you're asking for doesn't make sense.</p>

<p>A predicate is used to select which objects should be returned in a set of results.  This is determined by evaluating the predicate against each object to see if the predicate evaluates to <code>YES</code> or <code>NO</code> (a binary value, or one of 2 possible values).  If it evaluates to <code>YES</code>, then the object is included.  If it evaluates to <code>NO</code>, then the object is excluded.  There is no middle ground.</p>

<p>By contrast, a sort descriptor evaluates to <code>less than</code>, <code>equal</code>, or <code>greater than</code>.  In other words, it is a <em>ternary</em> value (it can be one of <em>3</em> things).  There is no way to express a ternary value with a predicate (since a predicate is binary), and so using a predicate as a sort descriptor makes absolutely no sense.  The API doesn't allow it, because <em>logic</em> doesn't allow it.</p>

<p>So the real question is:  what are you trying to do?  Why do you think you need a predicate in your sort descriptors?</p>

It shows the olympic logo, and makes the rings fly around to a random location on the screen, then animate back to their original position.  You could <em>probably</em> do something very similar, but obviously not using the <code>position</code> property.</p>

<p>Here's the basic code to make one of the rings fly around:</p>

<pre><code>CABasicAnimation * a = [CABasicAnimation animationWithKeyPath:@""position""];
[a setTimingFunction:[CAMediaTimingFunction functionWithName:kCAMediaTimingFunctionEaseInEaseOut]];
[a setFromValue:[NSValue valueWithCGPoint:[layer position]]];
[a setToValue:[NSValue valueWithCGPoint:[self randomPoint]]];
[a setAutoreverses:YES];
[a setDuration:1.0];
[layer addAnimation:a forKey:nil];
</code></pre>

<p>Your <code>fromValue</code> and <code>toValue</code> values would be <code>CGColorRefs</code>, and your animation keypath would be different, but the trick here is the <code>setAutoreverses:YES</code>.  This will animate from the <code>fromValue</code> to the <code>toValue</code>, and then back to the <code>fromValue</code>.  It's pretty darn handy. :)</p>

<hr>

<p>If that doesn't work (and it might not), then I might just layer two <code>UILabels</code> on top of each other and animate their alpha values from 0.0 to 1.0 (or vice versa) at the same time.</p>

"<p>Using <code>InstallApplicationEventHandler</code> and <code>RegisterEventHotKey</code> from Carbon framework, I'm able to catch whatever key I want.</p>

<p>On the contrary I can't find a way to handle correctly the event when a key is held down (kept pressed). I mean, when I held down a key, <code>RegisterEventHotKey</code> responds like if I have pressed and then released the key; I want it, instead, to send the ""event"" continuously until the key is released.</p>

<p>What I really want to achieve, to be precise, when a key is kept pressed is this:</p>

<p>as soon as the key is pressed and held down I want that <code>InstallApplicationEventHandler</code> and <code>RegisterEventHotKey</code> create an event but not only once (as I have now) but every x milliseconds or so until the key is released.</p>

<p>The particular keys that I'm considering are <strong>not</strong> modifier keys.</p>

<p>Can you help me? I'm really becoming crazy on this!</p>
","115730","","<p>Maybe start firing a timer every 0.25 seconds or something that checks to see if the appropriate keys are still down.  If they are, re-invoke the action.  Otherwise, invalidate the timer.</p>

"<p>For various implementation reasons, I've defined the following enum:</p>

<pre><code>typedef enum HBSnakeMovementDirection
{
    HBSnakeMovementDirectionUp = 1,
    HBSnakeMovementDirectionDown = -1,
    HBSnakeMovementDirectionRight = 2,
    HBSnakeMovementDirectionLeft = -2
}
HBSnakeMovementDirection;
</code></pre>

<p>However, if I try to use <code>HBSnakeMovementDirectionRight</code>, I get the following warning:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>Implicit conversion changes signedness: 'int' to 'HBSnakeMovementDirection'</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It has no problem with any of the other enum values. What's the problem here? I thought it might have to do with mixing negative and positive enum values, but I can't find out anything definitive about this.</p>

<p>(I was able to come up with all positive enum values that allow me to work around this issue, but it still stumped me, so I thought I'd ask about it.)</p>

<p>I should state that, as with all my projects, I enable almost every warning—hence, <code>-Wconversion</code>'s complaints—and treat them as errors. (I like to be as strict as possible at compile time.) I'm using LLVM 1.6.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 1</strong>: Literally any use of <code>HBSnakeMovementDirectionRight</code> results in the preceding warning:</p>

<pre><code>HBSnakeMovementDirection movementDirectionRight = HBSnakeMovementDirectionRight;

<p>I have to cast <code>HBSnakeMovementDirectionRight</code> to <code>HBSnakeMovementDirection</code> to silence the warning.</p>

"<p>Hey guys &amp; girls,
Im wondering how I can find the object count of a specific type of object in an array.
For example, i have 6 'clouds' in NSMutableArray at random locations, I also have 4 'dragons' in this NSMutableArray.</p>

<p>How can i gather the integer 6?</p>

<p>I was thinking something along the lines of:</p>

<pre><code>int z = [[SomeClass *clouds in _somearray] count];
</code></pre>

<p>Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.
Thnx,
Oliver.</p>
","115730","","<p>If you're looking for how many times a specific <em>instance</em> of an object appears, you can do:</p>

<pre><code>NSCountedSet *counts = [NSCountedSet setWithArray:myArrayOfObjects];
NSUInteger count = [counts countForObject:myObject];
</code></pre>

<p>Otherwise you'd just have to loop through the array manually and count.</p>

"<p>I am making a little program that will put some events in a calendar on the iPhone. In the settings I will let the user select wich calendar to use. To present what calendars he can use I pull all calendars from the EKEventStore and sort out those that doesn't allow modifications. Those are subscribed from other websites.</p>

<p>Mike.</p>
","115730","","<p>Your code is wrong, in that (it appears that) you've misunderstood how method names work in Objective-C.</p>

<p>For example, as your method currently stands, it is named:</p>

<pre><code>switchViews:::
</code></pre>

<p>That's probably not what you're looking for.</p>

<p>A better name might be:</p>

<pre><code>replaceView:forProperty:withViewOfClass:
</code></pre>

<p>Declared, that would look like:</p>

<pre><code>- (void) replaceView:(UIView *)outView forProperty:(NSString *)propertyName withViewOfClass:(Class)inClass;
</code></pre>

<p>And you would use it like this:</p>

<pre><code>Class viewOptions = ...;
NSString *viewMainMenu = @""..."";
[burgerViewController replaceView:viewMainMenu forProperty:viewMainMenu withViewOfClass:viewOptions];

<p>So I stripped out all the table methods and misc crap that doesnt matter. In the end my problem is adding the ""tempProduct"" object to the mutable array dataArray so that I can customize the table cells.
   Using the json framework im parsing out some json which returns an array of NSDictionary objects. Stepping through that my dictionary objects look good, I populate my custom object with properties for all my fields which goes through fine, and the values look right. However I cant add this to the array, I've tried several different implementations doesn't work. Not sure what I'm doing wrong. In some instances doing a po tempProduct prints the description and sometimes it does not. same with right clicking on the variable and choosing print description.</p>

","115730","","<p>Your problem is this:</p>

<pre><code>self.dataArray = [[NSArray alloc] initWithObjects:nil];
</code></pre>

<p>There are a couple things wrong here:</p>

<ol>
<li>This is a memory leak.  The property is declared as a <code>retain</code> property, and you're giving it an owned object.  Therefore you've declared ownership of the object <em>twice</em> (once with <code>+alloc</code>, then again by <code>retaining</code> it in the property setter method), but you only relinquish ownership once (when the object is deallocated).</li>
<li>You're not giving <code>self</code> a mutable array.  You're giving it an <em>immutable</em> array.  In other words, <code>NSArray != NSMutableArray</code>.  Once you've created an <code>NSArray</code>, you cannot change its contents.  You can only do that with an <code>NSMutableArray</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>To fix this, you should change the line to:</p>

<pre><code>self.dataArray = [NSMutableArray array];
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Beyond this, you have memory leaks all over the place.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>For example, pretty much every single line in your <code>-[Product initWithDict:]</code> method is leaking memory.  They should all be replaced with:</p>

<pre><code>self.propertyName = [dic objectForKey:@""dictionary key""];
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>This is flat-out wrong:</p>

<pre><code>[self.dataArray release];
</code></pre>

<p>You should do:</p>

<pre><code>self.dataArray = nil;
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>This is another leak:</p>

<pre><code>NSString *thisString = [[NSString alloc] initWithString:@""""];
thisString = [NSString stringWithFormat:@""http://api.curthitch.biz/AJAX_CURT.aspx?action=GetHitch&amp;dataType=json&amp;year=%@&amp;make=%@&amp;model=%@&amp;style=%@"",year,make,model,style];
</code></pre>

<p>You should do:</p>

<pre><code>NSString *thisString = [NSString stringWithFormat:@""http://api.curthitch.biz/AJAX_CURT.aspx?action=GetHitch&amp;dataType=json&amp;year=%@&amp;make=%@&amp;model=%@&amp;style=%@"",year,make,model,style];
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>you <code>+alloc</code> a string referenced by <code>json_string</code>, but you never <code>release</code> it.</p></li>
<li>you <code>+alloc</code> an <code>SBJsonParser</code>, but you never <code>release</code> it.</li>
<li>you <code>+alloc</code> a <code>Product</code> on each iteration of your <code>for</code> loop, but you never <code>release</code> it.</li>

"<p>I have a dictionary of objects that need to be cleaned up before they are released.  I have a method that does this for the entire dictionary.  Before I release the dictionary in my <code>-dealloc</code> method, I want to do the same thing.  However, I am not sure of the state of the object during deallocation.  In C# or Java, for instance, I would never call a method on the object being finalized, but I am not sure this applies to Objective C and deallocation.  Is it acceptable to call the clean up method on <code>self</code> during deallocation, or should I duplicate that functionality in my <code>-dealloc</code>?</p>
","115730","","<p>Yes, you may invoke methods from inside your <code>dealloc</code> method, though you're wise to be cautious.  Pretty much the <em>only</em> methods you should invoke should be ""tear down"" methods, or methods that help in cleaning up an object before its resources are reclaimed.  Some of these cleanup methods include:</p>

<ul>
<li>unregistering for notifications via a notification center</li>
<li>removing yourself as a key-value observer</li>
<li>other general cleanup methods</li>
</ul>

<p>Note, however, that in each of these methods, your object will be in an inconsistent state.  It may be partially deallocated (some ivars may/will be invalid), and so you should <em>never</em> rely on a specific object state.  These methods should <em>only</em> be used to continue deconstructing object state.</p>

<p>This is the fundamental reason why we're discouraged from using property setters (<code>setFoo:</code> methods) in <code>dealloc</code>: another object may be registered as an observer, and using the property will trigger a KVO notification, and if the observer is expect the object to have a valid state, they could be out of luck and things can blow up very quickly.</p>

<p>TL;DR:</p>

<p>Yes, it's safe, as long as you're smart about it.</p>

"<p>While in the process of debugging code written by a co-worker, I stumbled across the following that has me mystified:</p>

<p>Why does this work? It also works for <code>NSDictionary</code> and other types, but nowhere in the documentation nor Cocoa headers can those <code>@property</code> definitions be found.</p>

<p>Googling for ""NSArray property"" doesn't yield many useful results, so I'm reaching out to SO for what will surely be a very embarrassing question.</p>
","115730","","<p>It works because dot syntax has nothing to do with properties.  It is simply syntactic sugar (though I don't like it, so perhaps it's ""syntactic salt"").</p>

<p>When you use dot syntax as the rvalue to an expression (or the expression to the right of the equal sign), it simple turns:</p>

<pre><code>bar = myObject.thing;
</code></pre>

<p>Into</p>

<pre><code>bar = [myObject thing];
</code></pre>

<p>When the dot is to the left of the equal sign (as an lvalue), it turns it into the setter.  So:</p>

<pre><code>myObject.thing = 42;
</code></pre>

<p>Becomes</p>

<pre><code>[myObject setThing:42];
</code></pre>

<p>So yes, you can do things like <code>myObject.retain</code>.  But <strong>you should never ever do that</strong>.  You should only ever use dot syntax as accessors to declared properties (ie, things that have been explicitly declared via <code>@property</code>).  <sub><em>&lt;insert remark about how you should never use dot syntax at all.&gt;</em></sub></p>

<p>filteredQuestionChoices1 contains an item with a code of ""A"". filteredQuestionChoices2 does not have that item.

<p>My Problem is:
I wanted to set a clock time for a label with a UISlider.
So basically my slider min value is 0000 and the max value is 2400. (24 hour format)
So how do I achieve a properly formatted clock?</p>

Any tipps for that :)</p>

Thanks to all who participate.</p>
","115730","","<p>You could do this with an NSDateComponents object. Create one, then break up your slider value into two parts: the thousands and hundred digits become the hour, and the tens and ones digits become the minute. You can feed this object to an NSCalendar to transform it into an actual NSDate (if that's what you want). </p>

If your app is not running at all, then I have no idea what happens when the app starts.</p>

So basically, if the user never deletes entries and if there are 50 entries in core data then, when the user tries to add a new entry, the app would delete the oldest entry and add the user's new entry. Basically, I'm trying to have a history sort of thing but I don't want the user to be able to go past 50 entries however I want them to be able to add new entries when their at the 50 limit by just dropping the oldest one and adding the newest one. What would be the easiest way to do this? I'm new to core data and having a hard time understanding a lot of it. Here's the code / example app that I'm working with. <a href=""http://www.techotopia.com/index.php/An_iPhone_OS_Core_Data_Tutorial"" rel=""nofollow"">LINK TO EXAMPLE APP THAT I'M USING</a> Thanks for the help.</p>
","115730","","<p>OK, that's fine.  CoreData is not going to do this for you, but you can do it yourself.</p>

<p>You can retrieve objects from you context using an <code>NSFetchRequest</code>, and you can delete them using <code>-[NSManagedObjectContext deleteObject:]</code>.  You can sort them using <code>NSSortDescriptor</code> objects.</p>

"<p>How would I make an <code>NSCell</code> with more than one UI element in it and display it in an <code>NSTableView</code>? For <code>NSCells</code> with a single value I could implement <code>tableView:objectValueForTableColumn:row:</code> but I don't know how to do this for <code>NSCells</code> with more than one. At the moment I have an <code>NSView</code> in an <code>NSCollectionView</code> and all the elements are bound to an <code>NSArrayController</code>. But I'd rather have an <code>NSTableView</code> or similar.</p>
","115730","","<p>You return the primary value in the <code>tableView:objectValueForTableColumn:row:</code> method, and then set up the cell further in <code>tableView:willDisplayCell:forTableColumn:row:</code>.</p>

<p>Either that, or you create a custom <code>NSCell</code> subclass that can customize itself based on the <code>objectValue</code> that you give it.</p>

","115730","","<p>Applications cannot alter core functionality of the device.  As such, you cannot interfere with the phone capabilities.  Therefore, what you are asking for is not possible.</p>

<p>I am, of course, assuming that you haven't jailbroken your phone.</p>
"
"<p>If it can, are there any gotchas to using it?</p>
","115730","","<p>Yes you can.  I just tried it.  This makes sense, since blocks are instances of <code>NSBlock</code> (a private class), which itself inherits from <code>NSObject</code>.</p>

<p>However, my naïve test seemed to indicate that the associated object was not un-associated when the block was deallocated.  (Although it's possible that I was never hitting the block's <code>-dealloc</code> method)</p>

<p>I'll keep experimenting and try some more stuff.</p>

"<p>I need to customize the default message composer as at <code>To:</code> I need to diplay the recipient number and body contains an automatic message.<br>Can it possible to send this message without user interaction as he need not to be tap on to the send button.</p>

<p>Thanks to all,
Monish.</p>
","115730","","<p>The <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/MessageUI/Reference/MFMessageComposeViewController_class/Reference/Reference.html"" rel=""nofollow"">documentation for <code>MFMessageComposeViewController</code></a> shows that you can programmatically set the <code>body</code> and the <code>recipients</code> of a text message.  It does not, however, expose an API to send the message automatically.  The framework requires user interaction.</p>

<p>It would be a <em>terrible</em> thing if an app could send a text message without user intervention.  If that were possible, then apps could fire off as many text messages as they wanted, to whomever they wanted, all while charges are getting applied to the user's cell phone bill.  That's a lawsuit waiting to happen.</p>

<p>So in a nutshell, you can pre-fill in some stuff, but the user will still have to tap the ""Send"" button.</p>

"<p>So I have this struct composed of three NSPoint structures.</p>

<pre><code>typedef struct AOTriangle_ {
    NSPoint a;
    NSPoint b;
    NSPoint c;
} AOTriangle;
</code></pre>

<p>I would like in some cases to reference the points as a,b,c and other cases as indices into an array.</p>

<p>Like so,</p>

<pre><code>AOTriangle t;
t.a = NSMakePoint(0,0);
t.b = NSMakePoint(3,0);
t.c = NSMakePoint(0,4);

for(int i = 0; i &lt; 3; ++i) {
    t[i].x += 5.0;
    t[i].y += 5.0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is the closest I've gotten, but you can see it isn't exactly what I wanted.
Is there a way of doing this in Objective-C? Is the a better way than what I do below of accomplishing something similar - maybe with a union?</p>

<pre><code>typedef struct AOTriangle_ {
    NSPoint a;
    NSPoint b;
    NSPoint c;
} AOTriangle;


AOTriangle t;
t.a = NSMakePoint(0,0);
t.b = NSMakePoint(3,0);
t.c = NSMakePoint(0,4);
NSPoint* t = (NSPoint*)&amp;triangle;
for(int i = 0; i &lt; 3; ++i) {
    t[i].x += 5.0;
    t[i].y += 5.0;
}
</code></pre>
","115730","","<p>Yes, you can use a ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_%28computer_science%29"" rel=""nofollow"">union</a>"".  I believe the declaration would go something like this:</p>

<pre><code>typedef struct AOTriangle_ {
    union {
        struct {
            NSPoint a;
            NSPoint b;
            NSPoint c;
        };
        NSPoint points[3];
    };
} AOTriangle;
</code></pre>

<p>A <code>union</code> is basically a way of saying ""I can refer to the members of this struct as either <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, or <code>c</code>, or as <code>points[0]</code>, <code>points[1]</code>, or <code>points[2]</code>.""</p>

<p>And you would use it like this:</p>

<pre><code>AOTriangle t;
t.a = NSMakePoint(0,0);
t.b = NSMakePoint(3,0);
t.c = NSMakePoint(0,4);
for(int i = 0; i &lt; 3; ++i) {
    t.points[i].x += 5.0;
    t.points[i].y += 5.0;
}

"<p>I think this is pretty simple but i'm new to Objective-C, IOS and Core Data.</p>

<p>I have a Core Data entity called EnquiryStore, which contains various attributes ""name"", ""address"", ""enquiry"" etc..</p>

<p>I can fetch the results fine but I struggling to understand how the results are stored! Which is making it hard for me to do the next part of my program which is to export the data to CSV using Dave DeLong's CHCSVWriter. I understand that to use </p>

<pre><code>[array writeToCSVFile:outputCSVFile atomically: NO];
</code></pre>

<p>It will accept an Array of Arrays, is this what Core Data gives me? Because i can't get it to work with that method.</p>

<p>I could use </p>

<pre><code>[myCSVWriter writeField: ...];
[myCSVWriter writeLine];
</code></pre>

<p>but this seems long winded as I will have to build the string from each attribute from Core Data.</p>
","115730","","<p>While the ""writeField:"" approach may seem long winded, it's also the most descriptive:</p>

<pre><code>CHCSVWriter *writer = [[CHCSVWriter alloc] initWithCSVFile:@""/Path/To/CSV/File.csv"" atomically:NO];

NSArray *myArrayOfManagedObjects = ...;
for (NSManagedObject *obj in myArrayOfManagedObjects) {

  [writer writeField:[obj valueForKey:@""attribute3""]];
  [writer writeField:[obj valueForKey:@""attribute4""]];
  [writer writeLine];
}

[writer closeFile];
[writer release];
</code></pre>

<p>Note that <code>writeField:</code> takes an <code>id</code> as the parameter, not an <code>NSString*</code>.  You can pass it any object that you want, and <code>CHCSVWriter</code> will grab the object's <code>-description</code> and write that out.  (This even happens with <code>NSString</code> objects that are passed in)  This happens because some modifications to the value have to take place (such as determining if the field needs quoting).</p>

"<p>I have an NSPredicateEditor that is part of a preference panel for a tool that I am making.</p>

<p>I would like to store the user's selections just as I would any other item in the NSUserDefaults object, but when I add the Binding to the NSPredicateEditor object and run the tool, it will not keep data and further it causes the other defaults to not show.

<p>What is the best way to store the NSPredicatedEditor data as a user preference?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
","115730","","<p>Whenever the UI of an <code>NSPredicateEditor</code> changes, those changes are immediately reflected in the editor's <code>objectValue</code> (ie, its represented <code>NSPredicate</code>).  So you can just grab that predicate and archive it using an <code>NSKeyedArchiver</code>.  This will effectively turn the predicate into an <code>NSData</code> object, which can be saved out to <code>NSUserDefaults</code>.</p>

<p>To read it back in, just grab the <code>NSData</code> object, run it through an <code>NSKeyedUnarchiver</code>, and <code>setObjectValue:</code> on your predicate editor.</p>

<p>You can <em>probably</em> accomplish this through bindings, though I have never tried it.  <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/CocoaBindingsRef/BindingsText/NSPredicateEditor.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/NSPredicateEditor-DontLinkElementID_428"" rel=""nofollow"">You can bind the <code>value</code> of an <code>NSPredicateEditor</code></a> to something that supplies an <code>NSPredicate</code> (or an <code>NSPredicate</code> in <code>NSData</code> form).

<p>The second one is doing a <em>comparison</em>.  It's going to take the value <code>1</code> and compare it to the value of <code>numberDiff</code>.  If the two values are equal, then the overall statement will produce a true value.</p>

<p>You're always seeing the results for the ""3"" case, because that's the last if statement.  The program is able to assign <code>3</code> into <code>numberDiff</code>, so it's going to update your <code>NSTextField</code> with the text from that case.</p>

Be warned, however, that when it says ""low level"", it means that.  This is a framework that deals with rendering characters directly.

","115730","","<p>You can't use <code>NSPredicate</code> on XML directly.  You'll have to parse the XML (or JSON) into some standard Cocoa container (<code>NSArray</code>, etc) and then use it on that.</p>

<p>The only way you'd be able to filter the XML directly is to use something like XPath, though you'd have to drop to libxml to do that.</p>

"<p>I have an NSTableView whose columns are bound to a subclass of NSArrayController.  Each entry of the 'value' column is a list of file paths (in the model), in particular, PATH and PYTHONPATH for an app.</p>

<p>What I want is to control edits to these values to as they are made, to ensure that each of the paths on the list is a valid one.  Since I'm using bindings, I'm thinking I should write some kind of NSPredicate but I'd like to have it use a function that I define to do the filter, since the testing is a bit complex.  How do you use a custom function with an NSPredicate?</p>

<p>Or should I consider another approach?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>I have figured out how to make the string containing filepaths into an expression that evaluates to what I want, using a category on NSString that adds the method <code>validate</code>. But I still don't know how to get it into a filter predicate.</p>

NSExpression *f = [NSExpression expressionForConstantValue:s];
NSExpression *e = [NSExpression expressionForFunction:f

                                            arguments:nil];

<p>I guess this would basically be a filter predicate that always spits out what the expression evaluates to..</p>
","115730","","<p>Pretty simple:</p>

<pre><code>NSString *s = @""~:~/Desktop"";
NSPredicate *p = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@""FUNCTION(%@, 'validate') == YES"", s];

<p>Or if you have an array of strings that you want to filter to find all the ones that pass validation:</p>

<pre><code>NSArray *array = ...; //your array of strings needing validation
NSPredicate *p = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@""FUNCTION(SELF, 'validate') == YES""];
NSArray *filtered = [array filteredArrayUsingPredicate:p];
</code></pre>

<p>One thing to note here is that the result of the <code>-validate</code> method <em><strong>MUST</strong></em> be an <code>id</code>.  So if it returns a true/false value, it should return a <code>BOOL</code> boxed in an <code>NSNumber</code>.  (The <code>YES</code> in the predicate format string is automatically converted into an <code>NSNumber</code> for you)</p>

"<p>Disclaimer, I'm new to Objective C.  But I can't find this explained.  I've seen two ways of implementing init:</p>

<pre><code>- (id)init {

  if ([super init]) {
    return self;
  } else {
    return nill;
  }

}
</code></pre>

<p>and </p>

    if (self = [super init]) {
      // do your init business here
    } 
    return self;
}
</code></pre>

<p>so let's say i have:</p>

<pre><code>myObj = [[MyObject alloc] init];
</code></pre>

<p>where MyObject class is a subclass of NSObject.  in the second example, does init not return an initialized version of NSObject?  so myObj would ... how would it know what it is?  wouldn't it think it was an NSObject rather than a MyObject?</p>
","115730","","<blockquote>
  <p>i just want to know, under the hood, how it does it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's pretty simple.  99.9% of all the classes you'll <em>ever</em> write will inherit from <code>NSObject</code> in some fashion.  In the initializers, you're supposed to invoke <code>super</code>'s designated initializer and assign it to <code>self</code>.  Eventually, <code>[super init]</code> will be invoking <code>-[NSObject init]</code>.  <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjectiveC/Chapters/ocAllocInit.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001163-CH22-SW2"" rel=""nofollow"">According to the documentation</a>, that's implemented like this:</p>

<pre><code>- (id)init {
    return self;
}
</code></pre>

<p>So <em>technically</em>, if you inherit directly from <code>NSObject</code>, you're probably safe to not do the assignation of <code>self = [super init];</code>, because you know (and you're guaranteed) that this is equivalent to: <code>self = self;</code>, which is kind of pointless. Regardless, you should leave it in for consistency's sake.</p>

<p>However, once you start getting further down the inheritance chain, and <em>especially</em> when you're inheriting from opaque classes (ie, a class whose .m file you do not have), then things start getting shady.  It is possible that you'll come across a class whose designated initializer looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>- (id) initWithFoo:(id)aFoo {
  if ([aFoo isSuperFast]) {
    [self release];
    return [[SuperFastFooWrapper alloc] initWithFoo:aFoo];
  }
  self = [super init];
  if (self) {
    _foo = [aFoo retain];
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This isn't as common, but it does happen.  In this case, we're destroying <code>self</code> (<code>[self release]</code>, to balance the <code>alloc</code> call that immediately preceded this) and instead returning a different object.</p>
"
"<p>Is there a way to use an <code>NSCollectionView</code> without bindings?</p>
","115730","","<p>Yes, and you don't need to subclass it.</p>

<p>You can use the <code>content</code> property to give the <code>NSCollectionView</code> and array of objects.  For each one of those objects, the collection view will manufacture a new <code>NSCollectionViewItem</code> by <code>copy</code>ing its <code>itemPrototype</code> and setting its <code>representedObject</code> property to the corresponding item in the <code>content</code> array.</p>

<p>So what I did when I did this was to create a subclass of <code>NSCollectionViewItem</code> and then overrode its <code>setRepresentedObject:</code> method to receive the new object, forward it on to <code>super</code>, and then customize the collectionViewItem appropriately.  No subclassing of <code>NSCollectionView</code> was required.  (But don't forget to implement <code>-copyWithZone:</code>!)  I simply <code>alloc/init</code>ed one of these custom collectionViewItems and set it as the collectionView's <code>itemPrototype</code>.  <code>NSCollectionView</code> did the rest.</p>

<p>But isn't the object automatically autoreleased when it was send to me from NSURL class method? Thanks.</p>
","115730","","<p>This is the rule:</p>

<p>If you invoke a method that returns an object and:</p>

<ul>
<li>begins with <code>new</code></li>
<li>begins with <code>alloc</code></li>
<li>is <code>retain</code></li>
<li>contains <code>copy</code></li>
</ul>

<p>then you are responsible for releasing (or autoreleasing) the returned object.  The <em>only</em> time this would not be the case is if the documentation says otherwise.  You may also see in the header files that the method is annotated with the <code>NS_RETURNS_RETAINED</code> macro.  (The header file counts as documentation)</p>

<p>An easy way to remember this is ""NARC"" (new-alloc-retain-copy).</p>

<p>In your example, since <code>URLWithString:</code> does not begin with <code>new</code> or <code>alloc</code>, does not contain <code>copy</code>, and is not <code>retain</code>, then you <strong>must not</strong> release the returned object.  Doing so is a violation of the memory management guidelines and will cause your app to crash (unless you're doing something stupid elsewhere).</p>

"<p>i created an NSMutableString with the method stringWithCapacity:5

","115730","","<p>The <code>*WithCapacity</code> methods that we see on <code>NSString</code>, <code>NSArray</code>, etc, have nothing to do with pre-populating the contents of the object.  They are simply a means by which you can <em>suggest</em> to the object how much it's going to hold.  If you suggest a large enough number, it may use a different storage mechanism than if it were a small number.</p>

<p>So in other words, you could do <code>[NSMutableString stringWithCapacity:1234567890]</code> and it give you exactly the same thing as if you had simply done <code>[NSMutableString string]</code>, and the <code>-length</code> of the resulting object will <strong>always</strong> be 0.</p>

<p>Do you see the problem?  It's treating ""fullname"" as a raw string, and not as the name of a field.  This is because you're using the <code>%@</code> modifier in the format string.  When <code>NSPredicate</code> comes across those, it says ""aha! the value that gets substituted in here will be a constant"".  What you really want it to do is say ""aha! the value that gets substituted in here will be an identifier"".</p>

<p>So instead of using <code>%@</code>, use <code>%K</code>.  This is a special modifier just for predicates, and it means to substitute in the string as an identifier (really as a ""keypath""), which means it will make your predicate be:</p>

","115730","","<p>You can use the <code>predicateWithBlock:</code> approach that @lxt suggested, or you can use the <code>FUNCTION</code> approach.  This would have you build a predicate that looks like this:</p>

<p>If you use that predicate to filter an array, then:</p>

<p>So why might you want to use this approach over the block approach?  I can think of two reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Backwards Compatibility
<ul>
<li>If you need this to work on Leopard (blocks on the Mac were introduced in Snow Leopard).</li>
<li>If you need this to work on iOS pre-4.0 (blocks on iOS were introduced in iOS 4.0).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>You want to serialize the predicate for archival and later retrieval.  This is fine as long as <code>aParameter</code> conforms to the <code>&lt;NSCoding&gt;</code> protocol.  Blocks cannot be serialized.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, if neither of those are requirements, then the block approach will probably be better in the long run, since it's more obvious and readable.  :)</p>

","115730","","<p>(Adding this as an answer since it would be pretty cumbersome to put it as a comment)</p>

<p>I strongly suggest using <a href=""http://github.com/ccgus/fmdb"" rel=""nofollow"">FMDB</a> to interact with the database instead.  It's a wrapper around the SQLite C API that makes it very easy to interact with a database.  Your code could be changed to use it with pretty minimal intervention.  Here's what it would look like:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)initializeDatabaseWithFilter:(NSString *)filter
{
    self.frister = [NSMutableArray array];

    NSArray *paths = NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(NSDocumentDirectory, NSUserDomainMask, YES);
    NSString *documentsDirectory = [paths objectAtIndex:0];
    NSString *path = [documentsDirectory stringByAppendingPathComponent:@""Frister.sqlite""];

    FMDatabase *db = [FMDatabase databaseWithPath:path];
    if ([db open]) {
        NSString *sql = [NSString stringWithFormat:@""SELECT fristKey FROM frister WHERE %@ = 1"", filter];
        FMResultSet *results = [db executeQuery:sql];
        while([results next]) {
            int primaryKey = [results intForColumn:@""fristKey""];
            Frist *td = [[Frist alloc] initWithOwnerID:primaryKey database:db];
            [[self frister] addObject:td];
            [td release];
        }
        [db close];
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Doesn't that look a <strong>TON</strong> more readable?  It's pretty easy to see that you're executing a query, iterating through the results, and pulling the ""fristKey"" out in order to make a ""Frist"" object.  You don't have to worry about <code>sqlite3_open</code>, preparing statements, binding parameters, or finalizing statements.</p>

<p>The other thing you'd have to change is the <code>Frist</code> object: it needs to accept a <code>FMDatabase*</code> as it's ""database"" instead of a <code>sqlite3*</code>.  You may also consider just opening the database once and then leaving it open until you don't need it anymore (otherwise you'll have to <code>-open</code> it every time you want to execute something; this is entirely up to you).</p>

<p>To include FMDB in your app, download the code from Github, and then copy the FMDatabase, FMDatabaseAdditions, and FMResultSet files (all 6) into your app, and <code>#import</code> them where you'll need to interact with the database.  You'll still need to link against sqlite3.dylib.</p>

<p>Just be sure you honor the (very permissive) <a href=""https://github.com/ccgus/fmdb/blob/master/LICENSE.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">license</a>.</p>

","115730","","<p>So if you have an <code>NSDate *today = [NSDate date];</code>, then you can use <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSDateComponents_Class/Reference/Reference.html"" rel=""nofollow""><code>NSDateComponents</code></a> to get relative dates.</p>

<pre><code>NSCalendar *calendar = [NSCalendar currentCalendar];

[twoWeeksAgoComponents setWeek:-2];

</code></pre>

<p>Etc.</p>

<p><code>NSDateComponents</code> and <code>NSCalendar</code> handle underflowing and overflowing automatically (unless you turn it off with the <code>options:</code> bit).  So if today is ""28 February"" and you want ""tomorrow"", it will automatically choose either ""29 February"" or ""1 March"" depending on the year.  It's pretty cool.

"<p>What class can I use to associate an index in a NSMutableIndexSet to an object?</p>
","115730","","<p>If you want to use a raw integer as the key to an object, you can use a <code>CFMutableDictionaryRef</code> instead.  This is going to drop you down a layer from Cocoa into CoreFoundation, but it'll still work just fine:</p>

"<p>I'm doing an HTTP Post in my iphone app and one of the parameters I send to the server is a URL.

<p>thanks for taking the time to read!</p>
","115730","","<p>You're not percent-escaping the query values before substituting them in to the string.  I just did a little test, and found that if I set <code>urlToPublish</code> to ""http://example.com"", then <code>NSURL</code> would transform it into ""http:/example.com"".</p>

<p>This is because the query value contains special characters, which means you need to add percent escapes.  At the very least you can use the mediocre <code>-[NSString stringByAddingPercentEscapesUsingEncoding:]</code> with the <code>NSASCIIStringEncoding</code>.  Far better would be to use a different (and more complete) escaping mechanism, such as the one I suggest <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3423545/objective-c-iphone-percent-encode-a-string/3426140#3426140"">in this post</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p>In this case, <code>stringByAddingPercentEscapesUsingEncoding:</code> does not work, because it's a pretty lousy method.  It works on an <em>inclusive</em> model, which means you have to tell it which characters you want percent encoded.  (Under the hood, it's just calling <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/CoreFoundation/Reference/CFURLRef/Reference/reference.html#//apple_ref/c/func/CFURLCreateStringByAddingPercentEscapes""><code>CFURLCreateStringByAddingPercentEscapes()</code></a>)  This function basically asks you for a string that represents every character it's allowed to percent-encode (as I understand the function).  What you really want is an <em>exclusive</em> model: escape everything except [this small set of characters].  The function I linked to above does that, and you'd use it like this:</p>

<pre><code>NSString *urlToPublish = [@""http://stackoverflow.com"" URLEscapedString_ch];
NSString *host = @""example.host.com"";
NSString *urlString = [NSString stringWithFormat:@""/SetLeaderUrl.json?leader_email=%@&amp;url=%@"",localEmail,urlToPublish];
NSURL *url = [[NSURL alloc] initWithScheme:@""http"" host:host path:urlString];
</code></pre>

<p>And then it will build your URL properly.</p>

<hr>

<p>Here's another way you could do this (and do it <strong>correctly</strong>).  Go to <a href=""https://github.com/davedelong/Demos/tree/master/DDURLBuilder"">my github page</a> and download ""DDURLBuilder.h"" and ""DDURLBuilder.m"", and then build your URL like this:</p>

","115730","","<ol>
<li>Use <code>retain</code> as your property attribute, unless you have a good reason not to (ex: <code>retain</code> would cause a retain cycle, it's a primitive, you need to guarantee the object is immutable, etc)</li>
<li>Use the first example you posted, since the second one would leak memory.</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>If you use <code>assign</code> as your property attribute, then the first option would probably crash:</p>

<ol>
<li>Allocate an array (owned by you)</li>
<li>Assigned to a property (still owned by you)</li>
<li>Release (no owners, promptly deallocated)</li>
<li>Attempt to access property value: crash (because the pointer is stale)</li>
</ol>

<p>The second one, however, would work:</p>

<ol>
<li>Allocate an array (+1 owners)</li>
<li>Copy the array (original: +1 owners, copy: +1 owners)</li>
<li>Assign the copy into the property (both still have +1 owners)</li>
<li>Release the original array (it gets deallocated, the copy continues to exist)</li>
</ol>

<p>Regardless, it is rather unconventional to have an <code>assign</code> property and then manage the retention of the value yourself.  It is extremely error-prone, and much simpler to declare the property as <code>retain</code> and let the generated setter take care of the <code>release</code>/<code>retain</code> dance for you.</p>

"<p>So it's late here, and my google skills seem to be failing me. I've found some great responses on SO before (time and time again), I thought you guys could help. </p>

<p>I have a neural network I'm trying to run in native objective-c. It works, but it's too slow. These networks are not recurrent. Each network I run about 20,000 times ( 128x80 times, or around that). The problem is these networks really just boil down to math functions (each network is a 4 dimensional function, taking x,y,dist(x,y),and bias as inputs, and outputting 3 values). </p>

<p>What I want to do is convert each network (only once) into a function call, or a block of code at runtime in objective-c.</p>

<p>How do I do this? I could make a big string of the math operations that need to be performed, but how do I go about executing that string, or converting the string into a block of code for execution?</p>

<p>Again, my late night search failed me, so sorry if this has already been answered. Any help is greatly appreciated. </p>

<p>-Paul</p>

<p>Edit: Aha! Great success! Nearly 24 hours later, I have working code to turn a neural network with up to 4 inputs into a single 4 dimensional function. I used the block method suggested by Dave DeLong in the answers.</p>

<p>For anybody who ever wants to follow what I've done in the future, here is a (quick) breakdown of what I did (excuse me if this is incorrect etiquette on stackoverflow): 
First, I made a few typedef's for the different block functions: </p>

<pre><code>typedef CGFloat (^oneDFunction)(CGFloat x);
typedef CGFloat (^twoDFunction)(CGFloat x, CGFloat y);
typedef CGFloat (^threeDFunction)(CGFloat x, CGFloat y, CGFloat z);
typedef CGFloat (^fourDFunction)(CGFloat x, CGFloat y, CGFloat z, CGFloat w);
</code></pre>

<p>A oneDFunction takes the form of f(x), twoD is f(x,y), etc. Then I made functions to combine two fourDFunction blocks (and 2 oneD, 2 twoD, etc, although these were not necessary). </p>

<pre><code>fourDFunction (^combineFourD) (fourDFunction f1, fourDFunction f2) =
  ^(fourDFunction f1,     fourDFunction f2){
    fourDFunction blockToCopy = ^(CGFloat x, CGFloat y, CGFloat z, CGFloat w){
        return f1(x,y,z,w) + f2(x,y,z,w);
    };
    fourDFunction act = [blockToCopy copy];
    [f1 release];
    [f2 release];
    //Need to release act at some point
    return act;            
};
</code></pre>

<p>And, of course, I needed to apply the activation function to the fourD function for every node, and for each node, I would need to multiply by the weight connecting it:</p>

<pre><code>//for applying the activation function
fourDFunction (^applyOneToFourD)( oneDFunction f1, fourDFunction f2) = 
^(oneDFunction f1, fourDFunction f2){
    fourDFunction blockToCopy = ^(CGFloat x, CGFloat y, CGFloat z, CGFloat w){
        return f1(f2(x,y,z,w));
    };    

    fourDFunction act = [blockToCopy copy];
    [f1 release];
    [f2 release];

    //Need to release act at some point
    return act; 

};

//For applying the weight to the function
fourDFunction (^weightCombineFour) (CGFloat x, fourDFunction f1) =
 ^(CGFloat weight, fourDFunction f1)
{
    fourDFunction blockToCopy = ^(CGFloat x, CGFloat y, CGFloat z, CGFloat w){

        return weight*f1(x,y,z,w);
    };

    fourDFunction act = [blockToCopy copy];
    [f1 release];
    //[act release];
    //Need to release act at some point
   return act;
</code></pre>

<p>};</p>

<p>Then, for each node in the network, I simply applied the activation function to the sum of the fourD functions from the source neurons multiplied by their connection weight.
After composing all those blocks, I took the final functions from each output. Therefore, my outputs are separate 4D functions of the inputs. </p>

<p>Thanks for the help, this was very cool. </p>

","115730","","<p>You've got your timezones messed up.  IIRC, <code>NSDateFormatter</code> (by default) will parse stuff in the UTC timezone (+000), but dates are <code>NSLog</code>ged in your current timezone.  Or something like that.</p>

"<p>If that was a little confusing here's a visual representation:</p>

<p>Array > Object > Dictionary > Values</p>

<p>Here's some context if this helps:</p>

<p>An array contain playlists.  Each playlist has a dictionary.  Each dictionary contains metadata.</p>

<p>I need to sort the original dictionary by this metadata.</p>

<p>I've been pretty stumped at implementing this.  Thoughts?</p>

<p><strong>[Edit]</strong> Changed the higher dictionary into an array</p>
","115730","","<p>You want to use at least one <code>NSSortDescriptor</code>. This is basically an abstract way of representing a way to sort something. It can contain a key path (more on that in a second) or a function pointer, or some other way to compare two objects. </p>

<p>You'll probably want to use it with a key path. So if you have an array of <code>Foo</code> objects,  and they have a ""dictionary"" property that returns an <code>NSDictionary</code>,  and you want to sort the array based on a value in the dictionary under the key <code>@""bar""</code>, then the sort descriptor you'd create would be:</p>

<pre><code>[NSSortDescriptor sortDescriptorWithKey:@""dictionary.bar"" ascending:YES]
</code></pre>

<p>From here you can use <code>-[NSArray sortedArrayUsingDescriptors]</code> and pass it an array containing this <code>NSSortDescriptor</code>. </p>

","115730","","<p>BJ's correct that you need to follow the rules of memory management, but in this case, the answer <em>does</em> have to do with blocks.</p>

<p>As your code currently stands, the normal property of <code>array</code> will work <em>until the current autorelease pool drains</em>.  If you alloc/init one of these ""class1"" objects and immediately attempt to use the <code>array</code> property, it will work (because no autorelease pool will have been drained between the initialization of the object and the time at which you attempt to access the array).</p>

<p>However, once you put the block in there, this is no longer the case.  When you declare a block using the <code>^{ ... }</code> syntax, this block is allocated in the current frame on the call stack.  When you <code>return</code> from the init method, the current frame is popped.  The block ivar still holds a memory address, but a block no longer exists at that address.  It was destroyed when the stack frame was removed.</p>

<p>The way to avoid this is to copy the block off of the stack and onto the heap, and then use <em>that</em> block instead:</p>

<pre><code>test = [^{  NSLog(@""block!""); } copy];

"<p>Is there any reason to use a property for an ivar that is only being used internally in a class?</p>

<p>I can see that use of properties in objective-c for a class assist other classes accessing the instance variables, however for just internal usage of an instance variable is there any benefit/need to use a property for it?  In fact for the property you have to be ""self."" before it to access it it seems, as opposed to just the name of the instance variable.  </p>

NSPredicate *filter = [NSCompoundPredicate orPredicateWithSubpredicates:subpredicates];
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can use <code>filter</code> to filter your <code>NSArray</code> (using <code>-filteredArrayUsingPredicate</code>).</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, you have an array of arbitrary dictionaries that all have different keys, you'd need to something a bit more perverse:</p>

<pre><code>NSPredicate *filter = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@""SUBQUERY(FUNCTION(SELF, 'allKeys'), $k, SELF[$k] contains[cd] %@).@count &gt; 0"", searchText];
</code></pre>

<p>A bit about what this is doing:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>FUNCTION(SELF, 'allKeys')</code> - this will execute <code>-allKeys</code> on <code>SELF</code> (an <code>NSDictionary</code>) and return an <code>NSArray</code> of all the keys in the dictionary</li>
<li><code>SUBQUERY(allKeys, $k, SELF[$k] contains[cd] %@)</code> - This will iterate over every item in <code>allKeys</code>, with each successive item being placed into the <code>$k</code> variable.  For each item, it will execute <code>SELF[$k] contains %@</code>.  This will basically end up doing: <code>[theDictionary objectForKey:$k] contains[cd] %@</code>.  If this returns <code>YES</code>, then the <code>$k</code> item will be aggregated into a new array.</li>
<li><code>SUBQUERY(...).@count &gt; 0</code> - after finding all of the keys that correspond to values that contain your search text, we check and see if there were any.  If there were (ie, the size of the array is larger than 0), then the overall dictionary will be part of the final, filtered array.</li>
</ul>

<p>I recommend going with the first approach, if at all possible.  <code>SUBQUERY</code> and <code>FUNCTION</code> are a bit arcane, and the first is <em>much</em> easier to understand.</p>

<hr>

<p>And here's another way, which you actually almost had in your question.  Instead of doing <code>ANY SELF.allValues contains[cd] %@</code>, you can do <code>ANY FUNCTION(SELF, 'allValues') contains[cd] %@</code>.  This is equivalent to my <code>SUBQUERY</code> madness, but much simpler.  Kudos to you for thinking of using <code>ANY</code> (I usually forget that it exists).</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>The reason <code>SELF.allValues</code> doesn't work, is that this is interpreted as a keypath, and <code>-[NSDictionary valueForKey:]</code> <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSDictionary_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000140-BBCIBCDJ"">is supposed to be the same as</a> <code>-[NSDictionary objectForKey:]</code>.  The catch here is that if you prefix the key with <code>@</code>, then it forwards on to <code>[super valueForKey:]</code>, which <em>will</em> do what you're expecting.  So you could really do:</p>

<pre><code>ANY SELF.@allValues contains[cd] %@
</code></pre>

<p>Or simply:</p>

<pre><code>ANY @allValues contains[cd] %@
</code></pre>

<p>And this will work (and is the best and simplest approach).</p>

"<p>What the difference between a method, a selector and a message in Objective-C? </p>
","115730","","<p>This is a great question.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Selector</strong> - a Selector is the <em>name</em> of a method.  You're very familiar with these selectors: <code>alloc</code>, <code>init</code>, <code>release</code>, <code>dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:</code>, <code>setObject:forKey:</code>, etc.  Note that the colon is part of the selector; it's how we identify that this method requires parameters.  Also (though it's extremely rare), you can have selectors like this: <code>doFoo:::</code>.  This is a method that takes three parameters, and you'd invoke it like <code>[someObject doFoo:arg1 :arg2 :arg3]</code>.  There's no requirement that there be letters before each part of the selector components.  As I said, this is extremely rare, and you will not find it used in the Cocoa frameworks.  You can work with selectors directly in Cocoa.  They have the type <code>SEL</code>:  <code>SEL aSelector = @selector(doSomething:)</code> or <code>SEL aSelector = NSSelectorFromString(@""doSomething:"");</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Message</strong> - a message is a selector and the arguments you are sending with it.  If I say <code>[dictionary setObject:obj forKey:key]</code>, then the ""message"" is the selector <code>setObject:forKey:</code> plus the arguments <code>obj</code> and <code>key</code>.  Messages can be encapsulated in an <code>NSInvocation</code> object for later invocation.  Messages are sent to a <em>receiver</em>.  (ie, the object that ""receives"" the message).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Method</strong> - a method is a combination of a selector and an implementation (and accompanying metadata).  The ""implementation"" is the actual block of code; it's a function pointer (an <code>IMP</code>).  An actual method can be retrieved internally using a <code>Method</code> struct (retrievable from the runtime).</p></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>Some other related things that you didn't ask for:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Method Signature</strong> - a method signature represents the data types returned by and accepted by a method.  They can be represented at runtime via an <code>NSMethodSignature</code> and (in some cases) a raw <code>char*</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implementation</strong> - the actual executable code of a method.  Its type at runtime is an <code>IMP</code>, and it's really just a function pointer.  iOS 4.3 includes a new ability to turn a block into an <code>IMP</code>. This is <em>really cool</em>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>One of the fun things to realize is that the <em>name</em> of a method (the selector) is distinct from the <em>implementation</em> of the method (the IMP).  This means that you can swap them around, if you're feeling daring.  You can also add and remove methods at runtime, because all you're doing is editing an entry in a hash table: the key is the selector, and the value is the <code>IMP</code> of the method.  This allows you to do some really crazy and trippy stuff.  It's not for the faint of heart. :)</p>

","115730","","<p>Oh man...</p>

<pre><code>if (newsPre.on = YES) {

<p>You need two equal signs there.  Otherwise you're invoking a setter method.  (See? Dot syntax is bad!)  As it currently stands, this is saying:  <code>if ([newsPre setOn:YES]) {</code>.  What you want is either <code>newsPre.on == YES</code> or <code>[newsPre on] == YES</code>.</p>

<pre><code>    NSArray *newsArray = [NSArray AarrayWithObjects = @""News"", @""Latest"", @""Trending"", nil;]
</code></pre>

<p>First, the semicolon goes <em>after</em> the bracket.  It's supposed to be the last thing on the line.  Also, ""AarrayWithObjects"" should be ""arrayWithObjects"", and that extra ""="" in the middle of the line should be "":"".</p>

<pre><code>    for(int i=0, i&lt;3, ++i;) {
</code></pre>

<p>Those commas are supposed to be semi colons</p>

<pre><code>        NSString *newText = [NSString stringWithFormat:@""%@"", sufField, newsArray objectAtIndex: i];
</code></pre>

<p>You only have one substitution modifier (<code>%@</code>), but you're trying to substitute in 2 values.  Additionally, you need brackets around ""<code>newsArray objectAtIndex:i</code>""</p>

<pre><code>        display.text=newText;
</code></pre>

<p>Hooray!  A syntactically correct line!  However, this is happening on <em>every</em> iteration of the loop.  So every time you loop, you're changing the text of <code>display</code>. Are you sure that's what you want?</p>

<p>If you want to avoid them, however, you might consider making a <code>LoaderManager</code> class that simply owns the <code>Loader</code> objects until they're done loading stuff.  It'd essentially be a wrapper around an array, and you'd use it like this (or something):</p>

<strong>~SOLVED~</strong><br/><br/>
Thank's to all for answers. 
I've got a lot of useful information about this question. I'm going to use NSString *str = @""text"" instead of NSString *str = [[NSString alloc] initWithString:@""text""];</p>

<p>i've understood that release just ""marks"" memory as ""willing to be freed"", but not freeing it immediatly</p>
","115730","","<p>When you do:</p>

<pre><code>NSString * str = [[NSString alloc] initWithString:@""test""];
</code></pre>

<p>This gets optimized into:</p>

<pre><code>NSString * str = @""test"";
</code></pre>

<p>You can't <code>release</code> a constant string, because it's hardcoded into the application binary.</p>

<p>Proof:</p>

<pre><code>NSString *s = [NSString alloc];
NSLog(@""%p"", s);
s = [s initWithString:@""foo""];
NSLog(@""%p"", s);
s = @""foo"";
NSLog(@""%p"", s);

"<p>Bit of an issue with Xcode 4's predicate editor controls - I think I'm doing everything right, and it really seems like the IDE itself is busted.</p>

<p>I'm having this issue in an app I'm writing, but to isolate it, I did the following:</p>

<p>Create a new project with a window. In the XIB editor, add an NSPredicateEditor to it, and add one line. Leave it as key paths/strings and add two key paths - ""title"" and ""writer"". Make it case and diacritical insensitive.</p>

<p>Create a subclass of NSWindowController and add an IBOutlet for the predicate editor.</p>

<p>In awakeFromNib, put the following code:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>NSPredicate *myPredicate = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat: @""(title CONTAINS[CD] %@) AND (writer CONTAINS[CD] %@)"", @"""", @""""];</p>
  
  <p>[_predicateEditor setObjectValue:myPredicate];</p>

<p>Am I right in thinking I'm not doing anything wrong here, and this should work? If I change the predicate editor row template away from key paths, then switch it back to key paths, and edit the list of key paths, Xcode crashes with an internal consistency exception, which makes me think maybe Xcode 4 is not up to snuff when it comes to predicate editing.</p>

<p>Anyone got any ideas? I've tried creating an NSPredicateEditor in code rather than the XIB editor, and endless messing around to no avail. The predicate editing functionality is all that's holding me up releasing an app to the store, so this is kind of an annoyance.</p>

<p>I think the problem is stemming from the assignment to <code>self</code>, though I'm not sure of that.  <code>NSArray</code> does some funky optimizations under the hood, and so I would avoid calling an <code>NSArray</code> initializer until <em>after</em> you have all your data ready to go.</p>

"<p>I'm attempting to get around a date validation that refuses to take anything earlier than tomorrow.<br>
So far I have this:</p>

<pre><code>NSDate *dateY = [NSDate dateWithTimeIntervalSinceNow:-86400];

NSLog(@""%@"", dateY);
    // ""yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss Z"", same accuracy (minus one day)

<p>That's great, but <code>dateY</code> is not an <code>NSNumber</code>. I need an <code>NSNumber</code> for the comparison, but I can't find anything that works. (I don't even know how an <code>NSNumber</code> can be <code>2011-04-14 13:22:29 +0000</code>, anyway...)</p>

<p>I can use <code>NSDateFormatter</code> to convert an <code>NSDate</code> into an <code>NSString</code>, so if it would be possible to take that string and convert it to the required <code>NSNumber</code> (as opposed to directly converting the <code>NSDate</code> to an <code>NSNumber</code>, which I can't seem to find help with either), that would be fine.</p>

<p>it actually causes Xcode to crash.</p>

Later on I need to bombard that set with many thousands of points per second to see if they exist in the set. My approach seems crude for achieving this. I thought about creating something like a huge 2-dimensional bit array, with each index representing a pixel on screen. Once I know the point I'm testing for, I can just jump straight to that point in the array and check for a 1 or 0... does this sound better or worse?</p>

<h1><strong>IT IS NOT, AND YOU SHOULD FORGET THAT <code>retainCount</code> EXISTS</strong></h1>

<p>But here's what happens:</p>

<pre><code>NSMutableString *ms = [[NSMutableString alloc]init];
</code></pre>

<p>You have created a mutable string.  <em>You own it and are responsible for <code>releasing</code> it</em></p>

<pre><code>[ms appendFormat:@""element %ld"",1];

<p>You create a copy of the string.  <em>You own the copy and are responsible for <code>releasing</code> it</em></p>

<pre><code>NSValue *sw = [NSValue valueWithNonretainedObject:ms2];
</code></pre>

<p>You store the pointer to your string copy in an <code>NSValue</code>. You do not own the <code>NSValue</code> (and thus do not have to <code>release</code> it), and since you're using the <code>NonretainedObject:</code> variant, the ownership of the <code>ms2</code> object is unchanged.</p>

<pre><code>NSMutableArray *a = [NSMutableArray array];
</code></pre>

<p>You create a mutable array.  You do not own it.</p>

<pre><code>[a addObject:ms];
</code></pre>

<p>You add an object to the array.  <em>The array now also owns the object</em></p>

<pre><code>[a addObject:sw];
</code></pre>

<p>You add an object to the array.  <em>The array now owns the object</em> (you still do not own it)</p>

<p>So at the end of this code, you own:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>ms</code></li>
<li><code>ms2</code></li>
</ul>

<p>This means that for your code to be correct, you should also have:</p>

<pre><code>[ms release];
[ms2 release];
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>How do you know when you ""own"" an object and when you do not?  It's pretty simple:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you retrieve an object via a method that begins with the word ""<code>alloc</code>"" or...</li>
<li>If you retrieve an object via a method that begins with the word ""<code>new</code>"" or...</li>
<li>If you retrieve an object via a method that contains the word ""<code>copy</code>"" or...</li>
<li>If you explicitly ""<code>retain</code>"" the object</li>
</ul>

    [arrRecipients addObject:@""xxxxxxx@gmail.com""];


    MFMailComposeViewController *mailController = [[MFMailComposeViewController alloc] init];

    [mailController setSubject:@""Ravikiran test mail""];
    [mailController setToRecipients:arrRecipients];

    [mailController setMessageBody:@""this is my test app"" isHTML:YES];
    [self presentModalViewController:mailController animated:YES];
    [mailController release];
}

<p>it is sending mail but it is navigating to mail composer page  &amp; then its sending but i need to send mail just on click of the button</p>
","115730","","<p>No, you cannot use <code>MFMailComposeViewController</code> to send an email without user interaction.  There are probably 3rd parties libraries that let you do this, but the iOS SDK does not allow you to.</p>

<p>Also, you're leaking the <code>arrRecipients</code> array.</p>

","115730","","<p>Um... <code>opacity</code> is not a boolean value.  It is a <code>float</code> in the range from 0.0 (fully transparent) to 1.0 (fully opaque).  The property is actually called the <code>alpha</code>, so you'd do:</p>

"<p>I am very new to Xcode and trying - as millions - to parse a CSV file. I have read many contributions and I am managing it but I have a problem when my NSScanner intercepts an empty field: ""Field_A, Field_B,, Field_D"". I guess it is because it ignores empty space by default, or in this case no space at all.</p>

<p>String is:</p>

<p>""Personal"",""2011-01-01"",""Personal"",""Cigarettes"",,4.60,""Cash"","""",</p>

<p>I tried to debug it using scanLocation:</p>

<pre><code>2011-04-22 15:57:32.414 Spending[42015:a0f] Before while...scan location is:0

2011-04-22 15:57:32.415 Spending[42015:a0f] Category: ""Personal"" - scan location is:34
2011-04-22 15:57:32.416 Spending[42015:a0f] Subcategory: ""Cigarettes"" - scan location is:47
2011-04-22 15:57:32.416 Spending[42015:a0f] Income: 4.600000 - scan location is:53
2011-04-22 15:57:32.416 Spending[42015:a0f] Expense: 0.000000 - scan location is:53
2011-04-22 15:57:32.417 Spending[42015:a0f] Payment: ""Cash"" - scan location is:60

<p>And as you can see after that even expense field gets no value (should be 4.60).</p>

<p>Here is the relevant piece of code:</p>

<pre><code>NSScanner *scanner = [NSScanner scannerWithString:fileString];
    [scanner setCharactersToBeSkipped: [NSCharacterSet characterSetWithCharactersInString:@""\n, ""]];

    NSString *account, *date, *category, *subcategory, *payment, *note;
    float income, expense;

    // Set up data delimiter using comma
    NSCharacterSet *commaSet;
    commaSet = [NSCharacterSet characterSetWithCharactersInString:@"",""];

    NSLog (@""Before while...scan location is:%d\n"", scanner.scanLocation);

    [scanner scanUpToCharactersFromSet:commaSet intoString:&amp;account];
    NSLog(@""Account: %@ - scan location is:%d\n"",account, scanner.scanLocation);

    [scanner scanUpToCharactersFromSet:commaSet intoString:&amp;date];
    NSLog(@""Date: %@ - scan location is:%d\n"",date, scanner.scanLocation);

    [scanner scanUpToCharactersFromSet:commaSet intoString:&amp;category]; 
    NSLog(@""Category: %@ - scan location is:%d\n"",category, scanner.scanLocation);

    [scanner scanUpToCharactersFromSet:commaSet intoString:&amp;subcategory]; 
    NSLog(@""Subcategory: %@ - scan location is:%d\n"",subcategory, scanner.scanLocation);

    [scanner scanFloat:&amp;income];
    NSLog(@""Income: %f - scan location is:%d\n"",income, scanner.scanLocation);

    [scanner scanFloat:&amp;expense]; 
    NSLog(@""Expense: %f - scan location is:%d\n"",expense, scanner.scanLocation);

    [scanner scanUpToCharactersFromSet:commaSet intoString:&amp;payment]; 
    NSLog(@""Payment: %@ - scan location is:%d\n"",payment, scanner.scanLocation);

    [scanner scanUpToCharactersFromSet:commaSet intoString:&amp;note];
    NSLog(@""Note: %@\n - scan location is:%d"",note, scanner.scanLocation);

<p>For what you're doing, you could just take the file and run in through something like the <code>+[NSArray arrayWithContentsOfCSVFile:encoding:error:]</code> method, or you could read it into a string and do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>NSString *csv = @""\""Personal\"",\""2011-01-01\"",\""Personal\"",\""Cigarettes\"",,4.60,\""Cash\"",\""\"","";
NSLog(@""%@"", [csv CSVComponents]);

"<p>I am seeing a really strange behavior in core data.  I am doing a search for locations in core data (data store type is SQLite).  The query is to look for location objects within a specific area.  I am implementing the search as a <strong>between</strong> predicate.</p>

NSPredicate *predicate = [predicateTemplate predicateWithSubstitutionVariables:

<pre><code>NSExpression *ex = [NSExpression expressionForConstantValue : numberValue]
</code></pre>

<p>I am using the predicate in a NSFetchedResultsController, and the first time though works exactly as I expect.  The final predicate is something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>NSFetchRequest: 0x7394360 (entity: Location; predicate: (longitude
  BETWEEN {-122.0767937067412,
  -121.7137663065599} AND latitude BETWEEN {37.16973380897733,
  37.45968675392614} ); sortDescriptors: ((""(name, ascending, compare:)""));
  limit: 20; type:
  NSManagedObjectResultType; )</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And I get the results I want.</p>

<p>The second time this code is run (by pushing a second view on top, and closing that view.  This causes the view to reload).  The system crashes, with this error message.</p>

<p>Apple's already written the sorting code.  It just needs to know what properties to sort <em>by</em>.  That's what an <code>NSSortDescriptor</code> encapsulates.  Once you've got one, simply give it to the array, and the array give you back a sorted version.  (Alternatively, if you have an <code>NSMutableArray</code>, you can sort it in-place using <code>-sortUsingDescriptors:</code>)</p>

","115730","","<p>Yes. </p>

<p>It sounds like you're a bit confused about what's going on, so I'll explain a couple things:</p>

<ol>
<li>The memory was not allocated by <code>aInstance</code>. That's simply a spot in memory that holds a number. The memory was actually allocated by the <code>TheClass</code> class.</li>
<li>The allocation method allocated a chunk of memory in a totally seperate section of memory, and returned the <em>location</em> of that chunk as the result of the method. </li>
<li><code>aInstance</code> simply holds that location (which is a big number). That's it. This number is interpreted as a pointer (ie, a reference to another location in memory), but it doesn't have to be. You could use it as an int, if you're feeling adventurous. </li>
<li>When you do: <code>bInstance = aInstance;</code>, you're simply copying that number from one memory slot to another. You're not doing anything to the object reference by that variable. You're just duplicating an already existing pointer. </li>
<li>When you release the object, it will be deallocated, because only one thing owns it (you, by invoking the allocation method).</li>
<li>Deallocating an object does nothing to the things that were referencing it, so your variables will still contain the now-former address in memory of where the object used to live. In other words, they are ""dangling"" or ""stale"" pointers, and it's recommended that you zero them out (by assigning <code>nil</code> to them). </li>

"<p>So I am new to iphone development, but am trying to learn how to take a file that is CSV and read it and save it using Core Data (I think that is the best way?) so that I can display it in a tableview on the iphone.  Below is an example of the type of csv file I am working with;</p>

14,2,1,Math,,,,,,1<br>
,311,1,Kim,Mary,Freshman<br>
,352,2,Doe,Fred,Senior  </p>

<p>Where the first number is the type of class (i.e. 13 = history), the second number is how many sections (i.e. 1 = 1 class) the third number is the meeting pattern (i.e. 1 = monday, wednesday, friday), then the name of the class.  The rest of the class line I don't really care about, so I thought I could just have it ignore those characters.</p>

<p>For the 2nd and 3rd lines, the first number after the comma is the student number, then seat number, then last name, first name, year in school.</p>

<p>So I have two main challenges I think.  First being how to parse the data so that I can know many and who is in each class so I can call it into a table view (and add to it later), and then I don't know how to associate a integer value with the meeting pattern or class name (i.e. 13 = history, and 1 = Mon/Wed/Fri)</p>

"<p>I've got a short question. I have an <code>NSArray</code> filled with <code>Cars</code> (which inherits from NSObject).  <code>Car</code> has the <code>@property NSString *engine</code> (also regarded <code>@synthesize</code>)</p>

<p>Now I want to filter the array using <code>NSPredicate</code>:</p>

<pre><code>predicate = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:[NSString stringWithFormat:@""(engine like %@)"", searchText]];
newArray = [ArrayWithCars filteredArrayUsingPredicate:predicate];
</code></pre>

<p>This throws an <code>valueForUndefinedKey</code> error.  Is the <code>predicateWithFormat</code> correct?</p>

<p>Thanks for your responses.</p>
","115730","","<p>Here's the real reason why it's not working:</p>

<p>When you build a string using <code>stringWithFormat:</code>, it's going to come up looking like this:</p>

<pre><code>@""engine like searchText""
</code></pre>

<p>You then pass it to <code>predicateWithFormat:</code>, which is going to see that both the lefthand side and the righthand side of the comparison are <em>unquoted</em> strings, which means it's going to interpret them as if they were <em>keypaths</em>.</p>

<p>When this code runs, it's going to be doing:</p>

<pre><code>id leftValue = [object valueForKey:@""engine""];
id rightValue = [object valueForKey:@""searchText""];
return (leftValue is like rightValue);
</code></pre>

<p>The exception getting thrown is your object complaining that it doesn't have a method named ""searchText"", which is correct.</p>

<p>Contrast this to if you took out the <code>stringWithFormat:</code> call and just put everything directly into <code>predicateWithFormat:</code>:</p>

<pre><code>NSPredicate *p = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@""engine like %@"", searchText];
</code></pre>

<p><code>predicateWithFormat:</code> is smart.  It sees ""aha, a <code>%@</code> replacement pattern! this means I can pop an argument off the argument list and box it up and use it as-is"".  That's exactly what it's going to do.  It's going to pop the value of <code>searchText</code> off the argument list, box it in an <code>NSExpression</code>, and insert it directly into the parsed expression tree.</p>

<p>What's most interesting here is that the expression it creates will be a <em>constant value</em> expression.  This means it's a literal value; not a key path, not a collection, etc.  It will be the literal string.  Then when your predicate runs, it's going to do:</p>

<pre><code>id leftValue = [object valueForKey:@""engine""];
id rightValue = [rightExpression constantValue];
return (leftValue is like rightValue);
</code></pre>

<p>And <em>that</em> is correct, and is also why you should not pass stuff through <code>stringWithFormat:</code> before passing it to <code>predicateWithFormat:</code>.</p>

"<p>I've been trying to change the height of a pickerView. I would like it to show a single row instead of the default five rows.
help me plz</p>
","115730","","<p>You can't. <code>UIPickerView</code> can show either 5 rows or 3 rows, depending on the height of the frame you pass to the <code>-setFrame:</code> method. When I need a short <code>UIPickerView</code>, I'll pass a height of 100. The code in UIKit will adjust that height to be the closest allowed value. </p>

<p>I'll also note that this is for a very good reason. A one row pickerView, as has been noted elsewhere, would be fiendishly difficult to scroll. Also, the number of visible rows must be odd so that the currently selected row will be centered vertically. This means 3 or 5 rows, because 7 would make the thing way too tall to be practical on an iPhone. </p>

"<p>We know that NSDate is UTC/GMT. In order words, no time zone info is associated with it.</p>

(gdb) po stopDate
2011-04-03 15:52:13 +0000
(gdb) p (int) day
$1 = 2
</code></pre>

<p>The timezone is Pacific Standard Time and the dates above converted to PST are:</p>

<pre><code>startDate = 2011-03-31 8:52:13 -7

","115730","","<p>Not quite.  When you format the dates in the Pacific time zone, you get:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>This is a bit different from what you posted.  Yours seems to indicate 8 AM, not 8 PM.</p>

<p>Also, the <code>components:fromDate:toDate:options:</code> is going to count <em>whole</em> units.  Thus, if you're asking for the number of days, it's going to say there are 2 whole days in between them, which there are.</p>

<p>Perhaps a better way to do what you're looking for is this:</p>

<pre><code>NSUInteger startOrdinal = [cal ordinalityOfUnit:NSDayCalendarUnit inUnit:NSYearCalendarUnit forDate:startDate];
NSUInteger stopOrdinal = [cal ordinalityOfUnit:NSDayCalendarUnit inUnit:NSYearCalendarUnit forDate:stopDate];
</code></pre>

<p>Then the number of days between them will be <code>(stopOrdinal - startOrdinal)</code>.  In the case of your dates, this yields 3 (April 1 GMT - April 3 GMT).  If you really really want to ignore the time portion, you're going to have to figure out how to chop off the time portion of the dates within the target timezone.  This will involve converting the dates into <code>NSDateComponent</code> objects, then setting the <code>-hour</code>, <code>-minute</code>, and <code>-second</code> portions to 0.  Once you've done that, you can change them back into <code>NSDates</code>, and then go on with your difference calculations.</p>

"<p>I want to write the value of a NSDate into a NSTextField but I don't want to format the NSDate into NSString first. The user interface already has an NSDateFormatter object in place and place and it worked fine already when the field was bound to the NSDate. </p>

<p>But now we can't use binding anymore and need to set the Textfield value manually. But we still want to use the NSDateFormatter.</p>

<p>For me it seems like this can not be done. All the samples I found convert the NSDate into a string first before sending it to the TextField. Also if I do it like that I need to convert back the date after the user entered a new value.</p>

<p>How can I do this? </p>
","115730","","<p>I believe you can use <code>-setObjectValue:</code> (declared on <code>NSControl</code>) to have the <code>NSDate</code> be routed through the attached formatter.</p>

<p>Similarly, the <code>-objectValue</code> method should convert the displayed string back into an <code>NSDate</code> and return that.</p>
"
"<p>Here is my situation. It's complicated so bear with me.</p>

<p>I have a view class, let's call it <code>MyView</code>. It creates a loading indicator subview, and then starts a background operation that will load data. It also creates a block that the background queue operation will enqueue on the main queue when it's done. The block prepares the view by adding another subview, a <code>UITextView</code>, with the loaded data. Of course, to do that, the block has to have a reference to the view.</p>

<p>So the background operation retains the block, and the block retains the view. With me so far?</p>

<p>Sometimes the instance of <code>MyView</code> is removed from its superview before the background queue operation is finished. And sometimes the main queue operation, which calls the block, gets completely cleaned up before the background queue operation gets completely cleaned up. In this case, the instance of <code>MyView</code> can get its <code>-dealloc</code> call on the background thread, because the last reference to the view belonged to the block, and the last reference to the block belonged to the background operation.</p>

<p>UIKit doesn't like to be called from any thread but the main thread. In the case of <code>UITextView</code>, apparently that even includes <code>-dealloc</code> calls. I get <code>EXC_BAD_ACCESS</code> from something called the ""web thread lock"" during the <code>-dealloc</code> of the text view.</p>

<p>I think it's reasonable for the background thread to have the last reference sometimes, and I would like to handle this from within my <code>-dealloc</code> implementation, like so:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)dealloc {
    if ([NSOperationQueue currentQueue] == [NSOperationQueue mainQueue]) {
        // The usual -- dealloc subviews safely on the main thread
        self.myIvar = nil;
        [super dealloc];
    }
    else {
        // Not on the main thread, so keep the object alive
        // in spite of the dealloc call.
        [self retain];                   // explicit retain
        [[NSOperationQueue mainQueue]
         addOperationWithBlock:^{        // implicit retain at block creation
            [self release];              // explicit release
        }];                              // implicit release, dealloc called again, but on the main thread
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So when you call <code>-release</code> on an object, the implementation in <code>NSObject</code> calls <code>-dealloc</code> if the retain count reaches zero. Is that all that happens? In other words, is it OK to get a call to <code>-dealloc</code> and <em>not</em> call <code>super</code>? Am I making some kind of abominable zombie object or is this fine?</p>

<p>If this is not OK, what is a good way to make sure <code>-dealloc</code> gets called on the main thread?</p>
","115730","","<p>Ive seen this approach used:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)dealloc {
  if (is on main thread) {
    [self _reallyDealloc];
  } else {
    [self performSelectorOnMainThread:@selector(_reallyDealloc)];
  }
}

- (void)_reallyDealloc {
  [ivar release];
  [super dealloc]
}
</code></pre>

<p>This still isn't ideal (and breaks in ARC). The best answer is to guarantee that the final release happens on the main thread. </p>

<p>and reference <code>b</code> and <code>c</code> in a block, is the block retain <code>self</code> automatically? Or just <code>b</code> and <code>c</code>? About <code>c</code>, it may be retained itself, but how about <code>b</code>?</p>
","115730","","<p>Bill's answer isn't quite correct:</p>

<p>If you have an instance of <code>A</code> and create a block inside of that instance like so:</p>

<pre><code>^{
  b = YES;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then <code>self</code> is retained (when the block is copied).  <code>b</code> is <em>not</em> <code>const</code>-copied, because <code>b</code> is strongly referenced by <code>self</code>, and only <code>self</code> is <code>const</code> within the scope of the block.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you do:</p>

<pre><code>BOOL aBool = YES;
^{
  aBool = NO;
  c = [[NSObject alloc] init];

<p>Then again, <code>self</code> is <code>const</code>-copied (and retained when the block itself is copied) and the assignment to <code>c</code> is allowed.  However, the assignment to <code>aBOOL</code> is <em>not</em> allowed, because the value of <code>aBool</code> is <code>const</code>-copied.</p>

<p>In other words, the compiler recognizes the <code>b</code> and <code>c</code> are ivars, and will retain <code>self</code> instead of the ivars directly.</p>

<hr>

<p>One way to think about this that helps me understand what's going on is to remember that an object is really just a fancy struct, which means you can technically access ivars via the arrow operator:  <code>-&gt;</code></p>

<p>So when you're accessing ivars:</p>

<pre><code>b = YES;
</code></pre>

<p>is <em>equivalent</em> to:</p>

<pre><code>self-&gt;b = YES;
</code></pre>

<p>In that light, it makes perfect sense <em>why</em> you have to retain <code>self</code>, but <code>b</code> is not <code>const</code>.  It's because <code>b</code> is only a slim part of the ""bigger picture"", and in order to get <code>b</code>, you must necessarily include all of <code>self</code> as well (since copying part of a struct doesn't really make sense in this context).</p>

","115730","","<p>So you know <em>how</em> to get around your problem, but here's <em>why</em> you have to do so and one of the reasons why dot syntax in Objective-C is an unholy perversion:</p>

<p><code>anInstance.property = blah</code> is compiled to the exact same code that would be generated if you had instead typed: <code>[anInstance setProperty:blah]</code></p>

<p>This works fine if your properties are only object properties.  Unfortunately for us, dot syntax already has an unrelated meaning in C, and that's to access members of a struct.  ie, you can do:</p>

<pre><code>NSRect foo;
foo.origin.x = 42;
</code></pre>

<p>If <code>foo</code> were an object, then <code>foo.origin.x = 42</code> would be the same as <code>[[foo origin] setX:42]</code> (assuming <code>origin</code> were also an object).  However, since they're simply structs, it's just doing an offset calculation and setting the value in memory directly.  There's no method invocation going on.</p>

<p>Enter dot syntax in Objective-C.  Now we have two different meanings of the dot operator (something that not even C++ allows, ironically enough, with all of its operator overloading).  Sometimes you're using it to access a struct member.  Sometimes you're using it to invoke an object accessor.  Sometimes you can mix-and-match those uses.  Sometimes you can't.</p>

<p>You can mix-and-match member vs accessor access if the expression is being used as an rvalue.  In other words, you can do:</p>

<pre><code>foo = anObject.frame.origin.x;
</code></pre>

<p>However, if you try to do this as an lvalue, it fails:</p>

<pre><code>anObject.frame.origin.x = foo;
</code></pre>

<p>The way to work around this is to do:</p>

<pre><code>NSRect frame = anObject.frame;
frame.origin.x = 42;
anObject.frame = frame;
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, if you just forgot that dot syntax existed altogether, then you'd never have this problem, because trying to coming up with a way to do this using bracket syntax would be non-sensical.</p>

<p>And this is one of the many reason why I think dot syntax was a terrible mistake.  You <em>never</em> would've been confused about this if it had never been added.</p>

<p>I have tried to override <code>setValue:ForKey:</code> and <code>valueForKey:</code>, but those aren't called, they allow you to directly set properties without using the property syntax.</p>

<p>I have made preprocessor macros to make this work in the past, but I am not interested in typing at all, and would like to avoid as much of it as I can in the future. Is there a way to make this work that I am not familiar with?</p>

<p>I have thought about using NSManagedObject, but I am not sure if I can get what I want out of that.

"<p>This seems like it may be a trivial question, but I am new to Core Data and to databases.</p>

<p>In my application, I perform a fetch and display the results.  Then, based on user input, I need to cull those results down.  That is, I need to do a new search on only the results of the first fetch, but based on an entirely different parameter.  (Sometimes, the second fetch will be based on an attribute, other times on a to-many relationship.)  What is the optimal way to do this?</p>

<p>I have figured out two options to do this, but neither seems very good:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>In the first fetch, prefetch all the data needed for the second fetch.  Then, don't do a second fetch, but just iterate through the array of results of the first fetch, looking for matches to the new conditions of the second fetch.  <em>This method has the disadvantage that I have to trudge thru the array and don't take advantage of performance benefits of Core Data.</em></p></li>
<li><p>For the second fetch, disregard the first and do a brand new fetch with a compound predicate composed of the conditions for the first fetch and those for the second.  <em>This has the disadvantage that Core Data must look thru the entire database again to do the same search it already did.</em></p></li>
</ol>

<p>Is there a way, in a second fetch, to tell Core Data to search only thru the entity objects returned in an earlier fetch?</p>
","115730","","<p>You've pretty much got it figured out.</p>

<p>For the first option, it's pretty easy.  You have your array of objects, and you can just do <code>-[NSArray filteredArrayUsingPredicate:]</code> or <code>-[NSMutableArray filterUsingPredicate:]</code> to reduce the array according to your needs.  You don't need to actually iterate through the array yourself; just use a predicate like you would with a fetch request.</p>

<p>For the second option, that's also pretty easy.  You take the predicate from your first request and <code>AND</code> it with your new predicate:</p>

<pre><code>NSPredicate *original = ...;
NSPredicate *newCondition = ...;
NSPredicate *newFilter = [NSCompoundPredicate andPredicateWithSubpredicates:[NSArray arrayWithObjects:original, newCondition, nil]];

"<p>I've written a small utility program that identifies duplicate tracks in iTunes. 
The actual matching of tracks takes a long time, and I'd like to optimize it.
I am storing track data in an NSMutableDictionary that stores individual track data in
NSMutableDictionaries keyed by trackID. These individual track dictionaries have 
at least the following keys:</p>

<ul>
<li>TrackID</li>
<li>Name</li>
<li>Artist</li>
<li>Duration (in milli ####.####)</li>
</ul>

<p>To determine if any tracks match one another, I must check:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the duration of two tracks are within 5 seconds of each other</li>
<li>Name matches</li>
<li>Artist matches</li>
</ul>

<p>The slow way for me to do it is using two for-loops:</p>

<pre><code>-(void)findDuplicateTracks {

    NSArray *allTracks = [tracks allValues];

    BOOL isMatch = NO;

    int numMatches = 0;

    // outer loop

    NSMutableDictionary *track      = nil;
    NSMutableDictionary *otherTrack = nil;

            // already appeared in i

<p>This becomes quite slow for large music libraries, and only uses 1
processor.  One recommended optimization was to use blocks and process
the tracks in batches (of 100 tracks). I tried that.  If my code
originally took 9 hours to run, it now takes about 2 hours on a
quad-core. That's still too slow. But (talking above my pay grade here)
perhaps there is a way to store all the values I need in a C structure that ""fits on the stack"" and then I wouldn't have to fetch the values from slower memory. This seems too low-level for me, but I'm willing to learn if I had an example.</p>

<p>BTW, I profiled this in Instruments and <code>[NSCFSet member:]</code> takes up
86.6% percent of the CPU time. </p>

<p>Then I thought I should extract all the durations into a sorted array so I would not have
to look up the duration value in the dictionary. I think that is a good
idea, but when I started to implement it, I wondered how to determine
the best batch size. </p>

<p>If I have the following durations:</p>

<pre><code>    2 2 3 4 5 6 6 16 17 38 59   Duration
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6  7  8  9 10   Index
</code></pre>

<p>Then just by iterating over the array, I know that to find matching
tracks of the song at index 0, I only need to compare it against songs
up to index 6. That's great, I have my first batch. But now I have to
start over at index 1 only to find that it's batch should also stop at
index 6 and exclude index 0. I'm assuming I'm wasting a lot of
processing cycles here determining what the batch should be/the duration
matches.  This seemed like a ""set"" problem, but we didn't do much of
that in my Intro to Algorithms class.   </p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<p>1) What is the most efficient way to identify matching tracks? Is it
something similar to what's above? Is it using disjoint and [unified]
set operations that are slightly above my knowledge level? Is it
filtering arrays using NSArray? Is there an online resource that
describes this problem and solution?</p>

<p>I am willing to restructure the tracks dictionary in whatever way
(datastructure) is most efficient. I had at first thought I needed to
perform many lookups by TrackID, but that is no longer the case.</p>

<p>2) Is there a more efficient way to approach this problem? How do you
rock stars go from paragraph 1 to an optimized solution?</p>

<p>I have searched for the answer, longer than I care to admit, and found
these interesting, but unhelpful answers:</p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4373588/find-duplicates/4373719#4373719"">find duplicates</a></p>

<p>Thanks for any help you can provide,
Lance</p>
","115730","","<p>There are several ways to do this, but here's my first naïve guess:</p>

<p>Have a mutable dictionary.
The keys in this dictionary are the names of the songs.
The value of each key is another mutable dictionary.
The keys of this secondary mutable dictionary are the artists.
The value of each key is a mutable array of songs.</p>

<p>You'd end up with something like this:</p>

<pre><code>NSArray *songs = ...; //your array of songs
NSMutableDictionary *nameCache = [NSMutableDictionary dictionary];

for (Song *song in songs) {
  NSString *name = [song name];
  NSMutableDictionary *artistCache = [nameCache objectForKey:name];
  if (artistCache == nil) {
    artistCache = [NSMutableDictionary dictionary];
    [nameCache setObject:artistCache forKey:name];
  }

  NSString *artist = [song artist];
  NSMutableArray *songCache = [artistCache objectForKey:artist];
  if (songCache == nil) {
    songCache = [NSMutableArray array];
    [artistCache setObject:songCache forKey:artist];
  }

  for (Song *otherSong in songCache) {
    //these are songs that have the same name and artist
    NSTimeInterval myDuration = [song duration];
    NSTimeInterval otherDuration = [otherSong duration];
    if (fabs(myDuration - otherDuration) &lt; 5.0f) {
      //name matches, artist matches, and their difference in duration is less than 5 seconds
    }
  }
  [songCache addObject:song];
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is a worst-case O(n<sup>2</sup>) algorithm (if every song has the same name, artist, and duration).  It's a best-case O(n) algorithm (if every song has a different name/artist/duration), and will realistically end up being closer to O(n) than to O(n<sup>2</sup>) (most likely).</p>

"<p>I see this in the predicate programming guide:</p>

<p>If you use a to-many relationship, the construction of a predicate is slightly different. If you want to fetch Departments in which at least one of the employees has the first name ""Matthew,"" for instance, you use an ANY operator as shown in the following example:</p>

<pre><code>NSPredicate *predicate = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:
    @""ANY employees.firstName like 'Matthew'""];
</code></pre>

<p>With the above construction, it would return the department with all employees objects associated to it, provided at least one of the employees have first name as 'Matthew'.</p>

<p>I would like to modify this to fetch ONLY those employees with first name as 'Matthew'.
So if the department has only 2 employees matching this first name, only 2 employee objects should be returned.</p>

<p>How can I achieve this?
thanks.</p>
","115730","","<p>You're executing this agains a set of <code>Department</code> objects, so you can only get back <code>Department</code> objects.  If you want <code>Employee</code> objects instead, you'd have to do something like this:</p>

NSArray *employees = [aDepartment employees];
NSPredicate *filter = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@""firstName = 'Matthew'""];
NSArray *matthews = [employees filteredArrayUsingPredicate:filter];

"<p>I am trying to write some dynamic code where a user can try calling a method from a specific instance of a class and have it be resolved at runtime. The implementation to retrieve the information exists but the method to access it does not because it is on a per instance basis.</p>

<p>For example, a user may want to call a method named ""getSomething"" which doesn't exist in the class:</p>

<pre><code>[someInstance getSomething]
</code></pre>

<p>In this situation, I want to have an implementation resolved which has a variable return type that will only apply to the instance being worked on. I was considering using <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Reference/ObjCRuntimeRef/Reference/reference.html#//apple_ref/c/func/class_addMethod"">class_addMethod</a> from the Objective-C but I am not 100% sure of its behavior. On the documentation it claims that this can be used to add class or instance methods. Does calling this class add the method to only the specific instance or to the class so that every instance created afterward will have the method on it? I also read that once a method is added you can't remove it.</p>

<p>Perhaps my approach isn't correct so if any alternatives are known I would appreciate it. I cannot use message forwarding because there is no class that understands the selector already implemented.</p>
","115730","","<p>Another way you could do this is with a dynamic subclass:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)addCustomMethodToObject:(id)object {
  Class objectClass = object_getClass(object);
  SEL selectorToOverride = ...; // this is the method name you want to override

  NSString *newClassName = [NSString stringWithFormat:@""Custom_%@"", NSStringFromClass(objectClass)];
  Class c = NSClassFromString(newClassName);
  if (c == nil) {
    // this class doesn't exist; create it
    // allocate a new class
    c = objc_allocateClassPair(objectClass, [newClassName UTF8String], 0);
    // get the info on the method we're going to override
    Method m = class_getInstanceMethod(objectClass, selectorToOverride);
    // add the method to the new class
    class_addMethod(c, selectorToOverride, (IMP)myCustomFunction, method_getTypeEncoding(m));
    // register the new class with the runtime
    objc_registerClassPair(c);
  }
  // change the class of the object
  object_setClass(object, c);
}

id myCustomFunction(id self, SEL _cmd, [other params...]) {
  // this is the body of the instance-specific method
  // you may call super to invoke the original implementation
}
</code></pre>

<p>After doing this, only <code>object</code> will have received the overridden method, because it will be the only thing that's an instance of the special class.  Also, this code only overrides instance methods, but it wouldn't be hard to modify it to override class methods.</p>

<p>As always, the usual warnings:</p>

<ol>

<li><em>Caveat Observer</em>: this code does not play well with key-value observing</li>

<li><em>Caveat ARC'er</em>: <code>objc_allocateClassPair()</code> cannot be compiled with ARC.</li>
<li><em>Caveat Developer</em>: mucking around with an object's class is a dangerous thing. There are perfectly legitimate uses for this sort of voodoo, but they are <em>very</em> rare.

","115730","","<p>The proper way to get human readable strings in the predicate editor's row views is to use the localization capabilities of <code>NSRuleEditor</code> and <code>NSPredicateEditor</code>.</p>

<p>If you follow the instructions in <a href=""http://tumblr.com/xqooiw0ue"" rel=""nofollow"">this blog post</a>, you'll have everything you need to localize the editor.</p>

<p>As an example, let's say your key path is <code>fileName</code>, you support 2 operators (<code>is</code> and <code>contains</code>), and you want the user to enter a string.  You'll end up with a strings file that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>""%[fileName]@ %[is]@ %@"" = ""%1$[fileName]@ %2$[is]@ %3$@"";
""%[fileName]@ %[contains]@ %@"" = ""%1$[fileName]@ %2$[contains]@ %3$@"";
</code></pre>

<p>You can use this file to put in human-readable stuff, and even reorder things:</p>

<pre><code>""%[fileName]@ %[is]@ %@"" = ""%1$[original filename]@ %2$[is]@ %3$@"";
""%[fileName]@ %[contains]@ %@"" = ""%3$@ %2$[is contained in]@ %1$[original filename]@"";
</code></pre>

<p>Once you've localized the strings file, you hand that file back to the predicate editor, and it'll pull out the translated values, do its magic, and everything will show up correctly.</p>

"<p>I have <strong>Client</strong> entities and <strong>Job</strong> entities. </p>

<p>Each job can have one client. The relationship for the jobs of a client (client&lt;-->>job) is called jobOfClient.</p>

<p>Each client can have many jobs. The relationship for client of a job (job&lt;&lt;-->client) is called clientOfJob.</p>

<p>(Of course, these are inverse relationships.)</p>

<p>Here, I sort through jobs, looking for jobs that aren't related to any client: </p>

<pre><code>NSEntityDescription * entity = [NSEntityDescription entityForName:@""Job"" inManagedObjectContext:dataInterface.managedObjectContext];

NSPredicate *predicate = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat: @""clientOfJob == nil""];
</code></pre>

NSPredicate *predicate = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat: @""clientOfJob == %@"", userState.selectedClient];
</code></pre>

<p>But this next one doesn't work. Here I sort through clients, looking for the one client associated with a selected job (or return no result if there is no related client, but that's not the case here).</p>

<pre><code>NSEntityDescription * entity = [NSEntityDescription entityForName:@""Client"" inManagedObjectContext:dataInterface.managedObjectContext];

<p>There must be something subtle here that I don't understand. Can someone help me with **the info I have given?</p>
","115730","","<p><code>jobOfClient</code> will return a collection of objects, which means your predicate is essentially doing:</p>

<pre><code>NSSet *jobs = [thisObject jobOfClient];
return ([jobs isEqual:aJob]);
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously, a collection is never equal to a single value, and so CoreData does not recognize the predicate.  To get around this, I think you can do:</p>

<pre><code>[NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@""jobOfClient CONTAINS %@"", [userState selectedJob]];
</code></pre>

<p>And to make sure you don't run into this again, I would recommend changing the name of this relationship from <code>jobOfClient</code> to just <code>jobs</code> (using the plural form to indicate it's a to-many relationship, and eliminating the <code>OfClient</code>, because it's already on the <code>Client</code> entity).  Your other relationships should probably be similarly renamed.  <code>clientOfJob</code> => <code>client</code>, etc.</p>

"<p>I am trying to get an URL from a simple NSString sentence. For that I use NSDataDetector in the following code:</p>

<pre><code>NSString *string = @""This is a sample of a http://abc.com/efg.php?EFAei687e3EsA sentence with a URL within it and a number 097843.""; 
NSDataDetector *linkDetector = [NSDataDetector dataDetectorWithTypes:NSTextCheckingTypeLink error:nil];

    NSLog(@""found URL: %@"", matchingString);

<p>The result is that it finds the URL and the number. The number is detected as a phone-Number:</p>

<pre><code>found URL: http://abc.com/efg.php?EFAei687e3EsA
found URL: tel:097843
</code></pre>

<p>Is that a bug? Could anyone tell me how to get the URL without that telephone number?</p>
","115730","","<p><code>NSDataDetector</code> necessarily detects telephone numbers as links because on the phone, you can tap them as if they were a link in order to initiate a phone call (or tap and hold to initiate a text message, etc).  I believe that the current locale (ie, <code>NSLocale</code>) is what determines whether a string of numbers looks like a phone number or not.  For example, in the United States, it would take at least seven digits to be recognized as a phone number, since numbers in the US are of the general form: <code>\d{3}-\d{4}</code>.</p>

<p>As for recognizing a telephone link versus another link, it's not a good idea to check for <code>http://</code> at the beginning of the URL.  A simple example suffices: what if it's an <code>https://</code> link?  Then your code breaks.</p>

<p>The better way to check this would be like this:</p>

","115730","","<p>Yes you can, but you need to modify the format string slightly.</p>

<p>Instead of doing:</p>

<p>You'd need to do:</p>

<pre><code>[preds appendFormat:@"" (attending = '%@')"", prov];

<p>However, even if you go this route, you're still stuck using <code>predicateWithFormat:</code>, which you appear to want to avoid.  You'll also likely have issues with how you're using <code>NSNull</code> in the format string.</p>

<p>I would recommend doing something more like this:</p>

"<p>I have class Item and class List (which has an NSMutableArray).</p>

<p>Every time class Item is instantiated (and destroyed) it posts a notification, which is listened-to by class List.  When class List receives the notification is adds the instance of class Item to its list.</p>

<p>I'm trying to have class Item also post a notification that its about to be dealloc'd.  The problem is that class List's NSMutableArray retains the instance of class Item.</p>

<p>What's the most appropriate means of handling this situation?  If I decrement the count when adding it to List's array, then an exception will be thrown when class List attempts to call removeObject (since it'll try to dealloc the object.)</p>

<p>Basically, I want a ""monitor"" class List that contains a list of all ""live"" instances of Item.  But, I also need the ability to release/dealloc the instances and have them report they're being dealloc'd so List can remove them from its NSMutableArray.</p>

<p>Thanks for your help.</p>
","115730","","<p>If I understand correctly, you want an array that maintains weak references to its items, as opposed to strong references?</p>

<p><strike>I don't know of a way to do this with anything ""built-in"" in Cocoa.  The only way I'd know of to do this is to make the array yourself, and have the storage be <code>__weak id[]</code>.  That would automatically zero-out the place in the array when the object deallocates.  If you're under the retain-release model, you could use something like <a href=""https://github.com/mikeash/MAZeroingWeakRef""><code>MAZeroingWeakRef</code></a> to get the same behavior.</p>

<p>This is definitely an interesting question, and I don't know of an easier answer.  I'd love to be proven wrong!</strike></p>

<p>Ha, I love being wrong!</p>

<p>There's a class called <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSPointerArray_Class/Introduction/Introduction.html""><code>NSPointerArray</code></a> that looks like it can do what you're looking for.  However, it's only available on the Mac, and it only auto-zeros when you're using garbage collection.</p>

<p>I'll keep thinking about this.  This is an interesting problem! :)</p>

<hr>

<p>So I kept thinking about this, and came up with a solution.  It uses two unconventional things:</p>

<ol>
<li>A subclass of <code>NSMutableArray</code> (egads!)</li>
<li>Using an associated object to determine object deallocation</li>
</ol>

<p>For the first bit, I had to to subclass <code>NSMutableArray</code> so that I could inject some custom logic into <code>addObject:</code> (and related methods).  I didn't want to do this via swizzling, since <code>NSArray</code> and friends are a class cluster, and swizzling into/out of clusters is fraught with peril.  So, a subclass.  This is fine, but we're going to lose some of the awesome features we get from ""pure"" <code>NSArray</code> instances, like <a href=""http://ridiculousfish.com/blog/archives/2005/12/23/array/"">how they do weird things when they get big</a>.  Oh well, such is life.</p>

<p>As for the second bit, I needed a way for any arbitrary object to notify that it is about to or just finished deallocating.  I thought of dynamically subclassing the object's class, injecting my own <code>dealloc</code>/<code>finalize</code> method, calling <code>super</code>, and then smashing the <code>isa</code> of the object, but that just seemed a little too crazy.</p>

<p>So, I decided to take advantage of a fun little thing called associated objects.  These are to ivars what categories are to classes: they allow you to dynamically add and remove pseudo-instance variables at runtime.  They also have the awesome side effect of getting automatically cleaned up with the object deallocates.  So what I did is just created a little throw away object that posts a notification when <em>it</em> is deallocated, and then attached it to the regular object.  That way when the regular object is deallocated, the throw away object will be as well, resulting in a notification being posted, which I then listen for in the <code>NSMutableArray</code> subclass.  The notification contains a (stale) pointer to the object that is in the process of getting destroyed, but since I only care about the <em>pointer</em> and not the <em>object</em>, that's OK.</p>

<p>The upshot of all of this is that you can do:</p>

<pre><code>DDAutozeroingArray *array = [DDAutozeroingArray array];

NSObject *o = [[NSObject alloc] init];
[array addObject:o];
NSLog(@""%ld"", [array count]); //logs ""1""
[o release];
NSLog(@""%ld"", [array count]); //logs ""0""
</code></pre>

<p>The source is on github, and it should (theoretically) work just as well on iOS as Mac OS X (regardless of GC mode): <a href=""https://github.com/davedelong/Demos"">https://github.com/davedelong/Demos</a></p>

<p>Cheers!</p>

<hr>

<p>... and I just thought of a way to do this without a custom subclass, but I'm tired and will post the updated answer tomorrow.</p>

<hr>

<p><em>the next morning...</em></p>

<p>I've just updated the project on Github with an <code>NSMutableArray</code> category that allows you to create a true <code>NSMutableArray</code> that auto-zeroes its objects as they're deallocated.  The trick was to create a <code>CFMutableArrayRef</code> with a custom <code>retain</code> callback that sets up the proper observation, and then just cast that <code>CFMutableArrayRef</code> to an <code>NSMutableArray</code> and use that (ah, the magic of Toll-Free Bridging).</p>

<p>This means you can now do:</p>

<pre><code>NSMutableArray *array = [NSMutableArray autozeroingArray];
</code></pre>

<p>I added a <code>typedef</code> to define these as <code>NSAutozeroingMutableArray</code>, just to make it explicitly clear that while this is an <code>NSMutableArray</code>, it doesn't <code>retain</code> its objects like a normal <code>NSMutableArray</code>.  However, since it's just a <code>typedef</code> and not a subclass, you can use them interchangeably.</p>

"<p>I'm creating an NSPredicateEditor in code and trying to achieve what I had hoped would be a fairly simple task. Basically, I would like to display a compound NSPredicateEditorRowTemplate (giving the user the option to perform matches when ""All/Any/None of the following are true"") and a number of fairly basic subrows beneath it. To do this, I construct my NSPredicateEditor and bind its value in order to save changes as the user edits their predicate.</p>

<p>The issue I'm experiencing is that, no matter what, I cannot make a compound NSPredicateEditorRowTemplate show by default as the parent row with a single subrow. When I create the predicate initially I pass a bogus empty predicate, like so:</p>

<pre><code>filename BEGINSWITH[cd] ''
</code></pre>

<p>In order to force the display of a compound row I have to create two subrows:</p>

","115730","","<p>The problem is that you're giving it a comparison predicate.  You need to give it a compound one.</p>

<p>I'm guessing that your <code>SIPredicateStringValueTransformer</code> object is taking a string and turning it into a predicate, right?  And it's probably doing something like this:</p>

<pre><code>- (id) transformedValue:(id)value {
  return [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:value];
}
</code></pre>

<p>What you want to do instead is guarantee that the value transformer doesn't just return any old predicate, but rather a <em>compound</em> predicate (ie an <code>NSCompoundPredicate</code> instead of an <code>NSComparisonPredicate</code>).  The way to do that is quite simple:</p>

<pre><code>- (id) transformedValue:(id)value {
  NSPredicate *p = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:value];
  if ([p isKindOfClass:[NSComparisonPredicate class]]) {
    p = [NSCompoundPredicate andPredicateWithSubpredicates:[NSArray arrayWithObject:p]];
  }
  return p;
}

<p>When you give an <code>NSCompoundPredicate</code> to the predicate editor, it displays the compound row.  When you only give a comparison predicate, it only displays the appropriate comparison row.</p>

","115730","","<p>You should <strong>not</strong> release <code>myCrib</code> if you are not the owner.  To do so is a violation of the memory management guidelines and will make your code extremely difficult to maintain.  I cannot stress enough that you <strong>absolutely should never do this under any sort of circumstance.</strong>  You're asking for crashes; the array has declared ownership of the object, and you <strong>must not</strong> subvert that ownership in any way.</p>

<p>So the answer here is: your code is <strong>absolutely wrong</strong> and you should fix it.  If you can't fix it, you should trash it and start over and keep rewriting it until you've come up with another way to achieve the same effect without subverting object ownership.  I <strong>guarantee</strong> that it's possible.</p>

<p>If what you want is a weak-referencing array, then there are a couple ways you can do this (this <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/q/5972808/115730"">was just asked a couple of days ago</a>):</p>

<ol>
<li><code>NSPointerArray</code> - weakly references its pointers.  When you use garbage collection, they're autozeroing (ie, the pointers get removed when the object is deallocated). Unfortunately, this is not available on iOS.</li>
<li><code>CFMutableArrayRef</code> - you can specify a custom <code>retain</code> and <code>release</code> callback, or just not specify one at all.  If you leave them out, the array will simply not retain the objects it contains.  However, this does not automatically remove the pointer when the object is deallocated.</li>
<li><code>DDAutozeroingArray</code> - an <code>NSMutableArray</code> subclass I wrote the other day to provide a weakly-referencing and auto-zeroing array that works on both Mac OS and iOS.  However, I <strong>strongly</strong> encourage you to use this only as a last resort; There are probably much better ways of doing what you're looking for.  <a href=""https://github.com/davedelong/Demos"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/davedelong/Demos</a></li>

"<p>I'm trying to have a Table View displaying the content of a generic SQLite table.
The user selects a SQLite file at runtime (I cannot know its structure at design-time). I am then able to extract a list of all the tables available in the db, along with their structures (the fields and field-types in each table) and data.
Now… How do I show them in a Table View?</p>

<p>I really appreciate Core Data, so I'm trying to use this framework.
I can import all the SQLite db in a ""static"" general purpose Core Data model. It has three entities: Table, Field and Value.</p>

<p>Each table object has a to-many relationship with its fields. 
Each field has a to-many relationship with the values it has for each row in the table.</p>

<p>I know this looks weird (and I gladly accept radically alternative suggestions), but it works: I can import all the SQLite db data in a Core Data model, no matter how the db is structured.</p>

<p>In order to present the data from a table to the user, however, I should ""recompact"" all data from fields and values related to the table in a single table view, where a column is required for each field (let alone formatting now, but if this works I should be able to pass all formatting issues to NSFormatter). 
How can I achieve this?
In other words: how do I programmatically create columns in a table view and bind them to a dynamically created array controller?</p>
","115730","","<p>If you want to know a list of all the tables in a SQLite database, you can execute:</p>

","115730","","<p>No, because you're misunderstanding how view controllers work.  View controllers control a view.  That's it.  While a view may <em>usually</em> take up the entire screen, it doesn't have to.

There's the <code>UISplitViewController</code> and it's main content area, there's the <code>UIViewController</code> controlling the left (""master"") area of the split view controller, another <code>UIViewController</code> controller the right (""detail"") area of the split view controller, and a fourth view controller for controlling the contents of the popover.</p>

"<p>I'm attaching object B via associative reference to object A.  Object B observes some properties of object A through KVO.</p>

<p>You can take a strings file and load it into an <code>NSString</code>, and then transform it into a dictionary using <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSString_Class/Reference/NSString.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000154-propertyListFromStringsFileFormat""><code>-[NSString propertyListFromStringsFileFormat]</code></a>.</p>

<p>This will provide you with a way to store your custom-translated strings in-memory.</p>

<p>As for actually using that, you'll have to define custom translation functions.  IE, you can't use <code>NSLocalizedString()</code> and friends any more.  Fortunately, <code>genstrings</code> (the utility used for generating strings files) lets you specify <a href=""http://www.manpagez.com/man/1/genstrings/"">custom function names</a>:</p>

<pre><code>genstrings -s ""JPLocalizedString"" ...
</code></pre>

<p>This means that in code, you can define:</p>

<pre><code>NSString* JPLocalizedString(NSString *key, NSString *comment) {
  return [myLoadedStrings objectForKey:key];
}
</code></pre>

<p>As well as <code>JPLocalizedStringFromTable()</code>, <code>JPLocalizedStringFromTableInBundle()</code>, <code>JPLocalizedStringWithDefaultValue()</code>.  <code>genstrings</code> will pick up all of those.  (In other words, just because <code>NSLocalizedString</code> is a macro doesn't mean your version has to be)</p>

<p>If you do this and use these <code>JPLocalizedString</code> variants, then <code>genstrings</code> will still generate your strings files for you (providing you use the <code>-s</code> flag).</p>

<p>Once these functions are called, you can use whatever lookup mechanism you want, defaulting back to the <code>NSLocalizedString</code> versions if you can't find anything.</p>

"<p>In UIKit, UIControl has the following methods:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>addTarget:action:forControlEvents:</code></li>
<li><code>removeTarget:action:forControlEvents:</code></li>
</ul>

<p>I am interested to know how these are programmed. Could someone point to a resource of how these methods are programmed (or provide an example how these are programmed)?</p>

<p><em>I have implemented something similar for my own project that is working. However it would be great to know the best technique to go about this, or how Apple have implemented it, as it is a useful pattern. (And, if I am correct, differs from a delegate pattern?).</em></p>
","115730","","<p>It's pretty simple.  Here's one way you could imagine it working:</p>

<pre><code>@interface UIControlTargetActionPair
@property (nonatomic, assign) id target;
@property (nonatomic, assign) SEL action
@end
</code></pre>

<p>(with an <code>@implementation</code> to just synthesize those properties)</p>

<p>Then:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)addTarget:(id)target action:(SEL)action forControlEvents:(UIControlEvents)events {
  if (events &amp; UIControlEventTouchDown) {
    UIControlTargetActionPair *pair = [[UIControlTargetActionPair alloc] init];
    [pair setTarget:target];
    [pair setAction:action];
    [[self mutableArrayOfTargetActionPairsForControlEvent:UIControlEventTouchDown] addObject:pair];
    [pair release];
  }
  else if (....) {
    ...
  }
  // repeat for all relevant control events
}
</code></pre>

<p>Removal would be to simply remote the pair object from the appropriate array, and sending the events would simply be something like this:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)sendActionsForControlEvents:(UIControlEvents)controlEvents {
  NSArray *pairs = [self mutableArrayOfTargetActionPairsForControlEvent:controlEvents];
  for (UIControlTargetActionPair *pair in pairs) {
    [[pair target] performSelector:[pair action] withObject:self withObject:theCurrentEvent];
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, that's not the actual code.  But having the code here in front of me, it is the general principle.  :)</p>

","115730","","<p>It is unnecessary to have a second autorelease pool in the <code>getArray</code> method.  </p>

Yes you can specify sort descriptors to a fetch request, but those aren't applied until after the predicate is used.  Any data that gets processed by the predicate is inherently unordered.  So asking for an ""array index value"" to use in a predicate for CoreData would not only be an abuse of the predicate system, but represents an inherent misunderstanding about the CoreData framework.</p>

<p>So you can see I have three keypaths and some constants they can be compared with.
When analyzing the string I basically want to do this, in pseudocode:</p>

<pre><code>originalString = [string from NSTextView]
for (char in originalString)
    bChar = [character before char]
    aChar = [character after char]

    predicate = [predicate from myPredicateEditor]

    // using predicate - problem!
    result = [evaluate predicate with:
               bChar somehow 'linked' to keypath 'Character Before'
               char 'linked' to 'Character'
               aChar 'linked' to 'Character After' // These values change, of course
              and also:
               constant ""All letters"" as ""abc...WXYZ""
               constant ""Numbers"" as ""0123456789""
               etc for all other constants set up  // These don't
              ]

    if (result) then do something with char, bChar and aChar
</code></pre>

<p>You can see where my problem basically lies:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>'Character Before/After' cannot be keypaths because of the space, but I want to keep it that way as it is more beautiful for the user (imagine having something as 'characterBefore' instead...)</p></li>
<li><p>Constants such as 'Numbers' actually represent strings like '0123456789', witch I can't display to the user as well</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I was able to find a workaround to this problem, but I now it doesn't work with every character and it is also very unefficient (in my opinion, at least). What I do is get the predicate format from the predicate, replace what I have to replace, and evaluate that new format instead. Now for some real code that explains this:</p>

<pre><code>#define kPredicateSubstitutionsDict [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys: \
@""IN 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'"", @""== \""Letter (lowercase)\"""", \
@""IN 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'"", @""== \""Letter (uppercase)\"""", \
@""IN 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'"", @""== \""Any letter\"""", \
@""IN '1234567890'"", @""== \""Number\"""", \
@""IN 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890'"", @""== \""Alphanumerical\"""", \
@""IN ',.;:!?'"", @""== \""Ponctuation Mark\"""", \
\
@""MATCHES '[^a-z]'""         , @""!= \""Letter (lowercase)\"""", \
@""MATCHES '[^A-Z]'""         , @""!= \""Letter (uppercase)\"""", \
@""MATCHES '[^a-zA-Z]'""      , @""!= \""Any letter\"""", \
@""MATCHES '[^0-9]'""         , @""!= \""Number\"""", \
@""MATCHES '[^a-zA-Z0-9]'""   , @""!= \""Alphanumerical\"""", \
@""MATCHES '[^,\.;:!\?]'""  , @""!= \""Ponctuation Mark\"""", \
\
nil]

// NSPredicate* predicate is setup in another place
// NSString* originalString is also setup in another place
NSString* predFormat = [predicate predicateFormat];
for (NSString* key in [kPredicateSubstitutionsDict allKeys]) {
    prefFormat = [predFormat stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfString: key withString: [kPredicateSubstitutionsDict objectForKey: key]];
}

for (NSInteger i = 0; i &lt; [originalString length]; i++) {
    NSString* charString = [originalString substringWithRange: NSMakeRange(i, 1)];
    NSString* bfString;
    NSString* afString;

    if (i == 0) {
            bfString = @"""";
    }
    else {
            bfString = [originalString substringWithRange: NSMakeRange(i - 1, 1)];
    }

    if (i == [originalString length] - 1) {
            afString = @"""";
    }
    else {
            afString = [originalString substringWithRange: NSMakeRange(i + 1, 1)];
    }

    predFormat = [predFormat stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfString: @""Character Before"" withString: [NSString stringWithFormat: @""\""%@\"""", bfString]];
    predFormat = [predFormat stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfString: @""Character After"" withString: [NSString stringWithFormat: @""\""%@\"""", afString]];
    predFormat = [predFormat stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfString: @""Character"" withString: [NSString stringWithFormat: @""\""%@\"""", charString]];

    NSPredicate* newPred = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat: predFormat];
    if ([newPred evaluateWithObject: self]) { // self just so I give it something (nothing is actually gotten from self)
        // if predicate evaluates to true, then do something exciting!
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So, here you go, this is a simplified version of what I am doing. If you see any typos, most probably they're not in my code, because I've edited this quite a bit so it would be simpler.</p>

<p>To summarize:</p>

<ul>
<li>I need to evaluate the predicate the user makes against many characters, modifying it quite a bit, while trying to be as efficient as possible</li>
<li><p>The problems I find with my approach are:</p>

<ul>
<li>I don't think it's clean at all</li>
<li>I have no guarantee that it will work on every case (when one of the character is a newline/enter character, the predicate raises an error saying it can't understand the format)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>That's all folks! Thanks for reading thus far. May your god be with you when solving this mess!</p>

<p>EDIT: Just to clarify things abut, I would add that what seems the trigger to this problem is the fact that I cannot, right at the start when I setup the predicate editor, define one constant with a name (that gets displayed to the user) and a value that represents that constant and gets inserted in the predicate format. The same thing for keypaths: if I could have one display name, and then one value that would be those var strings for predicate ($VAR or whatever it is) all the problems would be solved. If this is possible, please tell me how. If it is impossible, then please focus on the other problems I describe.</p>
","115730","","<p>So the main question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Can you build an <code>NSPredicateEditorRowTemplate</code> that uses different constants than what's displayed in the user interface?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Answer: yes.  You used to be able to set this up in Interface Builder, but my attempts to do so in Xcode 4 have been unsuccessful.  It's possible that the capability was removed in the IB => Xcode 4 merge.</p>

<p>Fortunately, you can do it in code.  Unfortunately, it requires an <code>NSPredicateEditorRowTemplate</code> subclass.  I haven't found a way to do it without such a subclass.</p>

<p>The gist is to override <code>-templateViews</code> in your row template, and do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>- (NSArray *)templateViews {
  NSArray *views = [super templateViews];
  // views[0] is the left-hand popup
  // views[1] is the operator popup
  // views[2] is the right-hand side (textfield, popup, whatever)
  NSPopUpButton *left = [views objectAtIndex:0];
  NSArray *items = [left itemArray];
  for (NSMenuItem *item in items) {
    //the representedObject of the item is the expression that will be used in the predicate
    NSExpression *keyPathExpression = [item representedObject];

    //we can alter the -title of the menuItem without altering the expression object
    if ([[keyPathExpression keyPath] isEqual:@""before""]) {
      [item setTitle:@""Character Before""];
    } else if ([[keyPathExpression keyPath] isEqual:@""after""]) {
      [item setTitle:@""Character After""];
    }
  }
  return views;
}
</code></pre>

<p>And voilá!  A popup in your predicate editor where the title does not match the keypath.</p>

<p><strong>edit</strong></p>

<p>The other way to solve this (without subclassing!) would be to put your custom text in a .strings file and ""localize"" your editor to English (or whatever language you want).</p>

</ul>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p>Imagine this situation: a user puts in the predicate editor this expression Character/is not/Number. The format for that predicate would be ""character != ""0123456789"" This is always true, even if the character is a number! How do I ""replace"" these operators: is/is not with their real functions IN/NOT (IN ...)?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you were to express these comparisons in a predicate, you probably wouldn't use <code>!=</code> and <code>==</code>.  Likely, you'd want to do something like:</p>

<pre><code>character MATCHES '[0-9]'
</code></pre>

<p>And one of:</p>

<pre><code>character MATCHES '[^0-9]'
NOT(character MATCHES '[0-9]')
</code></pre>

<p>For this, the way that I can think of to do this would be to have two separate row templates.  One would recognize and display predicates in the first format (<code>MATCHES '[0-9]'</code>), and the second would recognize and display the negation.  You're starting to get into the weird realm of <code>NSPredicateEditorRowTemplates</code>, I think.  I'm still not really sure what you're trying to accomplish and why you want to be matching every character of a string against a predicate, but whatever.</p>

","115730","","<p><code>NSCalendar</code> provides a much easier way to do this:</p>

<pre><code>NSDate *birthday = ...; // the birthday
NSDate *today = [NSDate date];

NSCalendar *c = [NSCalendar currentCalendar];
NSInteger birthdayDayOfYear = [c ordinalityOfUnit:NSDayCalendarUnit inUnit:NSYearCalendarUnit forDate:birthday];
NSInteger todayDayOfYear = [c ordinalityOfUnit:NSDayCalendarUnit inUnit:NSYearCalendarUnit forDate:today];

NSInteger different = birthdayDayOfYear - todayDayOfYear;
</code></pre>

<p>Basically, we're figuring out how far into the year today and the target date are (ie, today [5 Jun] is the 156th day of the year), and then subtract them to figure out how many days are in between them.</p>

<p>This method, of course, relies on the assumption that the target date is in the same year as the current date.  I think it'd be fairly easy to work around that, however.</p>

<hr>

<p>Another, even easier way to do this that will account for multi-year differences is like this:</p>

<pre><code>NSDateComponents *d = [[NSCalendar currentCalendar] components:NSDayCalendarUnit fromDate:today toDate:birthday options:0];
NSInteger difference = [d day];
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>If you need to make sure that the birthday is in the future, that's easily accomplished as well:</p>

<pre><code>NSDateComponents *year = [[[NSDateComponents alloc] init] autorelease];
NSInteger yearDiff = 1;
NSDate *newBirthday = birthday;
while([newBirthday earlierDate:today] == newBirthday) {
  [year setYear:yearDiff++];
  newBirthday = [[NSCalendar currentCalendar] dateByAddingComponents:year toDate:birthday options:0];
}
//continue on with the 2-line calculation above, using ""newBirthday"" instead.
</code></pre>

<p><strong>update</strong> I updated the loop above to always increment from the original date <em>n</em> years at a time, instead of year-by-year.  If someone is born on 29 Feb, incrementing by one year would yield 1 Mar, which would be wrong once you got to a leap year again.  By jumping from the original date each time, we don't have this issue.</p>

It can make absurd optimizations by doing this (for example, a method that returned an autoreleased object under Manual Memory Management may now produce an object that never ends up in an autorelease pool).  If you were to start sprinkling in your own calls to retain and release, then the compiler would have to work with these and wouldn't be able to perform a lot of the optimizations that it wants (and that you should want).</p>

"<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>

<p>The shot below is of Mail.app in OS X Lion. When the source list gets too long, a nice shadowy line appears just above the buttons at the bottom of the source list.

NSPredicate *optionOnePredicate = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@""optionOne contains[cd] %@"", self.sBar.text];

<p>Since you have 3 <code>%@</code> tokens in your string, you need to have 3 <code>self.sBar.text</code> expressions at the end.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you could do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>NSPredicate *template = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@""name contains[cd] $SEARCH OR optionOne contains[cd] $SEARCH OR optionTwo contains[cd] $SEARCH""];
NSDictionary *replace = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObject:self.sBar.text forKey:@""SEARCH""];
NSPredicate *predicate = [template predicateWithSubstitutionVariables:replace];
</code></pre>

<p>This is handier if you're building this predicate a lot, because you can store the ""template"" predicate in an ivar.  Parsing a predicate is not the snappiest of things, and using the template version means you'll only have to parse it once (instead of every time the search bar's text changes).</p>

","115730","","<p><code>FMResultSet</code> objects are pretty transient.  The come and go very quickly.  If you need to preserve information from a result set for any sort of extended period of time (like, longer than your current method), then you should extract the values you care about and save them yourself.</p>

"<p>Take a look at <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/DataManagement/Reference/EKCalendarClassRef/Reference/Reference.html"" rel=""nofollow"">the documentation for EKCalendar</a>. It's pretty simple, it has five properties, only one of which is a string called <code>title</code>. Now if you have multiple calendars on your iPhone and you open iCal's Calendar settings, you can see that all calendars are nicely grouped by another string called <code>account</code>. </p>

<p>What I can't figure out, is how to do the same, because although you can see the <code>account</code> when you <code>NSLog</code> a <code>EKCalendar</code> instance, you can't access it:</p>

<blockquote>

"<p>In the example below, I don't understand why <code>localVariable</code> is being accessed by value in <code>doSomethingWithObject</code>. What makes that conversion? How do you distinguish between accessing a variable by value and accessing it by reference? I would like to see more related examples if possible.</p>

<p>The following is an excerpt from Apple's <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/Blocks/Articles/bxVariables.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40007502-CH6-SW1"" rel=""nofollow""><em>Blocks Programming Topics</em></a> and shows how instance variables are retained in blocks.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you use a block within the
  implementation of a method, the rules
  for memory management of object
  instance variables are more subtle:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>If you access an instance variable by reference, <code>self</code> is retained;</li>
  <li>If you access an instance variable by value, the variable is retained.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>The following examples illustrate the
  two different situations:</p>

<pre><code>dispatch_async(queue, ^{
    // instanceVariable is used by reference, self is retained
    doSomethingWithObject(instanceVariable);
});

id localVariable = instanceVariable;
dispatch_async(queue, ^{
    // localVariable is used by value, localVariable is retained (not self)
    doSomethingWithObject(localVariable);
});
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
","115730","","<p>It's because when you access an instance variable directly, the compiler (more or less) translates that into a struct member lookup.  So:</p>

<pre><code>[ivar doSomething];
</code></pre>

<p>Becomes</p>

<pre><code>[self-&gt;ivar doSomething];
</code></pre>

<p>Because <code>self</code> is needed, <code>self</code> must be retained.  However, when you copy the pointer value into a new variable, you know longer need the <code>self</code> struct to know what the pointer value is, and thus <code>self</code> does not need to be retained, because the pointer value can be <code>const</code> copied off the stack.  That cannot happen with an instance variable (because the ivar could change between when the block is created and when the block is executed).</p>

<hr>

<p>Clarification:</p>

<ul>
<li>a block must retain all of the objects that it references internally to ensure that those objects will continue to exist for the lifetime of the block.</li>
<li>when you access an ivar directly in code, you're really just looking up a member of a struct (since Objective-C objects are really just structs)</li>
<li>looking up a member of a struct means that you have to have the struct</li>
<li>thus, a block will retain the struct (in this case, <code>self</code>) so that the lookup will always succeed.  If it did not do this, then <code>self</code> could potentially be deallocated in the future, and now the struct lookup would cause a bad access (most likely) and your app would crash.</li>
<li>alternatively, you could create a new object pointer locally in the current stack frame.  The upside of this is that you no longer have to retain <code>self</code>, because <code>self</code> is no longer involved in retrieving the address of the object in question</li>
<li>of course, the object referenced by the local variable will be retained to ensure that it exists for the lifetime of the block.</li>
<li>using the terms ""by value"" and ""by reference"" here is completely incorrect.  Objects in Objective-C are always passed by reference, since we <em>always</em> are passing pointers.  You <em>cannot</em> pass an object by-value in Objective-C. (there are some caveats to this, but you <em>really</em> don't want to go there)  For more information on what it means to pass something by-value versus by-reference, check out this question:  <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/373419/whats-the-difference-between-passing-by-reference-vs-passing-by-value"">What&#39;s the difference between passing by reference vs. passing by value?</a></li>

","115730","","<p>Unless I've found a good reason to <em>not</em> use them, <code>NSArray</code> is my de-facto choice.</p>

<p>And in several years of Cocoa programming, I've never really found a good reason to not use it.  The only things I've been able to come up with are when then things I want to store in an array are not objects, or I want to store objects but not have them be retained.  In both of those cases, however, a simple <code>CFMutableArrayRef</code> with custom value callbacks does the trick.</p>

"<p>I have 2 NSManagedObjects entities: VNSource &lt;*--> VNDataChart (using a SQLite backend iOS).
After some user's activities I have NSArray with selected Charts - listChartToDownload (contains VNDataChart objects). </p>

I was successful with result array of VNSource objects by iterating  fetch request for each objects in listChartToDownload. But it seems to me that you have more effective way.  </p>

"<p>I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around this concept. I'll take the quote exactly from the book:</p>

  <p>Class objects also inherit from the classes above them in the hierarchy. But because they don’t have instance variables (only instances do), they inherit only methods.</p>

<p>The thing that confuses me is the second sentence in the quote above, ""But because they don’t have instance variables (only instances do), they inherit only methods.""</p>

<p>I thought that an object (in this case <code>*aString</code>) was the instance of the <code>NSString</code> class. 
The second sentence above is implying that an instance is something different. It's not making any sense to me.</p>

<li>A type: <code>NSString *</code></li>
<li>A variable name: <code>aString</code></li>
<li>an assignment</li>
<li>A <code>Class</code>: <code>NSString</code></li>
<li>An invocation of a class method: <code>+alloc</code></li>
<li>An invocation of an instance method on the return value of the class method: <code>-initWithString:</code></li>
<li>An object being passed as a parameter to the instance method: <code>@""abc...""</code></li>
</ul>

<p>In Objective-C, a <code>Class</code> is actually a kind of object.  You can interact with them in many of the same ways that you can instances, but since they are ""classes"", they cannot have instance variables (since instance variables, by definition, are only for instances).  <code>Classes</code> only have methods.  They inherit from other <code>Classes</code>, and this is how object inheritance is implemented.</p>

"<p>The basic structure of my program has the user select an item from a UITableView, which corresponds to a stored text file. The file is then read into an array and a dictionary, where the array has the keys (I know I can just get the keys from the dictionary itself, this isn't my question).</p>

</code></pre>
","115730","","<p>Here's another approach:</p>

<ul>
<li>Transform the string into actual HTML.  In other words, conver the <code>&amp;lt;</code> and <code>&amp;gt;</code> stuff into <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code></li>
<li>Run it through an <code>NSXMLParser</code></li>
<li>In the <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/cocoa/reference/NSXMLParserDelegate_Protocol/Reference/Reference.html"" rel=""nofollow"">parser delegate</a>, check the attributes dictionary passed into the <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/cocoa/reference/NSXMLParserDelegate_Protocol/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/intfm/NSXMLParserDelegate/parser%3adidStartElement%3anamespaceURI%3aqualifiedName%3aattributes%3a"" rel=""nofollow""><code>-parser:didStartElement:namespaceURI:qualifiedName:attributes:</code></a> method.</li>
<li>If the element name is <code>@""img""</code>, then the <code>attributes</code> dictionary should have a key called <code>@""src""</code> that maps to the string <code>@""http://b.vimeocdn.com/ts/152/946/152946954_200.jpg""</code>.</li>
<li>Once you have the string, it's trivial to transform it into an <code>NSURL</code> using <code>+[NSURL URLWithString:]</code></li>
</ul>

<p>This will work regardless of how the source HTML changes over time.  The other approaches suggested are extremely fragile, because they rely on things like <code>src</code> being all lowercase and there only being a single <code>src</code> attribute anywhere in the string (what if you have 2?).  You don't want to parse HTML; you want to get an attribute out of an XML element.  So use the built-in way of doing it! :)</p>

"<p>I am quite new to Objective-C in some ways, so I'd like to ask how should I make methods that return the objects themselves. Let me show an example:</p>

<p>How I make that kind of method to my own class?</p>
","115730","","<p>There are two main things going on with that method:</p>

<ol>
<li>It's a Class method (ie, a <code>+</code> method)</li>
<li>It uses a variable argument list</li>

<p>To make it, you'd probably do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>+ (id)fooWithStuff:(id)stuff, ... NS_REQUIRES_NIL_TERMINATION {
  // the ""+"" means it's a class method
  // the ""NS_REQUIRES_NIL_TERMINATION"" is so that the compiler knows you have to use it like this:
  // foo = [ThisClass fooWithStuff:thing1, thing2, thing3, nil];
  // (IOW, there must be a ""nil"" at the end of the list)

  va_list args;  // declare a ""variable list""
  va_start(args, stuff);  // the list starts after the ""stuff"" argument

  Foo *foo = [[Foo alloc] init];  // create a Foo object

  id nextStuff = stuff;  // this is the next stuff
  while(nextStuff != nil) { // while there is more stuff...
    [foo doSomethingWithStuff:nextStuff];  // do something with the stuff
    nextStuff = va_arg(args, id);  // get the next stuff in the list
    // the ""id"" means that you're asking for something the size of a pointer

  va_end(args);  // close the argument list

  return [foo autorelease];  // return the Foo object

"<p>I have two entities '<code>Times</code>' &lt;*-> '<code>FileList</code>'. '<code>FileList</code>' - has relation '<code>whenDownload</code>', reverse relation from '<code>Times</code>' is '<code>wichFile</code>'.
Every file in '<code>FileList</code>' could be download several times and myApp stores several versions of files in file system. '<code>Times</code>' helps me to find exact version and other information about file (comments, etc).<br>

<p><strong>1. Could you explane how to get correct predicate with subquery in my case ? <br>
2. What are you recommend to read about subquery (except Predicate programming guide :)</strong></p>

<p>Hope, the question would be interesting for everybody.<br>
Looking forward for your advices.<br>
Nik</p>
","115730","","<p>There are a couple things wrong with your predicate format string:</p>

<pre><code>SUBQUERY (Times, $s, max($s.timeDownload))
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li><p><code>SUBQUERY</code> returns a collection (ie, an array).  Predicates want expressions that evaluate to <code>YES</code> or <code>NO</code>, not to an array.  An array is not a boolean value.  Typically you see something more along the lines of <code>SUBQUERY(...).@count &gt; 0</code>, meaning ""perform this subquery, and then return <code>YES</code> if it returned any objects"".  This may be appropriate in your case, though I'm not really sure;  I'm just evaluating the syntactic correctness of your format string.</p></li>
<li><p>The third parameter to a <code>SUBQUERY</code> must itself be a predicate expression.  It must evaluate to <code>YES</code> or <code>NO</code>.  <code>max(oneThing)</code> does not evaluate to <code>YES</code> or <code>NO</code>; it evaluates to <code>oneThing</code>.  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Assuming you get all of this correct, I'm not sure it's even going to be recognizable by Core Data as the predicate to a fetch request.  Core Data has some pretty stringent requirements on what sorts of things you can do in a predicate.  Additionally, I'm pretty sure that <code>SUBQUERY</code> qualifies as an ""aggregate expression"", which Core Data does <em>not</em> support.</p>

<p>I'd say that about 99% of the time you think you need to use a <code>SUBQUERY</code>, you don't, and you actually shouldn't.  It's very rarely useful, and its use is bizarre enough that it generally makes your predicate harder to understand, and thus less maintainable in the future.</p>

<p>In a nutshell: find a different way to do this.  You have a list of files, and you want to get the <code>Times</code> object corresponding to the last time it was downloaded, right?  I think that'd be something like this:</p>

<pre><code>NSPredicate *p = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@""whichFile.name IN %@ AND timeDownload = whichFile.whenDownload.@max.timeDownload"", listFilesToDownload];
</code></pre>

<p>This assumes that <code>listFilesToDownload</code> is an array of file names, and that your <code>FileList</code> entity has a <code>name</code> property that's the name of the file and matches one in the list...</p>

<p>The bit that (I think) you're interested in is this:</p>

<pre><code>timeDownload = whichFile.whenDownload.@max.timeDownload
</code></pre>

<p>This will evaluate to <code>YES</code> if the download time of this file is equal to the maximum download time of all of the Times of this Time's <code>FileList</code>.  Or something like that.  Your naming is pretty terrible (excusable, since it doesn't appear that English is your native language), and that's definitely hindering my explanation, but there you go.</p>

<p>Enjoy.</p>

"<p>If I have an <code>unsigned char *data</code> pointer and I want to check whether <code>size_t length</code> of the data at that pointer is NULL, what would be the fastest way to do that? In other words, what's the fastest way to make sure a region of memory is blank?</p>

<p>I am implementing in iOS, so you can assume iOS frameworks are available, if that helps. On the other hand, simple C approaches (<code>memcmp</code> and the like) are also OK. </p>

<p>Note, I am <em>not</em> trying to clear the memory, but rather trying to <em>confirm that it is already clear</em> (I am trying to find out whether there is anything at all in some bitmap data, if that helps). For example, I think the following would work, though I have not tried it yet:</p>

<pre><code>- BOOL data:(unsigned char *)data isNullToLength:(size_t)length {
    unsigned char tester[length] = {};
    memset(tester, 0, length);
    if (memcmp(tester, data, length) != 0) {
        return NO;
    }
    return YES;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I would rather not create a tester array, though, because the source data may be quite large and I'd rather avoid allocating memory for the test, even temporarily. But I may just being too conservative there.</p>

<h1>UPDATE: Some Tests</h1>

<p>Thanks to everyone for the great responses below. I decided to create a test app to see how these performed, the answers surprised me, so I thought I'd share them. First I'll show you the version of the algorithms I used (in some cases they differ slightly from those proposed) and then I'll share some results from the field.</p>

<h2>The Tests</h2>

<p>First I created some sample data:</p>

<pre><code>    size_t length = 1024 * 768;
    unsigned char *data = (unsigned char *)calloc(sizeof(unsigned char), (unsigned long)length);
    int i;
    int count;
    long check;
    int loop = 5000;
</code></pre>

<p>Each test consisted of a loop run <code>loop</code> times. During the loop some random data was added to and removed from the <code>data</code> byte stream. Note that half the time there was actually no data added, so half the time the test should not find any non-zero data. Note the <code>testZeros</code> call is a placeholder for calls to the test routines below. A timer was started before the loop and stopped after the loop.</p>

<pre><code>    count = 0;
    for (i=0; i&lt;loop; i++) {
        int r = random() % length;
        if (random() % 2) { data[r] = 1; }
        if (! testZeros(data, length)) {
            count++;
        }
        data[r] = 0;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Test A: nullToLength. This was more or less my original formulation above, debugged and simplified a bit.</p>

<pre><code>- (BOOL)data:(void *)data isNullToLength:(size_t)length {
    void *tester = (void *)calloc(sizeof(void), (unsigned long)length);
    int test = memcmp(tester, data, length);
    free(tester);
    return (! test);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Test B: allZero. Proposal by Carrotman.</p>

<pre><code>BOOL allZero (unsigned char *data, size_t length) {
    bool allZero = true;
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; length; i++){
        if (*data++){
            allZero = false;
            break;
        }
    }
    return allZero;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Test C: is_all_zero. Proposed by Lundin.</p>

<pre><code>BOOL is_all_zero (unsigned char *data, size_t length)
{
    BOOL result = TRUE;
    unsigned char* end = data + length;
    unsigned char* i;

    for(i=data; i&lt;end; i++) {
        if(*i &gt; 0) {
            result = FALSE;
            break;
        }
    }

    return result;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Test D: sumArray. This is the top answer from the <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2589736/fast-way-to-check-if-an-array-of-chars-is-zero"">nearly duplicate question</a>, proposed by vladr.</p>

<pre><code>BOOL sumArray (unsigned char *data, size_t length) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; length; ++i) {
        sum |= data[i];
    }
    return (sum == 0);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Test E: lulz. Proposed by Steve Jessop.</p>

<pre><code>BOOL lulz (unsigned char *data, size_t length) {
    if (length == 0) return 1;
    if (*data) return 0;
    return memcmp(data, data+1, length-1) == 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Test F: NSData. This is a test using NSData object I discovered in the iOS SDK while working on all of these. It turns out Apple does have an idea of how to compare byte streams that is designed to be hardware independent.</p>

<pre><code>- (BOOL)nsdTestData: (NSData *)nsdData length: (NSUInteger)length {
    void *tester = (void *)calloc(sizeof(void), (unsigned long)length);
    NSData *nsdTester = [NSData dataWithBytesNoCopy:tester length:(NSUInteger)length freeWhenDone:NO];
    int test = [nsdData isEqualToData:nsdTester];
    free(tester);
    return (test);
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>So how did these approaches compare? Here are two sets of data, each representing 5000 loops through the check. First I tried this on the iPhone Simulator running on a relatively old iMac, then I tried this running on a first generation iPad.</p>

<p>On the iPhone 4.3 Simulator running on an iMac:</p>

<pre><code>// Test A, nullToLength:  0.727 seconds
// Test F, NSData:        0.727
// Test E, lulz:          0.735
// Test C, is_all_zero:   7.340
// Test B, allZero:       8.736
// Test D, sumArray:     13.995
</code></pre>

<p>On a first generation iPad:</p>

<pre><code>// Test A, nullToLength: 21.770 seconds
// Test F, NSData:       22.184
// Test E, lulz:         26.036
// Test C, is_all_zero:  54.747
// Test B, allZero:      63.185
// Test D, sumArray:     84.014
</code></pre>

<p>These are just two samples, I ran the test many times with only slightly varying results. The order of performance was always the same: A &amp; F very close, E just behind, C, B, and D. I'd say that A, F, and E are virtual ties, on iOS I'd prefer F because it takes advantage of Apple's protection from processor change issues, but A &amp; E are very close. The memcmp approach clearly wins over the simple loop approach, close to ten times faster in the simulator and twice as fast on the device itself. Oddly enough, D, the winning answer from the other thread performed very poorly in this test, probably because it does not break out of the loop when it hits the first difference.</p>

It's just like <code>malloc()</code>, except it zeros out the buffer first.  It's what's used to allocate memory for Objective-C objects and is the reason that all ivars default to 0.</p>

<p>Well, you've already had the thought of ""why not one entity with a flag field denoting type?"", and that is an excellent question, and I would very much recommend going with that route.</p>

<p>I can setup a macro printCommand to log the receiver and selector of a method call as follows:</p>

<pre><code>#define printMethodCall NSLog (@""%@ %@"", self, NSStringFromSelector(_cmd));

<p>Question -- can the above be extended to log all arguments that were passed with the method call, however few or many, and whatever types, they may be?</p>
","115730","","<p>Yes you can do this, but it's quite difficult.</p>

<p>The trick is to realize that a method is really just a function, and that you can create a <code>va_list</code> from the arguments, even if the method/function wasn't declared to take <code>...</code> in the signature.</p>

<p>The pseudo code would be something roughly like this:</p>

<pre><code>va_list args;
// start your argument list after the ""_cmd"" argument
va_start(args, _cmd); 
// get the Method for this (instance) method
Method thisMethod = class_getInstanceMethod([self class], _cmd);

const char *methodType = method_getTypeEncoding(thisMethod);
// use the type encoding string to make an NSMethodSignature
NSMethodSignature *signature = [NSMethodSignature signatureWithObjCTypes:methodType];

// iterate through all the arguments, skipping 0 (self) and 1 (_cmd)
for (NSUInteger i = 2; i &lt; [signature numberOfArguments]; ++i) {
  // get the type of the argument
  const char *type = [signature getArgumentTypeAtIndex:i];

  // if this argument type is the same as an object, pull out an object
  if (strcmp(@encode(id), type) == 0) {
    id nextArg = va_arg(args, id);
    NSLog(@""object argument: %@"", nextArg);

  // if this argument type is the same as a float, pull out a float
  } else if (strcmp(@encode(float), type) == 0) {
    float nextArg = va_arg(args, float);
    NSLog(@""float argument: %f"", nextArg);
  } ...

  // repeat as necessary for all the types you care to log
}
// cleanup
va_end(args);

<pre><code>[[MyClassBank sharedBank] doneWithItem:obj];
</code></pre>

<p>Currently, My code would work if I where to use it this way, but I later realized that I sometimes add ""obj"" to an ""NSCollection"", and sometimes I call:</p>

<pre><code>[theCollection removeAllObjects];
</code></pre>

<p>At first I thought about making my own class that is composed of a collection, then I would iterate the objects within the collection and call:</p>

<pre><code>[[MyClassBank sharedBank] doneWithItem:obj];
</code></pre>

<p>But, that's too much of a hassle, isn't?</p>

<p>A neat idea (I think) popped into my mind, which is to override: <code>-(oneway void)release;</code>, so, I immediately jumped to Apple's documentation, but got stuck with the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You would only implement this method to define your own reference-counting scheme. Such implementations should not invoke the inherited method; that is, they should not include a release message to super.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ao, I was reluctant to do that idea .. basically:</p>

<pre><code>-(oneway void)release{
    if ([self retainCount] == 1) {
        //This will increment retain count by adding self to the collection.
        [[MyClassBank sharedBank] doneWithItem:self];
    }
    [super release];
}
</code></pre>

<p>Is it safe to do that?</p>

<p>PS: Sorry for the long post, I want the whole idea to be clear..</p>

<p><b>EDIT:</b></p>

<p><strike>How about overriding <code>alloc</code> alltogther and adding <code>[[MyClassBank sharedBank] getReusableItem];</code> there?</strike></p>
","115730","","<h2>Suggested method:</h2>

<p>You're playing with the reference counting system.  99.9999999999999999% of the time this is a bad idea.  I would highly recommend going with a different mechanism.  Perhaps these objects could implement their own reference count that's independent of the <code>retainCount</code>?  Then you could use that referenceCount to actually control when an object is ready to be re-used or not.</p>

<h2>Not suggested method:</h2>

<p>If, for some weird reason, you can't do that, then you could do the following thing <strong>that is still a bad idea and that i don't recommend you actually use</strong>:</p>

<p>You can override <code>dealloc</code>:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)dealloc {
  [ivar release], ivar = nil;
  [anotherIvar release], anotherIvar = nil;
  somePrimitive = 0;
  // do not call [super dealloc]
}

- (void)_reallyDealloc {
  [self dealloc];  // clean up any ivars declared at this level
  [super dealloc]; // then continue on up the chain
}
</code></pre>

<p>Basically, the <code>dealloc</code> method would be the point at which the object is ready for re-use.  When you're totally done with the object and finally want it to go away, you can use the <code>_reallyDealloc</code> method to continue on up the chain, eventually resulting in the object getting freed.</p>

<p><strong>PLEASE</strong> don't do this.  With things like Automatic Reference Counting, this is going to introduce you into a world of hurt and really bizarre debugging scenarios.  A <em>lot</em> of the tools and classes and stuff depend on the reference counting mechanism to be working without alteration, so screwing around with it is usually not a Good Idea™.</p>

<p>Long answer:  Nothing in UIKit is guaranteed to be KVO-compliant.  If you happen to find that KVO-ing a property works, be grateful, it's unintentional.  Also: be wary.  It could very well break in the future.</p>

<p>If you find that this is something you need, please <a href=""http://bugreport.apple.com"">file an enhancement request</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p>About your actual code, it's inherently flawed.  Do <em>NOT</em> attempt to add a ""rootViewController"" setter to <code>UIWindow</code> this way.  It <strong>will</strong> break when you compile your code on iOS 4 but someone runs it on an iOS 5 device.  Because you compiled using the 4.x SDK,  the <code>#if</code> statements will evaluate to true, meaning your category method smasher will be included in the binary.  However, when you run it on an iOS 5 device, you're now going to get a method conflict because two methods on <code>UIWindow</code> will have the same method signature, and <em>there's no guarantee as to which one will be used</em>.</p>

<p>Don't screw with the frameworks like this.  If you have to have this, use a subclass.  THIS IS WHY SUBCLASSING EXISTS.</p>

(gdb) p *(SEL*)($ebp + 12)
$5 = (SEL) 0xbd19

(gdb) po *(id*)($ebp + 16)
&lt;UIWebDocumentView: 0xa02f000; frame = (0 0; 240 457); text = 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit er ...'; opaque = NO; userInteractionEnabled = NO; layer = &lt;UIWebLayer: 0x5c35070&gt;&gt;

","115730","","<p>Assuming this is for academic interests <em>only</em>....</p>

<p>One way you could find out is to break on the symbol in GDB and inspect the parameters.  You know what <em>general</em> kind they are (ie, <code>float</code> vs <code>object</code>, etc), so you can simply use the right <code>p</code> command to print them.</p>

<p>To set the breakpoint, you can either do:</p>

<ol>
<li>In the gdb console, type <code>b -[UITextView keyboardInput:shouldInsertText:isMarkedText:]</code></li>
<li>In Xcode, add a new symbolic breakpoint for <code>-[UITextView keyboardInput:shouldInsertText:isMarkedText:]</code></li>
</ol>

<p>When you actually hit the breakpoint, you're not going to see anything useful (of course).  But you <em>can</em> print the arguments out at this point, because you know their sizes, and thus where they should be in the registers.</p>

<p>For more info on which registers they're in, check out <a href=""http://www.clarkcox.com/blog/2009/02/04/inspecting-obj-c-parameters-in-gdb/"" rel=""nofollow"">this handy blog post</a>.  You can also do something like <code>info all-registers</code> to print out all the information in all the registers, etc.</p>

"<p>I may be trying to abuse the preprocessor. I want to see if what I have in mind is even possible.</p>

- (void) setAccelerometerSensitivity:(float) n {
    [dict setFloat:n forSelector:_cmd];

- (void) setReturnSpringTension:(float) n {

}
// set*ForSelector methods are in a category on NSMutableDictionary and depend on a function that translates selectors into strings:
// NSString* keyFromSelector(SEL selector);
</code></pre>

<p>The idea is that instead of using string literals (or string constants) as keys into the dictionary, I derive the string from the selector name. This way I am sure that the spelling of the key matches the property name and essentially get the benefit of compile-time validation of dictionary keys.</p>

<p>What I want to do is say something like <code>SELECTOR_PROPERY(accelerometerSensitivity)</code> and have it expand into the the getter and the setter.

NSLog(@""getter name: %@"", getterName); \
NSLog(@""setter name: %@"", setterName); \

MACRO(bar);

"<p>Can I fire an event when ever there is Incoming and Outgoing call ends on iphone? Axample of an event is calling a webservice .</p>
","115730","","<p>Yes you can, but not necessarily immediately.</p>

<p>There is a framework, called the CoreTelephony framework, which has a <code>CTCallCenter</code> class.  One of the properties on this class is the <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Reference/CTCallCenter/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009604-CH1-DontLinkElementID_2"" rel=""nofollow""><code>callEventHandler</code> property</a>.  This is a block that gets fired when then <em>state</em> of a phone call changes.  For example:</p>

<pre><code>CTCallCenter *callCenter = ...; // get a CallCenter somehow; most likely as a global object or something similar?

[callCenter setCallEventHandler:^(CTCall *call) {
  if ([[call callState] isEqual:CTCallStateConnected]) {
    //this call has just connected
  } else if ([[call callState] isEqual:CTCallStateDisconnected]) {
    //this call has just ended (dropped/hung up/etc)
  }
}];
</code></pre>

<p>That's <em>really</em> about all you can do with this.  You don't get access to any phone numbers.  The only other useful tidbit of information is an identifier property on <code>CTCall</code> so you uniquely identify a <code>CTCall</code> object.</p>

<p><strong>CAUTION</strong>:</p>

<p>This event handler is <em>not</em> invoked unless your app is in the foreground!  If you make and receive calls while the app is backgrounded, the event handler will not fire <em>until your app becomes active again</em>, at which point (according to the documentation linked to above) the event handler will get invoked once for each <em>call</em> that has changed state while the app was in the background. </p>

","115730","","<p>My advice: <strong>Do not write this code yourself</strong>.  Having written code that does this, there are some things to be aware of:</p>

<p>Parsing mathematical expressions is not a trivial problem, if you're going to do it correctly and fully.  You have to consider things like the associativity of each operator: what happens if you find more than one of the same operator in an expression?  Which one do you evaluate first?  How do you deal with operators whose precedence changes depending on their context? (for example, the negation operator)  These are hard questions, and very few implementations get it right.</p>

<p>As was mentioned in a comment on the question, there are some things that can do this for you already:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>NSPredicate</code>.  Pros: built-in, reasonably fast, decent precision.  Cons: the exponent is parsed with incorrect associativity, not extensible, does not support implicit multiplication (i.e., <code>2(x*x)</code>), does not parse the negation operator correctly.</li>
<li><code>GCMathParser</code>.  Pros: <em>very fast</em>, decent precision.  Cons: not extensible, does not support implicit multiplication, does not parse the negation operator correctly.</li>
<li><code>DDMathParser</code>.  Pros: excellent precision, extensible, supports implicit multiplication.  Cons: not quite as fast as the other two, due to the parsing engine and high precision math</li>
</ol>

<p>Obviously, I recommend <code>DDMathParser</code> (I wrote it).  In your case, you'd want to do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>NSError *error = nil;
NSString *math = [DDExpression expressionFromString:@""2($x * $x) + 2"" error:&amp;error];

for (int x = 0; x &lt; 100; ++x) {
  NSNumber *variable = [NSNumber numberWithInt:x];
  NSDictionary *sub = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObject:variable forKey:@""x""];
  NSNumber *value = [math evaluateWithSubstitutions:sub evaluator:nil error:&amp;error];
  NSLog(@""value: %@"", value);
}
</code></pre>

<p><code>DDMathParser</code> is available on GitHub: <a href=""https://github.com/davedelong/DDMathParser"">https://github.com/davedelong/DDMathParser</a> .  Please be mindful of its license (free for use with attribution).</p>

<p>However, if you're ok with sacrificing some precision (and a couple of cases of it being incorrect) in exchange for blazing fast speed, I'd recommend using <a href=""http://apptree.net/parser.htm""><code>GCMathParser</code></a>.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","115730","","<p>Welcome to the wonderful world of date calculations!</p>

<p>@Vladimir is correct.  November 6th happens to have ~90,000 seconds in it because that's the day (in the US on the Gregorian calendar) that Daylight Savings Time takes effect.  Accept his answer; it's the right one.</p>

<p><em>This</em> one is to educate you a bit more, because <em>this is a hard topic</em>.</p>

<p>An <code>NSDate</code> represents an absolute point in time.  This point is immutable.  It will exist regardless of whether humans and their time measurements exist.</p>

<p>A ""day"" is a relative value.  It is relative to many things, such as:</p>

<ol>
<li>The planet earth.  A martian day is not the same thing as an earth day</li>
<li>The calendar of the person doing the calculation.  Not all calendars measure time in the same way.</li>
</ol>

<p>Thus, it is <em>impossible</em> to take a relative value and add it to an absolute value <em>without more context</em>.  You have no idea what the relative value is relative <em>to</em>.  You make the assumption that everyone is using the same point of reference as you, and that assumption is <strong>wrong</strong>.  For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>The current year is 2011.  But is it?  ""2011"" is relative to the Gregorian calendar.  What if you're not using the Gregorian calendar?</li>
<li>The current year is 23.  But that's only if you're using the Japanese calendar and specifically using the Japanese era names.</li>
<li>The current year is 5771.  But that's only if you're using the Hebrew calendar.  And the turnover for the next year (5772) is not the same turnover as the next Gregorian year.</li>
<li>The current year is (probably) 1432.  If you're a Muslim.</li>
<li>The current year is 4344, if you're Korean.</li>
</ul>

<p>And so on and so on.</p>

<p>As a general rule, most calendars are solar based, meaning that one orbit around the sun is equivalent to one ""year"" in that calendar.  But this makes things REALLY complicated, because the number of rotations the Earth makes (a ""day"") in its orbit around the Sun is not an integral (whole) number.  It's something like 365.24 rotations.  Enter leap days!  But only in certain calendars!  In other calendars, we have whole leap months!  Or leap seconds.  Or leap hours.  Or leap-whatever-time-unit-you-wants.  And don't even get me started on time zones.</p>

<p>So, how do you deal with this?</p>

<p>The simple answer: <strong>YOU DON'T</strong>.  People much smarter than you or I have already written the code to handle all of this for us.</p>

<p>BEHOLD:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSCalendar_Class/Reference/NSCalendar.html""><code>NSCalendar</code></a></li>
<li><a href=""http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSDateComponents_Class/Reference/Reference.html""><code>NSDateComponents</code></a></li>
</ul>

<p>An <code>NSCalendar</code> encapsulates all of the rules and regulations for calculating time (on Earth) according to that system of measurement.  <code>NSDateComponents</code> encapsulates the <em>relative nature</em> of measuring time.</p>

<p>So you have an absolute point in time (an <code>NSDate</code>), and you want to know what day of the week it corresponds to.  Here's what you do:</p>

<ul>
<li>Get the appropriate calendar object.  For almost everything you'll ever do, this is probably <code>[NSCalendar currentCalendar]</code>.</li>
<li>Using the calendar, you say ""i want such-and-such 'date components' from this absolute point in time""</li>
</ul>

<p>The calendar's going to churn and burn and give you back an <code>NSDateComponents</code> that signify whatever information you're looking for.</p>

<p>Or let's say you have an absolute point in time and you want to know ""what's the absolute point in time 1 week later?"".  Who knows how long a week is?  I don't.  It's <em>usually</em> 7 days, but it doesn't have to be.  That's just what I'm familiar with.  But I'm sure there are calendars out there that are based on non-7-day weeks.  So you make an <code>NSDateComponents</code> object, lash it up to mean ""1 week"", and say ""calendar: I have this date and this relative amount.  Add them and tell me the new date"" and it does that.</p>

<p>&lt;update&gt;</p>

<p>However, adding date components to dates can also be problematic.  For example, what if you want to find the last day of every month this year?  (We'll assume the Gregorian calendar here)  So you start with an <code>NSDate</code> that happens to fall on Jan 31 and you add ""1 month"" to it.  What do you get?  Feb 28!  So then you add one month to <em>that</em>.  What do you get?  Mar 28!  That's not the end of the month anymore!  </p>

<p>The way to fix <em>that</em> is to always compute the new date from the original date.  So instead of adding 1 month to each successive date, you add ""n"" months to the original date.  And that will work correctly.</p>

<p>&lt;/update&gt;</p>

<p>You can see how this is a difficult topic.  In case you haven't, here's one last hint:</p>

<h1>THIS IS A DIFFICULT TOPIC</h1>

<p>The sooner you learn to do things correctly, the happier you and your code will be.  :)</p>
"
"<p>What I used to do was using the timestamp and then adding 86400 seconds ( 24 * 60 * 60 ). As I read a recent question on stackoverflow noting that that is not correct for every day, I want to change this.</p>

<p>So the next thing I came up with was by using NSDateComponents. I simply get the current day and add 1. Now I was wondering how ""smart"" that is. Like if the day is equal to 31, does it set the day to 1 and the month to whatever it is +1 ( or when it is 12 to 1 again ) ? I can do this manually but that would only work properly for the gregorian calendar so I don't really know whether that would be a good solution either..</p>

<p>Another option is to report a very large number of rows (like, say, 100000) in your <code>UITableView</code>, and then silently adjust the scroll location of the tableview whenever it stops scrolling.  (<code>[tableView scrollToRowAtIndexPath:anIndexPath animated:NO];</code>)  You might have issues with preserving the exact scroll location, but you might be able to work around that as well by maybe using <code>setContentOffset:animated:</code>?  I'm not quite sure; I'd have to try it.</p>

<p>In practice however, it usually works.  For example, this is how <code>UIDatePicker</code> achieves its ""infinite"" scrolling when displaying dates.  However, the row positioning constraints on <code>UIDatePicker</code> are different than they are on <code>UITableView</code>, but the <em>principle</em> is the same...</p>

<p>I also have this code:</p>

<pre><code>    NSCalendar *gregorian = [[NSCalendar alloc] initWithCalendarIdentifier:NSGregorianCalendar];

<p>but the Timezones it displays are off for many of the regions.</p>

<p>Thanks ahead of time for your help.</p>
","115730","","<p>Here we go again...</p>

<p>A date is an independent point in time.  It exists and will always exist, regardless of whether or not humans and our time measurement devices exist.  Time zones are an invention of man to help us not go crazy.  The jury's still out on whether or not they're effective at that. :P</p>

<p>When you talk about wanting a ""date in EDT or any other timezone"", you've failed to grasp what a date is.  A timezone is simply one aspect of <em>how to display a point in time</em>.</p>

<p>So, you have an <code>NSDate</code>.  This date is the <em>correct</em> date, <em>regardless</em> of what timezone you're in.  So how do you ""display the time in the current time zone""?  You use an <code>NSDateFormatter</code>.</p>

<p>An <code>NSDate</code> is inherently unreadable.  There are ways that we can <em>represent</em> a date, such as an interval of seconds (which is an arbitrarily long interval itself) from a different point in time.  However, to make a date <em>human readable</em> can only be accomplished by formatting it into a string.  So, let's do that:</p>

<pre><code>NSDate *myDate = [NSDate date]; // or whatever date you want to make human-readable
NSDateFormatter *f = [[NSDateFormatter alloc] init];
[f setDateStyle:NSDateFormatterLongStyle];
[f setTimeStyle:NSDateFormatterLongStyle];

NSArray *timeZoneNames = [NSTimeZone knownTimeZoneNames];
for (NSString *name in timeZoneNames) {
    NSTimeZone *tz = [NSTimeZone timeZoneWithName:name];
    [f setTimeZone:tz];
    NSLog(@""%@"", [f stringFromDate:date]);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, obviously the output for this is going to be enormously long (mine is over 400 lines long).  But here's a sampling of that output:</p>

<p>So, what do we see here?  The <em>same date</em> has a whole bunch of <em>different</em> string representations!  NEAT!  In other words, the timezone of the <em>formatter</em> is what's used in determining what the outputted string looks like.</p>

<p>And so: the date itself has <strong>NOTHING</strong> to do with the timezone.  If you want a date to <em>look</em> a certain way, you have to configure the <em>formatter</em> to make it look that way.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update</strong> From your comment, I think I get what you want.  You want the <em>date components</em> formatted for a certain timezone?  In other words, you have a point in time, and you want to know what hour/minute/second that is in (say) the US Eastern timezone?</p>

<p>If that's the case, then you do that based on the <em>calendar</em>:</p>

<pre><code>NSDate *date = [NSDate date];
NSCalendar *cal = [NSCalendar currentCalendar];
[cal setTimeZone:[NSTimeZone timeZoneWithName:@""EST""]];

NSDateComponents *components = [cal components:NSUIntegerMax fromDate:date];
NSLog(@""%@"", components);

"<p>I have to convert a Double value into a Date value in Objective-C
I tried many ways but im not getting it.</p>

<pre><code>date=var1/24;
</code></pre>

<p>Here <code>var1</code> is a double value which should be divided by 24 and stored as a Date into the variable date. How can I do this using Objective-C?</p>

<p>I created the date variable like this:</p>

<pre><code>NSDate *date=[[NSDate alloc]init];
date=(nsdate)var1/24;
</code></pre>

<p>How can I do this?</p>
","115730","","<blockquote>
  <p>Its a Double Variable.. which will be containing values upto 24 it will be representing HOURS from TODAY..</p>
</blockquote>

<p>OK, so you have a <em>relative</em> value that you want to add to an <em>absolute</em> value.  Additional work is required.</p>

<p>First, you must decide ""What is today?"".  Is it 12:01am?  If it is, in which time zone?  GMT?  Something else?  You <em>have</em> to know this, because 12:01am GMT is not the same thing as 12:01am EDT.  So: what is today?</p>

<p>Once you've decided where you're going to be measuring time <em>from</em>, you have to construct an <code>NSDate</code> representing that point in time.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>NSDate *rightNow = [NSDate date];
NSCalendar *calendar = [NSCalendar currentCalendar];
NSDateComponents *components = [calendar components:NSUIntegerMax fromDate:rightNow];
</code></pre>

<p>This will give you an <code>NSDateComponents</code> object, which is an object that represents a point in time <em>relative to a calendar</em>.  In this case, we're using the ""current calendar"" (probably the Gregorian calendar, but not necessarily), and the default time zone is your current time zone.  If you need to have it be relative to a different time zone, you can create a new <code>NSTimeZone</code> object and use <code>-[NSCalendar setTimeZone:]</code> to set the calendar's time zone (before asking for the date components).</p>

<p>Now that you've got the date components, we can ""reset"" things to the appropriate time:</p>

<pre><code>[components setHour:0];
[components setMinute:0];
[components setSecond:0];
</code></pre>

<p>Then we can turn it back into an <code>NSDate</code> to make it an absolute point in time:</p>

<pre><code>NSDate *startingPoint = [calendar dateFromComponents:components];
</code></pre>

<p><em>NOW</em> we have our starting point, and can deal with the ""hours from today"".  First, we'll create a date components object to represent however many hours the difference is:</p>

<pre><code>NSInteger hourDelta = var1 / 24;
NSDateComponents *delta = [[NSDateComponents alloc] init];
[delta setHour:hourDelta];
</code></pre>

<p>Now, we'll add this relative difference to our absolute starting date:</p>

<pre><code>NSDate *finalDate = [calendar dateByAddingComponents:delta toDate:startingPoint options:0];
</code></pre>

<p>And because we're good citizens, we'll clean up our memory (unless you're using Garbage Collection or compiling with ARC):</p>

<pre><code>[delta release];
</code></pre>

<p>Some important notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>All of the manipulations are done via the <code>NSCalendar</code> object, because the <code>NSCalendar</code> is what defines what a ""day"" means and what an ""hour"" is.  You think ""there are 24 hours in a day and 60 minutes in an hour..."", but that's not necessarily true.  I can create my own calendar that has 10 hours in a day, and 10 minutes in an hour.  If I want, I can define a ""day"" as something other than ""one full rotation of the Earth"".  The <code>NSCalendar</code> define all these rules.  Thus, all relative manipulations of dates (adding ""hours"" and ""days"" or whatever) must be done via the calendar.</li>
<li>There are methods on <code>NSDate</code> like <code>-dateByAddingTimeInterval:</code>, but this is for when you're dealing with absolute intervals and <em>not</em> relative amounts.</li>

","115730","","<p>Simple answer: you can't.</p>

<p>Real answer: you haven't understood what Core Data is.</p>

<h1>Core Data is not a database.  It is not SQL.  It is not a relational database in any way shape or form.</h1>

<p>Core Data is a framework for abstracting the persistence of objects from their in-memory representation.  It is an object management framework.  You interact with it via objects.  You do not create queries.  You do not execute SQL.  You request objects.  Full blown, <code>NSObject</code> subclasses.</p>

"<p>I'm implementing <a href=""https://github.com/davedelong/CHCSVParser"" rel=""nofollow"">CHCSVParser</a> into my iPhone app (thanks Dave!) however I'm really confused on how to use it.  I've read the read-me and searched some questions on SO but still not 100% sure what to do.</p>

<p>I have a .CSV file with maybe 5000 rows of data and 3-4 columns.</p>

<p>I want this data to in return, load my UITableView along with its corresponding detailViewController.</p>

<p>So I'm assuming I need to somehow implement the API's array method but can anyone help get me started?</p>
","115730","","<p>I'm glad you like it :)</p>

<p>Basically, <code>CHCSVParser</code> <em>only</em> parses CSV files.  You give it a path to a CSV file, and it'll give you back a whole bunch of <code>NSStrings</code>.  What you do beyond that point is entirely up to you.</p>

<p>So let's say you've included a CSV file in your iOS app called ""Data.csv"".  Here's how you'd use <code>CHCSVParser</code> to parse it:</p>

<pre><code>NSString *path = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@""Data"" ofType:@""csv""];

NSError *error = nil;
NSArray *rows = [NSArray arrayWithContentsOfCSVFile:path encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding error:&amp;error];
if (rows == nil) {
  //something went wrong; log the error and exit
  NSLog(@""error parsing file: %@"", error);
  return;
}
</code></pre>

<p>At this point, <code>rows</code> is an array.  Each element in <code>rows</code> is itself an array representing a single row in the CSV file.  And each element of <em>that</em> array is an <code>NSString</code>.</p>

<p>So let's say your CSV file looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>Barringer,Arizona,United States,Earth
""Chicxulub, Extinction Event Crater"",,Mexico,Earth
Tycho,,,Moon
Lonar,Maharashtra,India,Earth
</code></pre>

<p>If you run it through the parser, you'll get back the equivalent of this:</p>

<pre><code>[NSArray arrayWithObjects:
 [NSArray arrayWithObjects:@""Barringer"",@""Arizona"",@""United States"",@""Earth"",nil],
 [NSArray arrayWithObjects:@""Chicxulub, Extinction Event Crater"",@"""",@""Mexico"",@""Earth"",nil],
 [NSArray arrayWithObjects:@""Tycho"",@"""",@"""",@""Moon"",nil],
 [NSArray arrayWithObjects:@""Lonar"",@""Maharashtra"",@""India"",@""Earth"",nil],
 nil];
</code></pre>

<p>What you do with it then is your business.  The CSV parser doesn't know anything about <code>UITableView</code>, so you get to take this data and re-structure it in a way that you're comfortable dealing with and that fits in to your data model.</p>

<p>Also, remember that by using <code>CHCSVParser</code>, you agree to abide <a href=""https://github.com/davedelong/CHCSVParser/blob/master/LICENSE"">the terms under which it is made available</a>.  :)</p>

<p>AirPrint is a technology that was created by Apple and is licensed for free to printer manufacturers.

You'll need to actually generate content to print, but that can be as simple as passing a <code>UIImage</code> in or giving it a string of markup.

Inside of the UIView, called DrawView, in my <code>drawRect:</code> method, I draw a table grid type thing, and plot an array of CGPoints on the grid. When the user taps on the screen, it calls <code>touchesBegan:withEvent:</code> and checks to find the closest point on the grid to the touch, adds a point to the array that the <code>drawRect:</code> method draws points from, and calls <code>[self setNeedsDisplay]</code>. As the user moves their finger around the screen, it checks to see if the point changed from the last location, and updates the point and calls <code>[self setNeedsDisplay]</code> as necessary.</p>

<p>This works great in the Simulator. However, when run on a real iPhone, it runs very slowly, when you move your finger around, it lags in drawing the dot. I have read that running calculations for where to place the points in a different thread can improve performance. Does anyone have experience with this that knows this for a fact? Any other suggestions to reduce lag?</p>

<p>Yes.  Don't use <code>-drawRect:</code>.  It's a long and complicated reason why, but basically when UIKit sees that you've implemented <code>-drawRect:</code> in your <code>UIView</code> subclass, rendering goes through the really slow software-based rendering path.  When you draw with <code>CALayer</code> objects and composite views, you can get hardware accelerated graphics, which can make your app FAR more performant.</p>

"<p>I need a Cocoa class that can read and write from a memory stream and that supports seeking; in C#, <code>MemoryStream</code> supports the method <code>seek</code>, and in Java, <code>ByteArrayInputStream</code> supports the methods <code>mark</code>, <code>skip</code>, and <code>reset</code>.</p>

<p>In iOS developmen, what is the equivalent class and method?</p>

","115730","","<p>Do you <em>have</em> to use a function pointer?  In Objective-C, you can get the function pointer to an arbitrary method implementation (known as an <code>IMP</code>), but this is <em>extremely</em> uncommon, and usually not a good idea.  Calling <code>objc_msgSend()</code> directly is also not the greatest idea, because there are several different variants of <code>objc_msgSend()</code>, and the compiler automatically chooses different ones to use based on the return type of the method.  Methods that return an object go through <code>objc_msgSend()</code>, but objects that return structs might go through <code>objc_msgSend()</code> or they might go through <code>objc_msgSend_stret()</code>.  And if the method returns a <code>double</code>, then it goes through <code>objc_msgSend_fpret()</code>...</p>

"<p>XCode is suggesting that an <code>[NSString initWithFormat]</code> method (as listed in the Instruments window) is the source of a memory leak. It lists the particular method, so in that method I identified the only line of code with <code>initWithFormat</code> (as unlike some leaks identified in Instruments, this one will not take me to the exact offending line of code for some reason):</p>

<pre><code> NSString * name=[[NSString alloc] initWithFormat:@""%@"",[[lineArray objectAtIndex:0] stringByTrimmingCharactersInSet:[NSCharacterSet whitespaceAndNewlineCharacterSet]] ];

<p>UPDATE: I've added all the code between the <code>initWithFormat</code> and the <code>release</code> -- Also, even if I change <code>initWithFormat</code> to <code>stringWithFormat</code>, Xcode gives me the same memory leak, instead identifying <code>stringWithFormat</code>, so this is clearly the object causing the problem.</p>
","115730","","<p>Instruments doesn't show where the object was leaked; it shows where the object that was leaked was <em>created</em>.

"<p>I have an array with file names and I want to find all the names that end with e.g. <em>00001.trc</em> when <code>traceNum</code> is 1. I tried this:</p>

<pre><code>NSPredicate *tracePredicate = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@""SELF ENDSWITH \""%05d.trc\"""", traceNum];
</code></pre>

<p>and my predicate was <code>SELF ENDSWITH ""%05d.trc""</code> instead of <code>SELF ENDSWITH ""00001.trc""</code></p>

<pre><code>NSPredicate *tracePredicate = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@""SELF ENDSWITH %@%05d.trc%@"", @""\"""", traceNum, @""\""""];

<p>and I got an exception: <code>Unable to parse the format string ""SELF ENDSWITH %@%05d.trc%@""</code>.</p>

<p>So I tried this:</p>

<pre><code>NSPredicate *tracePredicate = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:[NSString stringWithFormat:@""SELF ENDSWITH \""%05d.trc\"""", traceNum]];
</code></pre>

<p>and it works. </p>

<p>So do I really need <code>stringWithFormat</code> in addition to <code>predicateWithFormat</code> or is there something I'm not doing correctly in creating my predicate?</p>
","115730","","<p>You're correct; <code>predicateWithFormat:</code> is not quite the same as <code>stringWithFormat:</code>.</p>

<p>It's different for a couple major reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>It's not actually creating a new string.  It's just looking through the format string and seeing what the next thing to substitute is, popping that off the <code>va_list</code>, and boxing it up into the appropriate <code>NSExpression</code> object.</li>
<li>It has to support a format specifier that <code>NSString</code> doesn't: <code>%K</code>.  This is how you substitute in a key path.  If you tried to substitute in the name of a property using <code>%@</code>, it would actually be interpreted as a literal string, and not as a property name.</li>
<li>Using formatting constraints (I'm not sure what the proper term is) like the <code>05</code> in <code>%05d</code> isn't supported.  For one, it doesn't make sense.  <code>NSPredicate</code> does numerical comparisons (in which case <code>00005</code> is the same thing as <code>5</code>, and thus the zero padding is irrelevant) and string comparisons (in which you can just format the string yourself before giving it to <code>NSPredicate</code>).  (It does other comparisons, like collection operations, but I'm skipping those for now)</li>
</ol>

<p>So, how do you do what you're trying to do?  The best way would be like this:</p>

<pre><code>NSString *trace = [NSString stringWithFormat:@""%05d.trc"", traceNum];
NSPredicate *p = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@""SELF ENDSWITH %@"", trace];
</code></pre>

<p>This way you can do all the formatting you want, but still use the more correct approach of passing a constant string as the predicate format.</p>

<p>How can we achieve such type of selected values to be changed with <strong>mins</strong> and <strong>secs</strong> in UIPickerView???</p>
","115730","","<p>First, you use the <code>pickerView:viewForRow:inComponent:reusingView:</code> data source method to return the ""00"" label. This is actually a bit tricky, since pickerview will alter the frame of this view to fill the row. That means you have to embed your properly positioned view inside another view, and then return that container view instead. </p>

<p>As for the labels, those are simply <code>UILabel</code> objects that have been positioned correctly and added as subviews of the pickerview itself. </p>

<p>And to get them to update correctly, just change their titles in the <code>pickerView:didSelectRow:inComponent:</code> method. </p>

"<p>I recently - very recently - started learning how to program for iOS, and have been stumped by what appears (to me) to be a blatant oversight in SQLite3. Let me qualify that by saying that prior to last week I had zero (practical) experience with Macs, Objective C, Xcode, iOS or SQLite, so I have no delusions about waltzing into field of tried-and-true tools and finding obvious errors on my first try. I assume there's a good explanation.</p>

<p>However, after spending the last few months using SQL Server, MySQL, and PostgreSQL, I was amazed to discover that SQLite doesn't have better functionality for adding parameters by name. Everything I could find online (documentation, forums [including SO]) says to assign parameters using their integer index, which seems like it would be a pain to maintain if you ever modify your queries. Even though you <em>can</em> name the parameters in your statements and do something like </p>

<pre><code>sqlite3_bind_int(stmt, sqlite3_bind_parameter_index(stmt, ""@my_param""), myInt);
</code></pre>

<p>no one seems to do that either. In fact, no one seems to try to automate this at all; the only <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5833630/sqlite3-insert-statement-doesnt-inserts-objective-c"">alternate approach</a> I could find used a parameter array and a loop counter, and inspected each parameter to determine which object type to insert. I originally considered a similar approach, but a) my boss's stance is that database parameters should always be type checked (and I agree, although I realize that SQLite fields aren't strongly typed and I technically could do it anyways), b) it felt like an inelegant hack, and c) I assumed there was a reason this approach wasn't widely used. So:</p>

<p>1) Why aren't there binding methods in SQLite that accept a parameter name (as, say, a 'const char')? Or are there and I'm missing something?</p>

<p>2) Why doesn't anyone seem to use an approach like the example above? </p>

<p>I dug in the source code a little and think I could easily modify the library or just write my own (typed) class methods that would do the above for me, but I'm assuming there's a reason no one has built this into SQLite yet. My only guess is that the additional memory and cycles needed to find  the parameter index are too precious on an [insert iDevice here], and aren't worth the convenience of being able to use parameter names . . . ?</p>

<p>Any insight would be appreciated.</p>

<li><p>There are; it's the <a href=""http://sqlite.org/c3ref/bind_parameter_index.html"" rel=""nofollow""><code>sqlite3_bind_parameter_index()</code></a> function you mentioned that you use to turn a parameter name into an index, which you can then use with the <a href=""http://sqlite.org/c3ref/bind_blob.html"" rel=""nofollow""><code>sqlite3_bind_*()</code></a> functions.  However, there's no <code>sqlite3_bind_*_by_name()</code> function or anything like that.  This is to help prevent API bloat.  The popular <a href=""http://github.com/ccgus/fmdb"" rel=""nofollow"">Flying Meat Database sqlite wrapper</a> has support for named parameters in one of its branches, if you're interested in seeing how it's used.</p>

<p>If you think about what it would take to implement full named parameter binding methods, consider the current list of <code>bind</code> functions:</p>

<pre><code>int sqlite3_bind_blob(sqlite3_stmt*, int, const void*, int n, void(*)(void*));
int sqlite3_bind_double(sqlite3_stmt*, int, double);
int sqlite3_bind_int(sqlite3_stmt*, int, int);
int sqlite3_bind_int64(sqlite3_stmt*, int, sqlite3_int64);
int sqlite3_bind_null(sqlite3_stmt*, int);
int sqlite3_bind_text(sqlite3_stmt*, int, const char*, int n, void(*)(void*));
int sqlite3_bind_text16(sqlite3_stmt*, int, const void*, int, void(*)(void*));
int sqlite3_bind_value(sqlite3_stmt*, int, const sqlite3_value*);
int sqlite3_bind_zeroblob(sqlite3_stmt*, int, int n);
</code></pre>

<p>If we wanted to add explicit support for named parameters, that list would double in length to include:</p>

<pre><code>int sqlite3_bind_name_blob(sqlite3_stmt*, const char*, const void*, int n, void(*)(void*));
int sqlite3_bind_name_double(sqlite3_stmt*, const char*, double);
int sqlite3_bind_name_int(sqlite3_stmt*, const char*, int);
int sqlite3_bind_name_int64(sqlite3_stmt*, const char*, sqlite3_int64);
int sqlite3_bind_name_null(sqlite3_stmt*, const char*);
int sqlite3_bind_name_text(sqlite3_stmt*, const char*, const char*, int n, void(*)(void*));
int sqlite3_bind_name_text16(sqlite3_stmt*, const char*, const void*, int, void(*)(void*));
int sqlite3_bind_name_value(sqlite3_stmt*, const char*, const sqlite3_value*);
int sqlite3_bind_name_zeroblob(sqlite3_stmt*, const char*, int n);
</code></pre>

<p>Twice as many functions means a lot more time spent maintaining API, ensuring backwards-compatibility, etc etc.  However, by simply introducing the <code>sqlite3_bind_parameter_index()</code>, they were able to add complete support for named parameters with only a <em>single</em> function.  This means that if they ever decide to support new bind types (maybe <code>sqlite3_bind_int128</code>?), they only have to add a single function, and not two.</p></li>
<li><p>As for why no one seems to use it... I can't give any sort of definitive answer with conducting a survey.  My <em>guess</em> would be that it's a bit more natural to refer to parameters sequentially, in which case named parameters aren't that useful.  Named parameters only seem to be useful if you need to refer to parameters out of order.</p></li>

- (NSNumber *)bar {
  return [[self userInfo] objectForKey:@""bar""];

<li>If a text field is selected first, the keyboard pops up. Vice versa for a date picker (which pops up with a similar animation).</li>

"<p>I'm using Xcode 4.2 to write and Clang 3.0 to build a program that demonstrates a particular crash.</p>

<p>The program has a window that it means to keep around that is set in the nib to “Release When Closed”, so it's over-released in subsequent uses. It's meant to be a sheet, so it's shown using <code>beginSheet:modalForWindow:modalDelegate:didEndSelector:contextInfo:</code>. Trying to show the window a second or third time should crash the app.</p>

<p>I remember that happening a year ago, with the program receiving <code>EXC_BAD_ACCESS</code> and that triggering the debugger to stop at that point. I also remember being able to hunt the problem down in Instruments using the Zombies template.</p>

<p>That's what I want (this program is part of a presentation to show debugging techniques), but that's not what's happening now. Now, the program doesn't crash; Instruments shows that the retain count on the window gets down to 1 twice, but no lower, so it does not get deallocated.</p>

<p>That would be fine if the problem stopped there; I could simply hide and show the sheet another time or two. The problem is, the second time I bring up the (should-be-dead-but-still-has-at-least-one-retain-keeping-it-alive) sheet, it's numb.</p>

<p>By that I mean that neither the sheet nor any control in it (it contains a field, a text view, and two buttons) responds to events. The heartbeat does nothing in it; the window has an OK button, but when the window is numb, the OK button does not pulse. Nothing works to dismiss the sheet.</p>

<p>But the program is not crashed. I can still interact with the menus and the Dock shows that the program is responding. If I try to quit it, it beeps, since it has a sheet up.</p>

<p>What's causing the window to go numb, and what can I do about it?</p>

<p>As for <em>why</em> they're different, I don't know.  But my experience has been to always use <code>-orderOut:</code> to dismiss sheets, and never <code>-close</code>.  <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/Sheets/Tasks/UsingCustomSheets.html"" rel=""nofollow"">The documentation backs me up on this:</a></p>

"<p>I am experimenting with some new properties in iOS 5 regarding <code>UIProgressView</code>. They are:</p>

<p><code>@property(nonatomic, retain) UIImage *progressImage;</code><br>
<code>@property(nonatomic, retain) UIImage *trackImage;</code></p>

<p>These new properties enable the customisation of the ""<em>progress</em>"" and the ""<em>track</em>"" image, so that you can make fancy progress bars without having to roll-your-own.</p>

<p>I however cannot understand how Apple ""<em>stretches</em>"" the progress images, because documentation is a little flakey / OR there is some standard I am not aware of. <strong>Regardless, I am asking if someone can help me understand how to make appropriate progress and tracking images.</strong></p>

<p>I get results like this when I load my custom images, no matter which sizes I try:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/6f10H.png"" alt=""Progress Example""></p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/feCkH.png"" alt=""The Tracking Image""> <code>trackImage.png</code></p>
","115730","","<p>Here's what's going on:</p>

<p>The images you provide to the <code>UIProgressView</code> are basically being shoved in to <code>UIImageViews</code>, and the <code>UIImageView</code> is stretching the image to fill the space.</p>

<p>If you simply do:</p>

<pre><code>[progressView setTrackImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@""track.png""]];
</code></pre>

<p>Then you're going to get weird results, because it's trying to stretch a 10px wide image to fill (for example) a 100px wide image view.  This means (roughly) that every pixel in the image will be repeated 10 times.  So if the pixels in our image were:</p>

<pre><code>0123456789
</code></pre>

<p>Then putting that image straight into a 100px wide image view would stretch it something like this:</p>

<pre><code>000000000011111111112222222222333333333344444444445555555555...

<pre><code>01234567812345678123456781234567812345678...123456789
</code></pre>

<p>In other words, you want the image to have a 1 point left edge that is never stretched, the center to be tiled, and to have a 1 point right edge that is also never stretched.  To do this, <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/uikit/reference/UIImage_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006890-CH3-SW50"">you'll need to make the image resizable</a>:</p>

<pre><code>UIImage *track = [[UIImage imageNamed:@""track""] resizableImageWithCapInsets:UIEdgeInsetsMake(0, 1, 0, 1)];
[progressView setTrackImage:track];
</code></pre>

<p>If you want this to tile appropriately vertically as well, then the edge insets should be <code>{1, 1, 1, 1}</code> (assuming you want a 1 point border).</p>

<p>Do the same to the <code>progressImage</code>, and you'll end up with something that looks correct:</p>

"<p>I have a UISegmentedControl whose ""Value changed"" event is wired up in Interface Builder to call my controller's <code>-(IBAction)segmentChangeAction:(id)sender;</code></p>

<p>When the user taps on the control to change the selected segment, as expected <code>segmentChangeAction</code> is called whether in iOS4 or iOS5.</p>

<p>When I programmatically change the selected segment through <code>segmentedControl.selectedSegmentIndex = newIndex;</code>, on iOS4 <code>segmentChangeAction</code> is called and the segment reflects the new selection. However on iOS5 <code>segmentChangeAction</code> is <em>not</em> called, yet the segment does reflect the new selection.</p>

<p>Is this a change in iOS5? Is there anything I can do to get <code>segmentChangeAction</code> called on iOS5 when I programmatically change the selection?</p>
","115730","","<p>This is a change in iOS 5 in order for <code>UISegmentedControl</code> to be consistent with all other controls.</p>

<p>The idea is that the action should only fired automatically as a result of user interaction.  Prior to iOS 5, <code>UISegmentedControl</code>'s actions would be fired because of user interaction <em>and</em> programmatic interaction.  However, initiating the change programmatically means that you can also do <code>[myControl sendActionsForControlEvents:UIControlEventValueChanged]</code> yourself.</p>

<p>However, you have to be careful with this.  Say you do:</p>

[segmentedControl sendActionsForControlEvents:UIControlEventValueChanged];

<p>The way around this is to do some sort of guard.  This could be a runtime check to indicate that you're running on an iOS 5+ device, or could even be something more mundane, like this:</p>

<pre><code>// changingIndex is a BOOL ivar
changingIndex = YES;
[segmentedControl setSelectedSegmentIndex:newIndex];
changingIndex = NO;
[segmentedControl sendActionsForControlEvents:UIControlEventValueChanged];

<p>As said, I'm looking for the number of hours past midnight. In the example above, that value should be <code>22</code>. I wanted to achieve this by creating an NSDateFormatter object and have it extract the hour of day in 24 hour clock format, thus using <code>setDateFormat:@""H""</code> (capital H rather than 'h'):</p>

<pre><code>NSDateFormatter *formatHour = [[NSDateFormatter alloc] init];
[formatHour setDateFormat:@""H""];
NSInteger intHoursPastMidnight = [[formatHour stringFromDate:returnTime] integerValue];

<p>This however does not always work as expected. When the user has disabled the 24 hour clock in the system wide Preferences (i.e. the user uses AM/PM), <code>intHoursPastMidnight</code> will contain <code>10</code> rather than <code>22</code>. <code>10</code> is indeed the value that's visible in the <code>UIDatePicker</code>, but I had expected <code>NSDateFormatter</code> to convert this to <code>22</code> because of <code>@""H""</code>.</p>

<p>What's wrong here? Is my convert assumption incorrect? Is this a bug with UIDatePicker? How can I solve the problem, so I can essentially access the number of hours past midnight set in the UIDatePicker, independent from the user's 12 or 24 hour clock preference?

","115730","","<p>Yes, but it looks like it's going to be a bit of work.</p>

<p>When you get an <code>EDAMResource</code> that corresponds to an image, it has a property called <code>recognition</code> that returns an <code>EDAMData</code> object that contains the XML that defines the recognition info.  For example, I attached this image to a note:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/SlOYZ.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I inspected the <code>recognition</code> info that was attached to the corresponding <code>EDAMResource</code> object, and found this:</p>

<p><a href=""http://pastie.org/2854227"" rel=""nofollow"">the xml i found on pastie.org, because it's too big to fit in an answer</a></p>

<p>As you can see, there's a LOT of information here.  The XML is defined in <a href=""http://www.evernote.com/about/developer/api/evernote-api.htm#_Toc297053078"" rel=""nofollow"">the API documentation</a>, so this would be where you parse the XML and extract the relevant information yourself.  Fortunately, the structure of the XML is quite simple (you could write a parser in a few minutes).  The hard part will be to figure out what parts you want to use.</p>

","115730","","<p>Both of the other answers are wrong, because they do not account for daylight savings time.  To do that, you have to use <code>NSDateComponents</code> and <code>NSCalendar</code>:</p>

NSDate *endDate = ...;
NSDateComponents *diff = [[NSDateComponents alloc] init];

  tmp = [cal dateByAddingComponents:diff toDate:startDate options:0];
  [dates addObject:tmp];
}

<p>In this code, I'm not actually running the <code>NSDate</code> objects through the <code>NSDateFormatter</code>, because that should happen at a different level.  This code is all about the underlying data (the Model), and <code>NSDateFormatter</code> usually operates at the user-visible level (the View).  Plus, it's generally more useful to have the raw data object than the formatted string.</p>

<li><p>Does LLVM automatically convert Objective-C methods to inline functions when possible?</p>

<p>(I.e., is it just as performant to create an Objective-C method for a block of code that you could otherwise paste inline?)</p></li>
<li><p>If LLVM doesn't perform this optimization, why not? If it does, (a) are there certain build settings I must set for this to happen? (b) How can I tell if an Objective-C method will be inlined?</p></li>
</ol>
","115730","","<p>Let's assume for a moment that the compiler inlines a method:</p>

<pre><code>@implementation AwesomeClass 

- (void)doFoo OBJC_INLINE { // or some way to indicate ""this is an inline method""
  NSLog(@""doing foo!"");
}

- (void)doBar {
  [self doAwesomeStuff];
  [self doFoo];
}

<p>so that <code>-doBar</code> essentially becomes:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)doBar {
  [self doAwesomeStuff];
  {
    NSLog(@""doing foo!"");
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Awesome, that seems like it'd be faster, right?  We save ourselves a whole dozen instructions by not calling <code>objc_msgSend</code>.  So you package this up and post it online as a .a file.</p>

<p>NSCleverCoder comes along and says ""but I want <code>doFoo</code> to do a little bit more"", so he does:</p>

<pre><code>@interface SuperAwesomeClass : AwesomeClass @end
@implementation SuperAwesomeClass
- (void)doFoo {
  NSLog(@""doing more foo!"");
  [super doFoo];
}
@end
</code></pre>

<p>When he tries to run this, <em>it never gets called</em>, because <code>AwesomeClass</code> never actually invokes the <code>-doFoo</code> method.</p>

<p>""But,"" you say, ""this is a contrived example!""</p>

<p>No, it's not.  In Objective-C, it is perfectly legal to do this at any point in the development or execution of an app.  I can do this when writing the code.  Heck, I can even do this at runtime by using <code>objc_allocateClassPair</code> and <code>class_addMethod</code> to dynamically create a subclass and add a method override.</p>

<p>I can also swizzle method implementations.  Don't like the existing implementation of <code>-doFoo</code>? That's cool; replace it with your own.  Oh wait; if the method was inlined, your new implementation would never get called, because <code>-doBar</code> is never actually invoking the <code>-doFoo</code> method.</p>

<p>The <strong>only</strong> time I could see this being possible is if there were some sort of way to annotate a method as being un-overridable. <a href=""http://filearadar.com"">But there's no way to do that</a>, so that issue is moot.  And <em>even then</em>, it would still be a bad idea; just because the compiler doesn't let you do it doesn't mean you can't still work around it at runtime.  And again, you'd run in to problems.</p>

  <p>In iOS 5, the <code>UINavigationBar</code>, <code>UIToolbar</code>, and <code>UITabBar</code> implementations have changed so that the <code>drawRect:</code> method is not called unless it is implemented in a subclass. Apps that have re-implemented <code>drawRect:</code> in a category on any of these classes will find that the <code>drawRect:</code> method isn't called. UIKit does link-checking to keep the method from being called in apps linked before iOS 5 but does not support this design on iOS 5 or later. Apps can either:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Use the customization API for bars in iOS 5 and later, which is the preferred way.</li>

"<p>I conducted a quick test with the Cocoa Touch to see how NSHebrewCalendar works. I'm particularly interested in the month numbers. I used a date picker to easily change dates, and I passed it in to a method which logs the hebrew date, the hebrew month number, the hebrew year, and if the year is leap year. That looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>BOOL isHebrewLeapYear = [self.calendar isHebrewLeapYear:[calendar hebrewYearForDate:[self.calendar workingDate]]];

NSLog(@""Hebrew Date:%@, Month Number: %i, %i is Leap Year: %i"", [self.calendar stringFromHebrewDate:[self.calendar workingDate]], [self.calendar hebrewMonthNumberFromDate:[self.calendar workingDate]], [calendar hebrewYearForDate:[self.calendar workingDate]], isHebrewLeapYear);    
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>self.calendar</code> object is a custom class. The <code>workingDate</code> property is an <code>NSDate</code> instance. Here are the relevant method declarations. </p>

<pre><code>//  Check if a given year is a leap year
- (BOOL) isHebrewLeapYear:(NSInteger)year{
    return ((7 * year + 1) % 19) &lt; 7;
}

//Get the hebrew year for a given date
- (NSInteger) hebrewYearForDate:(NSDate *)date{
   NSCalendar *hebrewCalendar = [[[NSCalendar alloc] initWithCalendarIdentifier:NSHebrewCalendar] autorelease];
   return [[hebrewCalendar components:NSYearCalendarUnit fromDate:date] year];
}

- (NSInteger) hebrewMonthNumberFromDate:(NSDate *)date{
    NSCalendar *hebrewCalendar = [[[NSCalendar alloc] initWithCalendarIdentifier:NSHebrewCalendar] autorelease];
    return [[hebrewCalendar components:NSMonthCalendarUnit fromDate:date] month];
}
</code></pre>

<p>Apparently hebrew leap years are handled as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Month numbering starts at 1, with that month being ""Tishri"".</li>
<li>In a nonleap year, Adar is month number 7, not 6. </li>
<li>In a leap year, Adar I is number 6 and Adar II is 7. </li>
<li>""Nisan"" is always 8 and so on until ""Elul"", which is always 13.</li>
</ul>

<p>Does it sound like my experiment is producing accurate results? Is this behavior documented anywhere? </p>
","115730","","<blockquote>

<p>So what's up with Adar in non-leap years?  I ran this code to find out:</p>

<pre><code>@autoreleasepool {

    NSDate *today = [NSDate date];
    NSCalendar *hebrew = [[NSCalendar alloc] initWithCalendarIdentifier:NSHebrewCalendar];
    NSDateComponents *diff = [[NSDateComponents alloc] init];

    [f setDateFormat:@""d MMMM y""];
    [f setCalendar:hebrew];

    for (NSInteger i = 0; i &lt; 19; ++i) {
        NSDateComponents *comp = [[NSDateComponents alloc] init];
        [comp setYear:5772 + i];
        [comp setDay:1];

        NSLog(@""============= %d ============"", [comp year]);

        for (NSInteger i = 1; i &lt;= 13; ++i) {
            [comp setMonth:i];

            NSDate *d = [hebrew dateFromComponents:comp];
            NSLog(@""%d: %@ (%@)"", i, [f stringFromDate:d], d);
        }
    }

}

"<p>What is the smartest way to build a query with <code>NSString</code>, when the parameter count is variable?</p>

","115730","","<p>My initial reaction:</p>

<p>Allocating an <code>NSDateFormatter</code> isn't a cheap prospect.  In your case, you're using the same format string over and over again, so you should REALLY just be allocating a single <code>NSDateFormatter</code>, saving it as an instance variable, and then using that when the <code>UIDatePicker</code> action fires.  That should speed things up considerably.</p>

But, is there a way to implement it and benefit from the existing NSPredicate classes?  Since operators were defined as an <code>enum</code>, I doubt I can extend on that front.  Or am I completely missing the boat on this?!</p>

"<p>I have a string called realEstateWorth with a value of $12,000,000.
I need this same string to remain a string but for any number (such as the one above) to be displayed as $12 MILLION or $6 MILLION. The point is it needs the words ""MILLION"" to come after the number.</p>

<p>I know there is nsNumberFormatter that can convert strings into numbers and vice versa but can it do what I need? </p>

<p>If anyone has any ideas or suggestions, it would be much appreciated. </p>

<p>Thank you!</p>
","115730","","<p>So as I see it, you have two problems:</p>

<ol>
<li>You have a string representation of something that's actually a number</li>
<li>You (potentially) have a number that you want formatted as a string</li>
</ol>

<p>So, problem #1:</p>

<p>To convert a string into a number, you use an <code>NSNumberFormatter</code>.  You've got a pretty simple case:</p>

<pre><code>NSNumberFormatter *f = [[NSNumberFormatter alloc] init];
[f setNumberStyle:NSNumberFormatterCurrencyStyle];
NSNumber *n = [f numberFromString:@""$12,000,000""];
// n is 12000000
</code></pre>

<p>That was easy!  Now problem #2:</p>

<p>This is trickier, because you want a mixed spell-out style.  You could consider using an <code>NSNumberFormatter</code> again, but it's not quite right:</p>

<pre><code>[f setNumberStyle:NSNumberFormatterSpellOutStyle];
NSString *s = [f stringFromNumber:n];
// s is ""twelve million""
</code></pre>

<p>So, we're closer.  At this point, you could perhaps maybe do something like:</p>

<pre><code>NSInteger numberOfMillions = [n integerValue] / 1000000;
if (numberOfMillions &gt; 0) {
  NSNumber *millions = [NSNumber numberWithInteger:numberOfMillions];
  NSString *numberOfMillionsString = [f stringFromNumber:millions]; // ""twelve""

  [f setNumberStyle:NSNumberFormatterCurrencyStyle];
  NSString *formattedMillions = [f stringFromNumber:millions]; // ""$12.00""

  if ([s hasPrefix:numberOfMillionsString]) {
    // replace ""twelve"" with ""$12.00""
    s = [s stringByReplacingCharactersInRange:NSMakeRange(0, [numberOfMillionsString length]) withString:formattedMillions];

    // if this all works, s should be ""$12.00 million""
    // you can use the -setMaximumFractionDigits: method on NSNumberFormatter to fiddle with the "".00"" bit
  }
}
</code></pre>

"<p>Is there a function in the IOS Api that is like substringFromIndex excepts uses a lot less memory (I am using VERY VERY large strings). If I would have to make that function how would I go about doing that?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance</p>
","115730","","<p>Yes, but it's kind of roundabout and potentially dangerous</p>

<p>Here's what you do:</p>

<pre><code>NSString *veryLargeString = ...;
NSUInteger startingIndex = ...;
NSData *veryLargeStringData = [veryLargeString dataUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];

const void *bytes = [veryLargeStringData bytes];
const void *subBytes = bytes + startingIndex;
NSUInteger subLength = [veryLargeStringData length] - startingIndex;

NSString *substring = [[NSString alloc] initWithBytesNoCopy:subBytes length:subLength encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding freeWhenDone:NO];
</code></pre>

<p>What is this doing:</p>

<ol>
<li>It's getting the very large string as a series of bytes; I'm <em>pretty</em> sure this doesn't actually copy the bytes, but be sure to use Instruments to verify.  If you can get this super long string as an <code>NSData</code> to begin with instead of an <code>NSString</code>, then you can be much more confident that nothing's going to get copied.</li>
<li>Get the actual byte buffer from the <code>NSData</code></li>
<li>Index into the byte buffer by using some pointer arithmetic</li>
<li>Figure out how much of the buffer is left</li>
<li>Create a new <code>NSString</code> with the byte buffer, but telling it to <em>NOT</em> copy the bytes, and to <em>NOT</em> free the buffer when the <code>NSString</code> is deallocated</li>
</ol>

<p>So, why is this dangerous?  Basically, if the byte buffer disappears from underneath the <code>NSStrings</code>, Bad Things™ can happen (likely crashing).</p>

<p>However, if you're smart about it, this will allow you to create substrings without copying the underlying bytes.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Devious thought</strong>:</p>

<p>You could make <code>veryLargeString</code> a retained associated object on <code>substring</code> (i.e., basically make <code>substring</code> an owner of <code>veryLargeString</code>).  This would ensure that <code>veryLargeString</code> lives at least as long as <code>substring</code> does.  You'd do that like this:</p>

<pre><code>static char ParentStringKey;

objc_setAssociatedObject(substring, &amp;ParentStringKey, veryLargeString, OBJC_ASSOCIATION_RETAIN);
</code></pre>

<p>When <code>substring</code> is deallocated, it'll also automatically release its retain on <code>veryLargeString</code>.</p>

","115730","","<p>This is similar to Alex's answer, but it looks like his only gets days from the start of the month to whatever day it is today.  Here's how you can get all of the days this month:</p>

NSCalendar *cal = [NSCalendar currentCalendar];

NSMutableArray *datesThisMonth = [NSMutableArray array];
NSRange rangeOfDaysThisMonth = [cal rangeOfUnit:NSDayCalendarUnit inUnit:NSMonthCalendarUnit forDate:today];

NSDateComponents *components = [cal components:(NSDayCalendarUnit | NSMonthCalendarUnit | NSYearCalendarUnit | NSEraCalendarUnit) fromDate:today];
[components setHour:0];
[components setMinute:0];
[components setSecond:0];

for (NSInteger i = rangeOfDaysThisMonth.location; i &lt; NSMaxRange(rangeOfDaysThisMonth); ++i) {
  [components setDay:i];
  NSDate *dayInMonth = [cal dateFromComponents:components];
  [datesThisMonth addObject:dayInMonth];
}

<p>This will leave with with an <code>NSArray</code> of <code>NSDates</code>, with one date per day in the current month.</p>

[diff setDay:-17];

NSDate *seventeenDaysAgo = [cal dateByAddingComponents:diff toDate:today];

"<p>Is it possible to substitute reserved words, specifically <code>OR</code> and <code>AND</code>, into a <code>predicateFormat</code>?</p>

<p>I tried:</p>

<pre><code>NSString *andOr = (isAnd ? @""AND"" : @""OR"");  // isAnd is a BOOL variable
NSPredicate *predicate = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:

reason: 'Unable to parse the format string ""firstName == %@ %K lastName == %@""

<p>I tried <code>%s</code> (and also <code>%S</code>) instead of <code>%K</code> but got the same exception.</p>

It supports <a href=""https://github.com/davedelong/DDMathParser/wiki/Operators"" rel=""nofollow"">all of the standard mathematical operators</a>, including logical and comparison operators (<code>||</code>, <code>&amp;&amp;</code>, <code>==</code>, <code>!=</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, etc).</p>

<p>In your case, you'd do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>NSNumber *result = [@""15+14 == 23"" numberByEvaluatingString];
if ([result boolValue] == YES) {
  ....True statement....
} else {
  .....False statement.....

","115730","","<p>Session 108 of WWDC 2011 was called ""iOS Printing System"" and included a deep walkthrough of all the ways to print in iOS, including a demo of creating a custom <code>UIPrintPageRenderer</code>, which is (most likely) what you'd need to do.</p>

<p>You can get the video, sample code, and slides from the Apple developer site: <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2011/?id=108"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2011/?id=108</a></p>

"<p>I'm trying to write a predicate to check a specific value in a dictionary I have set up.</p>

<p>This dictionary has string versions of ""0"", ""1"", and ""2"" as keys which I would like to access.</p>

<p>The predicate I would like to write is:</p>

<p>$player.currencyDictionaries.0.earned > 1000</p>

<p>The problem is that .0 is not allowed.  Assuming I cannot easily change how the dictionary stores values (this is in older versions and I'd like to use the same predicate on all versions as it is hosted on a server) is there any way to access the data?</p>
","115730","","<p>IIRC, you can do this:</p>

<pre><code>$player.currencyDictionaries[0].earned &gt; 1000
</code></pre>

<p>(You might need to do <code>['0']</code> to guarantee that the passed value is a string and not a number)</p>

<p>Note that this syntax (<code>[0]</code>) <em>only</em> works in predicate format strings.  It does not work with key paths.</p>

<p>This syntax is defined under the ""<a href=""http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/Predicates/Articles/pBNF.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001796-217950"" rel=""nofollow"">Index Expression</a>"" section of the Predicate BNF.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>Actually, this won't work, and here's why:</p>

<p>The string <code>""$player.currencyDictionaries[0].earned""</code> will be read and turned into an <code>NSExpression</code> of type <code>NSKeyPathExpression</code>. This means, when it's evaluated, it's going to basically take that string and run it through the receiver's <code>-valueForKeyPath:</code> method.  As I mentioned above, the bracket syntax doesn't work with key paths, and thus this will produce the incorrect answer.</p>

<p>However, since you know the <code>currencyDictionaries</code> returns an <code>NSDictionary</code>, and since <code>NSDictionary</code> <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/nsdictionary_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000140-BBCIBCDJ"" rel=""nofollow"">overrides the <code>-valueForKey:</code> method</a>, you can turn the <code>[0]</code> bit into a key path, by turning it into a literal string:</p>

<pre><code>$player.currencyDictionaries.'0'.earned

"<p>I want to get the name of the arguments of the current function I am in so that I can prepare loading that object from the filesystem if it's not present on the current instance. (for instance if [foo dictTest] is not available I want to load it's prior saved plist version into exactly that ivar) </p>

<p>I want to find the file by providing the ivar name that I provided as an argument to the current function.</p>

<p>This is the function code:</p>

<pre><code>-(NSDictionary*)getCachedDictionary:(NSDictionary*)dict{

    NSInvocation *invocation = [NSInvocation invocationWithMethodSignature:[self methodSignatureForSelector:_cmd]];
    NSString * firstArgument = nil;

<p>As soon as the code reaches the NSLog I am getting a null value from firstArgument.</p>

<p>Why is that? Could it be possible that I would have to wait for the complete invocation of that current method I am in or is it actually better to create a proxy function that implicitly calls my class method via an invocation that eats the ivar name provided by setArgument so that I can use that argument string like I want?</p>

<p>Thanks a lot in advance!</p>

<p>P.S.: In this particular example I do not want to use KVC to identify the ivar and return it.</p>
","115730","","<p>You've misunderstood the <code>NSInvocation</code> API.  <code>+[NSInvocation invocationWithMethodSignature:]</code> creates a new <code>NSInvocation</code> that is keyed to accept arguments of the types defined by the method signature.  It does <em>not</em> return an <code>NSInvocation</code> that corresponds to the current method invocation.  This is pretty easy to see why:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)doBar:(id)bip {
  NSLog(@""hi there!"")
}

- (void)doFoo {
  NSMethodSignature *sig = [self methodSignatureForSelector:@selector(doBar:)];
  NSInvocation *i = [NSInvocation invocationWithMethodSignature:sig];
}
</code></pre>

<p>When you create the invocation in <code>doFoo</code> for the <code>doBar:</code> method, it's obvious to see that the arguments <em>must</em> be empty, because <code>doBar:</code> hasn't been executed, and thus there is no argument.  Changing <code>@selector(doBar:)</code> to <code>_cmd</code> wouldn't magically change anything.</p>

<p>So the next question: <em>is</em> there a way to get an <code>NSInvocation</code> for the current method invocation?  Not that I know of.  <code>NSInvocation</code> is an extremely complicated class, and constructing one from the current method would be a nightmare.</p>

<p>I strongly suggest finding a different approach to do whatever it is you want to do.</p>

"<p><strong>Task:</strong></p>

<p>I am planning to parse a formula string in NSPredicate and to replace variables in the string by their numeric values. The variables are names for properties of existing object instances in my data model, for instance I have a class ""company"" with an instance ""Apple Corp."" </p>

<p><strong>Set-up:</strong></p>

<p>My formula would like look like this: ""Profitability_2011_in% = [Profit 2011] / [Revenue 2011]""</p>

<p>The instance ""Apple Corp"" would have the following properties: </p>

<p>Revenue 2009 = 10, Revenue 2010 = 20, Revenue 2011 = 30, 
Profit 2009 = 5, Profit 2010 = 10, Profit 2011 = 20. </p>

<p>Hence, the formula would yield 20 / 30 = 67%.</p>

<p>Variables are usually two-dimensional, for instance defined by ""profit"" as the financial statement item and ""year"" (for instance 2011). 
The variables are enclosed in [ ] and the dimensions are separated by "" "" (whitespace).</p>

<p><strong>How I would do it</strong></p>

<p>My implementation would begin with NSRegularExpression's <code>matchesInString:options:range:</code> to get an array of all variables in the formula (Profit 2011, Revenue 2011) and then construct an NSDictionary (key = variable name) out of this array by querying my data model.</p>

<p><strong>What do you think?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Is there a better way to do it in your view? </li>
<li>In the formula, how would you replace the variables by their values?</li>
<li>How would you parse the formula?</li>
</ul>

<p>Thank you!!</p>
","115730","","<p>Yes, you can do this.  This falls under the category of ""Using <code>NSPredicate</code> for things for which it was not intended"", but will work just fine.</p>

<p>You'll need to replace your variables with a single word that start with a <code>$</code>, since that's how <code>NSPredicate</code> denotes variables:</p>

<pre><code>NSPredicate *p = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@""foo = $bar""];
</code></pre>

<p>However you want to do that, great.  <code>NSRegularExpression</code> is a fine way to do that.</p>

<p>Once you do that, you'll have something like this:</p>

<pre><code>@""$profitability2011 = $profit2011 / $revenue2011""
</code></pre>

<p>You can then pop this through <code>+predicateWithFormat:</code>.  You'll get back an <code>NSComparisonPredicate</code>.  The <code>-leftExpression</code> will be of type <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/DOCUMENTATION/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSExpression_Class/Reference/NSExpression.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001190-SW30"" rel=""nofollow""><code>NSVariableExpressionType</code></a>, and the <code>-rightExpression</code> will be of type <code>NSFunctionExpressionType</code>.</p>

<p>This is where things start to get hairy.  If you were to <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/DOCUMENTATION/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSPredicate_Class/Reference/NSPredicate.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001187-SW1"" rel=""nofollow""><code>-evaluteWithObject:substitutionVariables:</code></a>, you'd simply get back a <code>YES</code> or <code>NO</code> value, since a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predicate_%28mathematical_logic%29"" rel=""nofollow"">predicate is simply a statement that evaluates to true or false</a>.  I haven't explored how you could just evaluate one side (in this case, the <code>-rightExpression</code>), but it's possible that <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/DOCUMENTATION/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSExpression_Class/Reference/NSExpression.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001190-CJBCGCEJ"" rel=""nofollow""><code>-[NSExpression expressionValueWithObject:context:]</code></a> might help you.  I don't know, because I'm not sure what that ""context"" parameter is for.  It doesn't <em>seem</em> like it's a substitution dictionary, but I could be wrong.</p>

<p>So if that doesn't work (and I have no idea if it will or not), you could use my parser: <a href=""https://github.com/davedelong/DDMathParser"" rel=""nofollow"">DDMathParser</a>.  It has a parser, similar to <code>NSPredicate</code>'s parser, but is specifically tuned for parsing and evaluating mathematical expressions.  In your case, you'd do:</p>

<pre><code>#import ""DDMathParser.h""

NSString *s = @""$profit2011 / $revenue2011"";
NSDictionary *values = ...; // the values of the variables
NSNumber *profitability = [s numberByEvaluatingStringWithSubstitutions:values];

<hr>

<p><strong>edit</strong> Dynamic variable resolution</p>

<p>I just pushed a change that allows DDMathParser to resolve functions dynamically.  It's important to understand that a function is different from a variable.  A function is evaluated, whereas a variable is simply substituted.  However, the change only does dynamic resolution for <em>functions</em>, not variables.  That's ok, because DDMathParser has this neat thing called <a href=""https://github.com/davedelong/DDMathParser/wiki/Argumentless-Functions"" rel=""nofollow"">argumentless functions</a>.</p>

<p>An argumentless function is a function name that's not followed by an opening parenthesis.  For convenience, it's inserted for you.  This means that <code>@""pi""</code> is correctly parsed as <code>@""pi()""</code> (since the constant for &pi; is implemented as a function).</p>

<p>In your case, you can do this:</p>

<p>Instead of regexing your string to make variables, simply use the names of the terms:</p>

<pre><code>@""profit_2011 / revenue_2011"";
</code></pre>

<p>This will be parsed as if you had entered:</p>

<pre><code>@""divide(profit_2011(), revenue_2011())""
</code></pre>

<p>You can the set up your <code>DDMathEvaluator</code> object with a function resolver.  There are two examples of this in the <code>DDMathParser</code> repository:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href=""https://github.com/davedelong/DDMathParser/blob/b132b37491cfc1ae4fbb34d0c706ec18e434b5e4/Demo/DemoController.m#L43"" rel=""nofollow"">This example</a> shows how to use the resolver function to look up the ""missing"" function in a substitution dictionary (this would be most like what you want)</li>

</ol>

NSArray *filtered = [dataRows filteredArrayUsingPredicate:p];
</code></pre>

<p>So let's see what this predicate is doing.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Start with the outer-most level:</p>

<pre><code>SUBQUERY([stuff]).@count &gt; 0
</code></pre>

<p>A <code>SUBQUERY</code> returns an array of objects.  We're going to run this <code>SUBQUERY</code> on every <code>NSDictionary</code> in the <code>dataRows</code> array, and we want to aggregate all of the dictionaries where the <code>SUBQUERY</code> on that dictionary returns <em>something</em>.  So we run the <code>SUBQUERY</code>, and then (since it returns a collection), ask it for how many items were in it (<code>.@count</code>) and see if that's greater than 0.  If it is, then the top-level dictionary will be in the final filtered array.</p></li>
<li><p>Dig in to the <code>SUBQUERY</code>:</p>

<pre><code>SUBQUERY(row_values, $rv, $rv.property_id = %@ AND $rv.property_value = %@)
</code></pre>

<p>There are three parameters to every <code>SUBQUERY</code>: A key path, a variable, and a predicate.  The key path is the property of the object that we're going to be iterating.  Since the <code>SUBQUERY</code> is being evaluated on the outer-most dictionaries, we're going to ask for the <code>@""row_values""</code> of that dictionary and get back an array.  The <code>SUBQUERY</code> will then iterate over the items in the <code>row_values</code> collection.</p>

<p>The variable is what we're going to call each item in the collection. In this case, it's simply going to be <code>$rv</code> (shorthand for ""row value"").  In our case, each <code>$rv</code> will be an <code>NSDictionary</code>, since the <code>row_values</code> ""property"" is an array of dictionaries.</p>

<p>Finally, the predicate is going to be executed, with the <code>$rv</code> getting replaced for each dictionary in turn.  In this case, we want to see if the dictionary has a certain <code>property_id</code> and a certain <code>property_value</code>.  <em>If it does</em>, it will be aggregated into a new array, <strong>and that is the array that will be returned from the <code>SUBQUERY</code></strong>.</p>

<p>So to say it a different way, the <code>SUBQUERY</code> is going to build an array of all the row_values that have a <code>property_id</code> and <code>property_value</code> of what we're looking for.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>And finally, when I run this code, I get:</p>

<pre><code>(
        {
        row = 1;
        ""row_values"" =         (
                        {
                ""property_id"" = 47cc67093475061e01000542;
                ""property_value"" = ""Mr."";

                ""property_id"" = 47cc67093475061e01000540;
                ""property_value"" = Male;
            }

"<p>is it possible to do something like this in objective-c (using categories or something similar):

<p>One solution would be to put Node as a member variable to Element, but then i would have to write all the wrapper functions for Node class. Is it possible to extend it somehow?</p>

<p>thanks!</p>
","115730","","<p>This used to be possible, but the necessary function (<code>class_setSuperclass</code>) was deprecated a long time ago and cannot be used anymore (which is probably a good thing).</p>

<p>There are a couple of different ways to go about this, some better than others.</p>

<p>The best, I think, would be to make a new <code>Element</code> subclass, called <code>SpriteElement</code>, which has a <code>Sprite</code> member variable, and then forwards on all the relevant sprite-ly methods to the internal <code>Sprite</code> instance.</p>

<p>You could also define a new protocol that captures all of the things you want about a <code>Sprite</code>, like so:</p>

<pre><code>@protocol Sprite &lt;NSObject&gt;

- (void)doSpritelyThing;

@end
</code></pre>

<p>(I'm assuming that the <code>Sprite</code> class declares a <code>-doSpritelyThing</code> method)</p>

<p>Then, with a category, you could declare that the <code>Element</code> class conforms to the <code>&lt;Sprite&gt;</code> protocol:</p>

<pre><code>@interface Element (Sprite) &lt;Sprite&gt;

@end
</code></pre>

<p>And them implement the method like so:</p>

<pre><code>@implement Element (Sprite)

- (void)doSpritelyThing {
  ...
}

@end
</code></pre>

<p>You would probably also want to declare that the <code>Sprite</code> class conforms to the <code>Sprite</code> protocol:</p>

<pre><code>@interface Sprite () &lt;Sprite&gt;

@end
</code></pre>

<p>Then in your code, instead of declaring your variables as type <code>Element *</code>, you'd declare them as <code>id&lt;Sprite&gt;</code> (any object that understands messages from the <code>&lt;Sprite&gt;</code> protocol).</p>

<hr>

<p>The first approach is fine if you can be flexible with an <code>Element</code> being a different instance from a <code>Sprite</code>.  If you can't, then the second approach works great, too.</p>

","115730","","<p>Here's the crux of your problem:</p>

<pre><code>@""isSync == 0 AND SUBQUERY(toBookOrders, $x, $x.toBook == SELF)""

<p>If you split that up into the two subpredicates, as Scott suggests, you'll get:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>isSync == 0</code></li>
<li><code>SUBQUERY(toBookOrders, $x, $x.toBook == SELF)</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The problem is that every <code>SUBQUERY</code> does not return true or false, as a predicate must.  It returns a collection (an array), and an array is not the same thing as true or false.  Thus, when you create the predicate, you're getting an error that it's an invalid format, because the stuff after the <code>AND</code> <em>isn't a predicate</em>.  It's simply an expression.</p>

<p>You're <em>probably</em> wanting:</p>

<pre><code>@""isSync == 0 AND SUBQUERY(toBookOrders, $x, $x.toBook == SELF).@count &gt; 0""

<p>This would give you a predicate to find all the books where <code>isSync</code> is false and the at least one of the Book's <code>OrderBooks</code> is that Book.</p>

","115730","","<p>You can't do this with a predicate.  (Well, you <em>could</em>, but it would be stupidly complex, difficult to understand and maintain, and in the end it would be easier to write the code yourself)</p>

<p><code>NSPredicate</code> is for extracting a subset of data from an existing set. It only* does filtering, because a predicate is simply a statement that evaluates to true or false.  If you have a collection and <em>filter</em> it with a predicate, then what happens is the collection starts iterating over its elements and asks the predicate: ""does this pass your test?""  ""does this pass your test?""  ""does this pass your test?""...  Every time that the predicate answers ""yes this passes my test"", the collection adds that object to a new collection.  It is that new collection that is returned from the filter method.</p>

<p><strong>THUS</strong>:</p>

<p><code>NSPredicate</code> does not (easily) allow for merging two sets of data (which is what you're asking for).  It is possible (because you can do pretty much anything with a <code>FUNCTION()</code> expression), but it makes for inherently unreadable predicates.</p>

<p>I'm going to give this a shot, and I'll post as I find out, but please post if you know anything.</p>
","115730","","<p>First off, thanks for filing the bug about <code>UIDatePicker</code> and the Hebrew calendar. :)</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> Now that iOS 6 has been released, you'll find that <code>UIDatePicker</code> now works correctly with the Hebrew calendar, making the code below unnecessary.  However, I'll leave it for posterity.</p>

<hr>

<p>As you've discovered, creating a functioning date picker is a difficult problem, because there are bajillions of weird edge cases to cover.  The Hebrew calendar is particularly weird in this regard, having an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercalation"">intercalary <em>month</em></a> (Adar I), whereas most of western civilization is used to a calendar that only adds an extra day about once every 4 years.</p>

<p>That being said, creating a minimal Hebrew date picker isn't too complex, assuming you're willing to forego some of the niceties that <code>UIDatePicker</code> offers.  So let's make it simple:</p>

<pre><code>@interface HPDatePicker : UIPickerView

@property (nonatomic, retain) NSDate *date;

- (void)setDate:(NSDate *)date animated:(BOOL)animated;

@end
</code></pre>

<p>We're simply going to subclass <code>UIPickerView</code> and add support for a <code>date</code> property.  We're going to ignore <code>minimumDate</code>, <code>maximumDate</code>, <code>locale</code>, <code>calendar</code>, <code>timeZone</code>, and all the other fun properties that <code>UIDatePicker</code> provides.  This will make our job <em>much</em> simpler.</p>

<p>The implementation is going to start off with a class extension:</p>

<pre><code>@interface HPDatePicker () &lt;UIPickerViewDelegate, UIPickerViewDataSource&gt;

@end
</code></pre>

<p>Simply to hide that the <code>HPDatePicker</code> is its own delegate and datasource.</p>

<p>Next we'll define a couple of handy constants:</p>

<pre><code>#define LARGE_NUMBER_OF_ROWS 10000

#define MONTH_COMPONENT 0
#define DAY_COMPONENT 1
#define YEAR_COMPONENT 2
</code></pre>

<p>You can see here that we're going to hard-code the order of the calendar units.  In other words, this date picker will always display things as Month-Day-Year, regardless of any customizations or locale settings that the user may have.  So if you're using this in a locale where the default format would want ""Day-Month-Year"", then too bad.  For this simple example, this will suffice.</p>

<p>Now we start the implementation:</p>

<pre><code>@implementation HPDatePicker {
    NSCalendar *hebrewCalendar;
    NSDateFormatter *formatter;

    NSRange maxDayRange;
    NSRange maxMonthRange;
}

- (id)initWithFrame:(CGRect)frame
{
    self = [super initWithFrame:frame];
    if (self) {
        // Initialization code
        [self setDelegate:self];
        [self setDataSource:self];

        [self setShowsSelectionIndicator:YES];

        hebrewCalendar = [[NSCalendar alloc] initWithCalendarIdentifier:NSHebrewCalendar];
        formatter = [[NSDateFormatter alloc] init];
        [formatter setCalendar:hebrewCalendar];

        maxDayRange = [hebrewCalendar maximumRangeOfUnit:NSDayCalendarUnit];
        maxMonthRange = [hebrewCalendar maximumRangeOfUnit:NSMonthCalendarUnit];

        [self setDate:[NSDate date]];
    }
    return self;
}

- (void)dealloc {
    [hebrewCalendar release];
    [formatter release];
    [super dealloc];
}
</code></pre>

<p>We're overriding the designated initializer to do some setup for us.  We set the delegate and datasource to be ourself, show the selection indicator, and create a hebrew calendar object.  We also create an <code>NSDateFormatter</code> and tell it that it should format <code>NSDates</code> according to the hebrew calendar.  We also pull out a couple of <code>NSRange</code> objects and cache them as ivars so we don't have to constantly be looking things up.  Finally, we initialize it with the current date.</p>

<p>Here are the implementations of the exposed methods:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)setDate:(NSDate *)date {
    [self setDate:date animated:NO];
}
</code></pre>

<p><code>-setDate:</code> just forwards on to the other method</p>

<pre><code>- (NSDate *)date {
    NSDateComponents *c = [self selectedDateComponents];
    return [hebrewCalendar dateFromComponents:c];
}
</code></pre>

<p>Retrieve an <code>NSDateComponents</code> representing whatever is selected at the moment, turn it into an <code>NSDate</code>, and return that.</p>

<pre><code>- (void)setDate:(NSDate *)date animated:(BOOL)animated {
    NSInteger units = NSYearCalendarUnit | NSMonthCalendarUnit | NSDayCalendarUnit;
    NSDateComponents *components = [hebrewCalendar components:units fromDate:date];

    {
        NSInteger yearRow = [components year] - 1;
        [self selectRow:yearRow inComponent:YEAR_COMPONENT animated:animated];
    }

    {
        NSInteger middle = floor([self pickerView:self numberOfRowsInComponent:MONTH_COMPONENT] / 2);
        NSInteger startOfPhase = middle - (middle % maxMonthRange.length) - maxMonthRange.location;
        NSInteger monthRow = startOfPhase + [components month];

        NSInteger middle = floor([self pickerView:self numberOfRowsInComponent:DAY_COMPONENT] / 2);
        NSInteger startOfPhase = middle - (middle % maxDayRange.length) - maxDayRange.location;
        NSInteger dayRow = startOfPhase + [components day];
        [self selectRow:dayRow inComponent:DAY_COMPONENT animated:animated];
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And this is where fun stuff starts happening.</p>

<p>First, we'll take the date we were given and ask the hebrew calendar to break it up into a date components object.  If I give it an <code>NSDate</code> that corresponds to the gregorian date of 4 Apr 2012, then the hebrew calendar is going to give me an <code>NSDateComponents</code> object that corresponds to 12 Nisan 5772, which is the same day as 4 Apr 2012.</p>

<p>Based on this information, I figure out which row to select in each unit, and select it.  The year case is simple.  I simply subtract one (rows are zero-based, but years are 1-based).</p>

<p>For months, I pick the middle of the rows column, figure out where that sequence starts, and add the month number to it.  The same with the days.</p>

<p>The implementations of the base <code>&lt;UIPickerViewDataSource&gt;</code> methods are fairly trivial.  We're displaying 3 components, and each one has 10,000 rows.</p>

<pre><code>- (NSInteger)numberOfComponentsInPickerView:(UIPickerView *)pickerView {
    return 3;
}

- (NSInteger)pickerView:(UIPickerView *)pickerView numberOfRowsInComponent:(NSInteger)component {
    return LARGE_NUMBER_OF_ROWS;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Getting what's selected at the current moment is fairly simple.  I get the selected row in each component and either add 1 (in the case of <code>NSYearCalendarUnit</code>), or do a little mod operation to account for the repeating nature of the other calendar units.</p>

<pre><code>- (NSDateComponents *)selectedDateComponents {
    NSDateComponents *c = [[NSDateComponents alloc] init];

    [c setYear:[self selectedRowInComponent:YEAR_COMPONENT] + 1];

    NSInteger monthRow = [self selectedRowInComponent:MONTH_COMPONENT];
    [c setMonth:(monthRow % maxMonthRange.length) + maxMonthRange.location];

    NSInteger dayRow = [self selectedRowInComponent:DAY_COMPONENT];
    [c setDay:(dayRow % maxDayRange.length) + maxDayRange.location];

    return [c autorelease];
}
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, I need some strings to show in the UI:</p>

<pre><code>- (NSString *)pickerView:(UIPickerView *)pickerView titleForRow:(NSInteger)row forComponent:(NSInteger)component {
    NSString *format = nil;
    NSDateComponents *c = [[NSDateComponents alloc] init];

    if (component == YEAR_COMPONENT) {
        format = @""y"";
        [c setYear:row+1];
        [c setMonth:1];
        [c setDay:1];        
    } else if (component == MONTH_COMPONENT) {
        format = @""MMMM"";
        [c setYear:5774];
        [c setMonth:(row % maxMonthRange.length) + maxMonthRange.location];
        [c setDay:1];
    } else if (component == DAY_COMPONENT) {
        format = @""d"";
        [c setYear:5774];
        [c setMonth:1];
        [c setDay:(row % maxDayRange.length) + maxDayRange.location];
    }

    NSDate *d = [hebrewCalendar dateFromComponents:c];
    [c release];

    [formatter setDateFormat:format];

    NSString *title = [formatter stringFromDate:d];

    return title;
}

@end
</code></pre>

<p>This is where things are a little bit more complicated.  Unfortunately for us, <code>NSDateFormatter</code> can only format things when given an actual <code>NSDate</code>.  I can't just say ""here's a 6"" and hope to get back ""Adar I"".  Thus, I have to construct an artificial date that has the value I want in the unit I care about.</p>

<p>In the case of years, that's pretty simple.  Just create a date components for that year on Tishri 1, and I'm good.</p>

<p>For months, I have to make sure that the year is a leap year.  By doing so, I can guarantee that the month names will always be ""Adar I"" and ""Adar II"", regardless of whether the current year happens to be a leap year or not.</p>

<p>For days, I picked an arbitrary year, because every Tishri has 30 days (and no month in the Hebrew calendar has more than 30 days).</p>

<p>Once we've built the appropriate date components object, we can quickly turn it into an <code>NSDate</code> with our <code>hebrewCalendar</code> ivar, set the format string on the date formatter to only be producing strings for the unit we care about, and generate a string.</p>

<p>Assuming you've done all this correctly, you'll end up with this:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/v3ywW.png"" alt=""custom hebrew date picker""></p>

<hr>

<p>Some notes:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I've left out the implementation of <code>-pickerView:didSelectRow:inComponent:</code>.  It's up to you to figure out how you want to notify that the selected date changed.</p></li>
<li><p>This doesn't handle graying out invalid dates.  For example, you might want to consider graying out ""Adar I"" if the currently selected year isn't a leap year.  This would require using <code>-pickerView:viewForRow:inComponent:reusingView:</code> instead of the <code>titleForRow:</code> method.</p></li>
<li><p><code>UIDatePicker</code> will highlight the current date in blue.  Again, you'd have to return a custom view instead of a string to do that.</p></li>
<li><p>Your date picker will have a blackish bezel, because it is a <code>UIPickerView</code>.  Only <code>UIDatePickers</code> get the blueish one.</p></li>
<li><p>The components of the picker view will span its entire width.  If you want things to fit more naturally, you'll have to override <code>-pickerView:widthForComponent:</code> to return a sane value for the appropriate component.  This could involve hard coding a value or generating all the strings, sizing them each, and picking the largest one (plus some padding).</p></li>
<li><p>As noted previously, this always displays things in Month-Day-Year order.  Making this dynamic to the current locale would be a little bit trickier.  You'd have to get a <code>@""d MMMM y""</code> string localized to the current locale (hint: look at the class methods on <code>NSDateFormatter</code> for that), and then parse it to figure out what the order is.</p></li>
</ul>

"<p>Okay here is what I'm trying to do:</p>

<p>I have a model object that is populated by some network data, I want to be able to create it like this:</p>

<pre><code>// createWithID will fire off a request to a server 
MyObject *newObject = [MyObject createWithID:123];
if(newObject){
   //do something!

}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem I'm having is the network call within the createWithID method is asynchronous, so the method will always return before the call is complete.</p>

<p>First, is this an okay way to do this?  I like the idea of encapsulating the network call in the method.  Second, can it be done without blocking the main thread?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","115730","","<p>To expand on @danh's answer a bit, I'd say that you shouldn't have a pointer to the object until after it's all done.  For example:</p>

<pre><code>[MyObject makeObjectWithID:123 completion:^(MyObject *object, NSError *error) {
  if (object == nil) {
    NSLog(@""error creating object: %@"", error);
  } else {
    NSLog(@""created object: %@"", object);
  }
}];
</code></pre>

<p>And then the creation method would be something like this:</p>

<pre><code>+ (void)makeObjectWithID:(NSInteger)objectID completion:(void(^)(MyObject*,NSError*))handler {
  handler = Block_copy(handler);
  dispatch_async(dispatch_get_global_queue(0,0), ^{
    MyObject *object = [[MyObject alloc] initWithID:objectID];

    NSError *error = nil;
    BOOL succeeded = [object doTheExpensiveAndBlockingSetupThingWithError:&amp;error];

    if (succeeded == NO) {
      [object release], object = nil;
    }

    dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{
      handler([object autorelease], error);
    });
  });
  Block_release(handler);
}
</code></pre>

<p>In principle, I find that the safer you make the API, the less likely you'll be to screw something up.  This way is safe because you never have a pointer to a partially constructed <code>MyObject</code>.  There's no way you could get one and have it <em>not</em> be fully ready to use.  Granted there's no cancellation mechanism, but you could still extend this to allow for that.</p>

<p>You return the value of the <code>kati</code> variable, which is a pointer to the <code>_currentSession</code> object.</p>

<p>This is clearly not what you want.  You want to create a new <code>GKSession</code> with the same underlying information as <code>_currentSession</code>, right?  In that case, I would start with:</p>

<pre><code>- (id)copyWithZone:(NSZone *)zone {
  NSString *sessionID = [_currentSession sessionID];
  NSString *name = [_currentSession displayName];
  GKSessionMode sessionMode = [_currentSession sessionMode];
  GKSession *kati = [[GKSession alloc] initWithSessionID:sessionID displayName:name sessionMode:mode]; 
  return kati;

","115730","","<p>Well, since you're using the simplest API possible, there's no way to by notified if there's an error.  This is clearly explained in the first section of the <a href=""https://github.com/davedelong/DDMathParser/wiki/Usage"" rel=""nofollow"">Usage</a> page on the wiki:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are several ways to evaluate strings, depending on how much
  customization you want to do. Most of these options require an NSError
  ** parameter, although some do not.</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>If you use one of the options that does not accept an NSError **, then
  any tokenization, parsing, or evaluation errors will be NSLogged. </li>
  <li>If you use one of the options that does accept an NSError **, then you
  must supply one. Failing to do so will probably result in a crash.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>So what you want to do is this:</p>

<pre><code>NSDictionary *variableSubstitutions = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObject: [NSNumber numberWithDouble:x] forKey:@""x""];
NSError *error = nil;
NSNumber *number = [[DDMathEvaluator sharedMathEvaluator] evaluateString:plotterExpression withSubstitutions:variableSubstitutions error:&amp;error]];

if (number == nil) {
  NSLog(@""an error occurred while parsing: %@"", error);
} else {
  numericSolution = [number doubleValue];
  // continue on normally
}

  <p>How do I display this calendar in a Mac Application?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, what do you mean by <em>display</em>?  Do you just want to use the coptic calendar in your calculations?  If that's the case then all you need is an appropriate <code>NSCalendar</code> instance.  Since <code>NSCalendar</code> (and friends) are backed by the ICU, you can use any <a href=""http://unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-6.html#Identifiers"">identifier that ICU supports</a> (under ""Key/Type Definitions"").  This means you can choose from among:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>gregorian</code> - (default)</li>
<li><code>islamic</code> - Astronomical Arabic</li>
<li><code>chinese</code> - Traditional Chinese calendar</li>
<li><code>islamic-civil</code> - Civil (algorithmic) Arabic calendar</li>
<li><code>hebrew</code> - Traditional Hebrew Calendar</li>
<li><code>japanese</code> - Imperial Calendar (same as Gregorian except for the year, with one era for each Emperor)</li>
<li><code>buddhist</code> - Thai Buddhist Calendar (same as Gregorian except for the year)</li>
<li><code>persian</code> - Persian Calendar</li>
<li><code>coptic</code> - Coptic Calendar</li>
<li><code>ethiopic</code> - Ethiopic Calendar</li>
</ul>

<p>So to get the <code>NSCalendar</code> instance, it'd be a matter of:</p>

<pre><code>NSCalendar *coptic = [[NSCalendar alloc] initWithCalendarIdentifier:@""coptic""];
</code></pre>

<p>However, if you actually want to draw some UI (&agrave; la iCal), then you need a lot more information.  Fortunately, you can get that from the <code>NSCalendar</code> as well.</p>

<p>For example, you'll need to know how many months the calendar has:</p>

<pre><code>NSRange minMonthRange = [coptic minimumRangeOfUnit:NSMonthCalendarUnit]; // {1,13}
NSRange maxMonthRange = [coptic maximumRangeOfUnit:NSMonthCalendarUnit]; // {1,13}
</code></pre>

<p>So it looks like every year has 13 months.  OK, how about days in a month?</p>

<pre><code>NSRange minDayRange = [coptic minimumRangeOfUnit:NSDayCalendarUnit]; // {1,5}
NSRange maxDayRange = [coptic maximumRangeOfUnit:NSDayCalendarUnit]; // {1,30}
</code></pre>

<p>Whoa!  It looks like you can have a month that only has 5 days in it! (But no month has more than 30 days)  Let's see if we can find out some more:</p>

<pre><code>NSDateComponents *firstDayOfMonth = [[NSDateComponents alloc] init];
[firstDayOfMonth setDay:1];
for (NSInteger y = 1500; y &lt; 1520; ++y) {
    [firstDayOfMonth setYear:y];
    for (NSInteger m = 1; m &lt;= 13; ++m) {
        [firstDayOfMonth setMonth:m];

        NSDate *date = [coptic dateFromComponents:firstDayOfMonth];

        NSRange rangeOfDaysInMonth = [coptic rangeOfUnit:NSDayCalendarUnit inUnit:NSMonthCalendarUnit forDate:date];
        NSLog(@""%d - %d =&gt; %@"", y, m, NSStringFromRange(rangeOfDaysInMonth));
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This iterates through 20 years, and builds an <code>NSDate</code> that corresponds to the first day of each month in each year.  It then looks to see how many days are in that month, and logs the result.  (Note that <code>1500</code> and <code>1520</code> are arbitrary years that I picked)</p>

<p>This logs:</p>

<p>Analyzing this, we see that every month has 30 days, except for the 13th month, which (usually) has 5 days.  It appears that once every 4 years, the 13th month has 6 days.  That must be how it handles the leap day.  This sure is a nice calendar!  Everything's nice and regular.</p>

<p>Let's poke around some more:</p>

<pre><code>NSRange minHourRange = [coptic minimumRangeOfUnit:NSHourCalendarUnit]; // {0,24}
NSRange maxHourRange = [coptic maximumRangeOfUnit:NSHourCalendarUnit]; // {0,24}
</code></pre>

<p>So every day has 24 hours (daylight savings time jumps are not reflected in this range.  The Gregorian calendar also reports a minimum hour range of <code>{0,24}</code> and a maximum hour range of <code>{0,24}</code>, despite some days having 23 hours or 25 hours, depending on the DST transition).</p>

<p>Things are also normal at the minute and second level (60 each).</p>

<p>So if you're wanting to display the calendar yourself, you'll need a UI that can handle 13 months in a year, one of which is less than a week long.  At the sub-day level, things are what we're used to.</p>

postViewController.site = site;
[self.navigationController pushViewController:postViewController animated:YES];

<p>SAPostTableViewController has a static tableView which, and it's cells, are loaded from a nib.</p>

<p>I have overridden the <code>initWithNibName:bundle:</code> method:</p>

<pre><code>-(id)initWithNibName:(NSString *)nibNameOrNil bundle:(NSBundle *)nibBundleOrNil {
    if (self = [super initWithNibName:nibNameOrNil bundle:nibBundleOrNil]) {

{
    [super viewDidLoad];
     [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self selector:@selector(cellVisibiltyChanged:) name:@""SAStaticCellVisibiltyChanged"" object:nil];
}

<p>and so to match in <code>viewDidUnload</code>:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)viewDidUnload
{
    [super viewDidUnload];
    [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] removeObserver:self name:@""SAStaticCellVisibiltyChanged"" object:nil];
}
</code></pre>

<p>However when I press the back button in the navigation bar (all standard behaviour, no override) and <code>SAPostTableViewController</code> is popped, it doesn't call <code>viewDidUnload</code> or <code>dealloc</code>. So this means that if I then reselect the cell that pushes <code>SAPostTableViewController</code> it creates a new instance of <code>SAPostTableViewController</code> and repeating this back and forward just means the memory usage keeps increasing as the popped <code>SAPostTableViewController</code>s never get deallocated.

postViewController.site = site;
[self.navigationController pushViewController:postViewController animated:YES];

[postViewController release];

<p>The SAPostTableViewController is only used in this place, it is not a delegate of anything, nor does it have a delegate. </p>

<p>How can I find a fix, or is it something simple I've missed?</p>

<p>Here is what Instruments shows after pushing SAPostTableViewController just once (with only one release statement):

","115730","","<p>I don't know what your problem is, but here are some things to consider:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You should absolutely <strong>NOT</strong> release the view controller twice.  If you have indeed discovered a memory leak in UIKit (which is unlikely), then it is likely it would be fixed in a future version of UIKit.  That means that anyone running an old version of your app on a new version of the operating system would experience nothing but crashes (due to over-releasing the view controller).  It is better to leak than to crash.  A leaky app is still a usable app (at least until you leak too much).  But a crashing app can't be run at all.</p></li>
<li><p><code>-viewDidUnload</code> is not doing what you think it should be doing.  It is only called when the view controller's view is unloaded <em>due to memory pressure</em>.  It is not called during normal deallocation.  It would be wiser to rely on <code>-viewWillAppear:</code> and <code>-viewDidDisappear:</code> instead.</p></li>

<p>I tried implementing what Dave DeLong said and I did everything the exact way he showed in his example, but when I run the program, my progress bar becomes a stretched image if I try changing the value of the progress. The track image however resizes perfectly and repeats along the track. For some reason, the progress isn't doing this along the progress bar. </p>

<pre><code>UIImage * load = [[UIImage imagedNamed:@""load.png""] resizableImageWithCapInsets:UIEdgeInsetsMake(0, 1, 0, 1)];

[progressbar trackImage:track];
[progressbar setProgress:0.5];

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/EsSKQ.png"" alt=""Original images and progress bar results""></p>

<p>I tried switching my image variables from the progress image to the track image to see if maybe it was the image that wasn't resizable (which it shouldn't have been because they were the exact same image, just different colors). Except when I did this, the track image again resized perfectly and the progress image was the one that stretched. Does anyone know why this may be happening?</p>
","115730","","<p>Your resizable cap insets probably shouldn't be <code>{0,1,0,1}</code>.  In your case, it looks like they should be <code>{0,0,0,0}</code>, or <code>UIEdgeInsetsZero</code>.</p>

<p>The thing to understand about Objective-C is that <em>objects</em> do not go out of scope, since objects can only be allocated on the heap (&lt;insert normal caveat here about non-copied blocks&gt;).  Pointers to those objects (i.e., variables) can go in and out of scope, but the objects themselves are always in scope, because the heap technically counts as being global in scope.

","115730","","<blockquote>
  <p>Why is this not done with NSError * objects?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because there's no such thing as an <code>NSMutableError</code>.  Your example works because you can modify the contents of the array without modifying the pointer to the array itself.  However, since <code>NSError</code> instances are immutable, you cannot modify an <code>NSError</code>.  As such, you must necessarily create a new error object.  And if you want to return that error object along with some other piece of data, at least one of those must be done via an out-parameter (such as an <code>NSError **</code>).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are pointers passed to methods are defined as const by default?</p>

<p>Nope.  Inside that method you're welcome to do this:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)addObject:(id)someObject toArray:(NSMutableArray *)array {
  someObject = somethingElse;
  [array addObject:someObject];
}
</code></pre>

<p>What's important to remember here is that you're only changing a pointer in a slot in memory.  The memory slot corresponding to <code>someObject</code> is just a space on the stack, and you're changing the contents of that space to have a value that points to a different allocated object than the one you were given.</p>

","115730","","<p>You don't want it to show <code>$0.00</code>.  What if I'm in the UK?  Wouldn't I then want it to show <code>£0.00</code>?</p>

<p>It looks like you're incorrectly using the <code>NSNumberFormatter</code>.  Here's how you format a number for currency:</p>

<pre><code>NSNumberFormatter *f = [[NSNumberFormatter alloc] init];
[f setNumberStyle:NSNumberFormatterCurrencyStyle];
NSString *string = [f stringFromNumber:[NSNumber numberWithFloat:1234.56]];
[f release];

<p>That will format things correctly, regardless of your locale.  It'll use the correct currency sign, the correct thousands separator, and the correct decimal separator.  Attempting to recreate this functionality yourself is a Bad Idea™.</p>

On the other hand, it seems to imply that the only thing that is still using my CPU is the Objective-C overhead for messages (<code>objc_msgSend</code>). Hence, that if I had written the application in, say, Carbon, its performance would be drastically better.</p>

<p>Now I am tempted to conclude that Objective-C is a language with bad performance, even though Cocoa seems to be awfully efficient since it can apparently draw faster than Objective-C can send messages.</p>

I'm trying to get a sense of applications that are out there and what will happen with a poorly memory-managed program.</p>

I imagine what I'm doing is creating an overhead of the memory needed to store that string, so it's probably quite piddling (a few bytes?)

"<p><em>SO is telling me this question is subjective and likely to be closed. It is indeed subjective, because I'm asking for the opinion of experienced Objective-C developers. Should I post this somewhere else? Please advise.</em></p>

<hr>

<p>Fairly new to Objective-C, though fairly confident in the concept of writing OOP code, I've been struggling with the NSNotification vs Delegate dilemma from the start. I've posted a few questions about that subject alone. I do get the gist, I think. Notifications are broadcasted globally, so shouldn't be used for notifying closely related objects. Delegates exist to hand over tasks to other object, that act on behalf of the delegated object. While this can be used for closely related objects, I find the workflow to be verbose (new class, new protocol, etc), and the word ""delegation"" alone makes me think of armies and bosses and in general makes me feel uneasy.</p>

<p>Where I come from (AS3) there are things called Events. They're halfway between delegates and NSNotifications and pretty much ruled the world of flash notifying, until fairly recently, a Mr. Robert Penner came along and expressed his dissatisfaction with events. He therefore wrote a library that is now widely used in the AS3 community, called Signals. Inspired by C# events and Signals/Slots in Qt, these signals are actually properties of objects, that you access from the outside and add listeners to. There's much more you can do with a signal, but at it's core, that's it.</p>

<p>Because the concept is so humble, I gave it a go and wrote my own signal class in Objective-C. <a href=""https://gist.github.com/793751"" rel=""nofollow"">I've gisted Signal.h/.m here</a>.</p>

<p>A way to use this for notifying class A of an event in class B could look like this:</p>

<pre><code>// In class b, assign a Signal instance to a retained property:
self.awesomeThingHappened = [[[Signal alloc] init] autorelease];

// In class a, owner of class b, listen to the signal:
[b.awesomeThingHappened add:self withSelector:@selector(reactToAwesomeThing)];

// And when something actually happens, you dispatch the signal in class b:
[self.awesomeThingHappened dispatch];

// You might even pass along a userInfo dictionary, your selector should match:
[self.awesomeThingHappened dispatchWithUserInfo:userInfo];
</code></pre>

<p>I hope it adheres to the right memory management rules, but when the signal deallocs, it should automatically remove all listeners and pass away silently. A signal like this isn't supposed to be a generic replacement of notification and delegation, but there are lot's of close counter situations where I feel a Signal is cleaner than the other two.</p>

<p>My question for stackoverflow is what do you think of a solution like this? Would you instantly erase this from your project if one of your interns puts it in? Would you fire your employee if he already finished his internship? Or is there maybe already something similar yet much grander out there that you'd use instead?</p>

<p>Thanks for your time, EP.</p>

<p><em>EDIT: Let me give a concrete example of how I used this in an iOS project.</em></p>

<p>Consider this scenario of four object types with nested ownership. There's a view controller owning a window manager, owning several windows, each owning a view with controls, among which a close button. There's probably a design flaw in here, but that's not the point of the example :P</p>

<p>Now when the close button is tapped, a gesture recognizer fires the first selector in the window object. This needs to notify the window manager that it's closing. The window manager may then decide whether another window appears, or whether the windows stay hidden alltogether, at which point the view controller needs to get a bump to enable scrolling on the main view.</p>

<p>The notifications from window to window manager, and from window manager to view controller are the ones I've now implemented with Signals. This might have been a case of delegation, but for just a 'close' action, it seemed so verbose to create two delegate protocols. On the other hand, because the coupling of these objects is very well defined, it also didn't seem like a case for NSNotifications. There's also not really a value change that I could observe with KVO, because it's just a button tap. Listening to some kind of 'hidden' state would only make me have to reset that flag when reopening a window, which makes it harder to understand and a little error prone.</p>
","115730","","<blockquote>
  <p>What do you think of a solution like this?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't really see what the benefit is. To me, it seems like a combination of target/action+notifications (you can have multiple target/actions for a single notification event, but the t/a pair is registered with the object itself as opposed to a global notification center).  In fact, it's more like key-value-observing that way, except that KVO is limited to observable properties.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Would you instantly erase this from your project if one of your interns puts it in?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No.  It's not <em>bad</em> code.  In fact, it seems kinda neat.  But I just don't see an obvious benefit to it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Would you fire your employee if he already finished his internship? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course not.  You don't fire people for writing good code.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is there maybe already something similar yet much grander out there that you'd use instead?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you really wanted to make this neat, change the API to use blocks instead.  Then you could do:</p>

<pre><code>[object dispatchOnAwesomeThingHappened:^{
  NSLog(@""holy cow, something awesome just happened!"");
}];
</code></pre>

<p>Again, however, you'd be limited to reacting to stuff that the objects explicitly ""dispatch"".  It would be much neater if you could attach stuff to immediately before and/or after any arbitrary method call.

"<p>I'm new to Objective-C and I have gone through many topics, What are the key concepts on which I should put more emphasis for developing iPhone Apps?</p>
","115730","","<p>These aren't necessarily specific to iPhone development, but without them, you will not ever get it.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Pointers</strong> - know what a pointer is. Know why we need the dynamically allocated memory versus statically allocated memory. (I know this may sound trivial, but in my experience, this is the #1 thing that newcomers have the most trouble with)  This is because you'll never* deal with raw objects in Objective-C.  You always deal with object <em>references</em>.  (ie, you never deal with an <code>NSString</code>, but always an <code>NSString *</code>)  However, there are things that <em>look</em> like objects, but aren't actually.  <code>NSRect</code>s are structs and they can be stack-allocated.  <code>NSInteger</code> is simply a <code>typedef</code> for a primitive <code>int</code>.  If you don't know what a pointer is, you'll go crazy wondering when you're supposed to put in a <code>*</code> and when you're not.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Memory Management</strong> - the iPhone does not have garbage collection.  You must manually manage your memory.  Accept that and move on.  <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/MemoryMgmt/MemoryMgmt.html"" rel=""nofollow"">The rules for memory management conventions</a> in Objective-C are <em>trivial</em>.  Memorize them, and always remember to use them.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><sub>* the only time you'll deal with stack-allocated objects are blocks (<code>^{ ... }</code>) or when you're doing something fiendishly devious.</sub></p>

"<p>On the tech talk 2011 I saw a speech about the new <code>UIAppearance</code> <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/uikit/reference/UIAppearance_Protocol/Reference/Reference.html"">protocol</a>.  There is not a lot of documentation out there yet. I will shortly summarize what I remember to explain where my question is coming from:</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>About <code>UIAppearance</code>:</strong></p>

<p>So far you had to customize EVERY navigation bar (toolbar, etc.) property in all your app view controllers. With the new appearance property you can do it in only one place for all navigation bars in your app. For instance: if you want to customize your Navigation bar background image you could do it like this:</p>

<pre><code>[[UINavigationBar appearance] setBackgroundImage:
   [UIImage imageNamed:@""MyImageName""] forBarMetrics:UIBarMetricsDefault]; 
</code></pre>

<p>This will set the background image of ALL navigation bars within your application. With the <code>barMetrics</code> you specify whether you want the image to be used also in landscape mode or not.</p>

<p>If you want to specify the appearance to be applied only in some view controllers there is also a method in the docs to control that by specifying where your objects are located:</p>

<pre><code>[[UIBarButtonItem appearanceWhenContainedIn:
    [ABPeoplePickerNavigationController class], nil] setTintColor:myNavBarColor];
</code></pre>

<p>Also worth to mention is, if you have single customized instances, differing from your appearance settings, theses instances will not be effected by the appearance proxy.  </p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Some questions:</strong></p>

<p><strong>a) How do I know which properties of a class work with the appearance property?</strong> For e.g. since <code>UITableView</code> conforms to the UIAppearance protocol I was thinking I could do something like</p>

<pre><code>[[UITableView appearance] setBackgroundColor:mytableViewColor];
</code></pre>

<p>to manipulate the background color of all my table views, but I can't!  </p>

<p><strong>b) Is there a list of all classes that are manipulatable with the appearance property?</strong> </p>

<p><strong>c) At what point is the appearance customization being called?</strong> I was hoping to make changes threw the appearance property at runtime, but unfortunately the changes aren't taking place.  </p>
","115730","","<blockquote>
  <p>a) How do I know which instances of a class work with the appearance property? For e.g. since UITableView conforms to the UIAppearance protocol I was thinking I could do something like</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You look in the header of the class (and the headers of all the superclasses).  Any method that has <code>UI_APPEARANCE_SELECTOR</code> next to it is supported for use with the <code>UIAppearance</code> proxy.</p>

<pre><code>[[UITableView appearance] setBackgroundColor:mytableViewColor];
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>backgroundColor</code> property is not decorated with <code>UI_APPEARANCE_SELECTOR</code> in <code>UIView.h</code>.  Thus it is not technically supported for use with the appearance proxy.  It will <em>probably</em> work, but (given the lack of method decoration) isn't guaranteed to.</p>

<p>From the <code>UIAppearance Protocol Reference</code>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To support appearance customization, a class must conform to the <code>UIAppearanceContainer</code> protocol and relevant accessor methods must be marked with <code>UI_APPEARANCE_SELECTOR</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(note ""<strong>and</strong> relevant accessor methods <strong>must</strong> be marked..."" [emphasis added])</p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p>b) Is there a list of all properties that are manipulatable with the appearance property?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is there a single page showing every setter that works with the appearance proxy? I don't know of one, nor is there a way to build the list at runtime.</p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p>c) At what point is the appearance customization being called? I was hoping to make changes threw the appearance property at runtime, but unfortunately the changes aren't taking place.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can use the appearance proxy at any point during execution.  The changes won't be applied to the affected views until the next time those views have their <code>-layoutSubviews</code> method invoked.</p>

","115730","","<p>Here's an alternative that doesn't require reversing the path at all.</p>

<p>You have a portion of a view you essentially want to ""clip out"":</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ea76X.png"" alt=""clipped out""></p>

<p>Let's say you want the white area to be <code>[UIColor whiteColor]</code> with 75% alpha.  Here's how you do it quickly:</p>

<ul>
<li>You create a new <code>UIView</code> subclass.</li>
<li><p>This view has two properties:</p>

<pre><code>@property (retain) UIColor *fillColor;
@property (retain) UIBezierPath *punchedOutPath;
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>You override its <code>-drawRect:</code> method to do this:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)drawRect:(CGRect)rect {
  [[self fillColor] set];
  UIRectFill(rect);

  CGContextRef ctx = UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext();
  CGContextSetBlendMode(ctx, kCGBlendModeDestinationOut);

  [[self punchedOutPath] fill];

  CGContextSetBlendMode(ctx, kCGBlendModeNormal);
}
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>There's a caveat here:  The <code>fillColor</code> of the view must <em>not</em> include the alpha component.  So in your case, you'd want that to just be <code>[UIColor whiteColor]</code>.  You then apply the alpha bit yourself by calling <code>[myView setAlpha:0.75]</code>.</p>

<p>What's going on here:  This is using a blend mode called ""Destination Out"".  Mathematically it's defined as <code>R = D*(1 - Sa)</code>, but in layman's terms it means ""Destination image wherever destination image is opaque but source image is transparent, and transparent elsewhere.""</p>

<p>So it's going to use the destination (i.e., what's already in the context) wherever the <em>new</em> stuff is transparent (i.e. outside of the bezier path), and then where the bezier path would be opaque, that stuff is going to become transparent.  However, the destination stuff must already be <em>opaque</em>.  If it's not opaque, the blending doesn't do what you want.  This is why you have to provide an opaque <code>UIColor</code> and then do any transparency you want with the view directly.</p>

<hr>

<p>I ran this myself, with these circumstances:</p>

<ul>
<li>the window has a <code>[UIColor greenColor]</code> background</li>
<li>the <code>fillColor</code> is white</li>
<li>the <code>punchedOutPath</code> is a oval that's inset 10 points from the edges of the view.</li>
<li>the view has an <code>alpha</code> of <code>0.75</code></li>
</ul>

<p>With the code above, I get this:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/ONq0K.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The interior is pure green, and the outside has the semi-transparent overlay.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>If your covering is an <em>image</em>, then you'll need to create a new image.  But the principle is the same:</p>

<pre><code>UIImage* ImageByPunchingPathOutOfImage(UIImage *image, UIBezierPath *path) {
  UIGraphicsBeginImageContextWithOptions([image size], YES, [image scale]);

  [image drawAtPoint:CGPointZero];

  CGContextRef ctx = UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext();
  CGContextSetBlendMode(ctx, kCGBlendModeDestinationOut);
  [path fill];


  UIImage *final = UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext();
  UIGraphicsEndImageContext();
  return final;
}
</code></pre>

<p>You would then take the result of this function and put it into a <code>UIImageView</code>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Correct.  It is an <code>NSPredicateEditor</code>, not an <code>NSPredicatesEditor</code>.  ;)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When I use ""predicateForRow:"" it returns <code>(null)</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm not sure I would use that method.  My general rule of thumb is to largely ignore that <code>NSPredicateEditor</code> is a subclass of <code>NSRuleEditor</code>, mainly because it's such a highly specialized subclass that many of the superclass methods don't make that much sense on a predicate editor (like all the stuff about criteria, row selection, etc).  It's possible that they're somehow relevant, but if they are, I haven't figured out <em>how</em> yet.</p>

<p>To get the predicate from the editor, you do:</p>

<pre><code>NSPredicate *predicate = [myPredicateEditor objectValue];

<p>You mean <code>(name = [something]) AND (size = [something] OR date = [something])</code>?</p>

<p>Yes, but that is a <em>BAD</em> idea.  It's bad because <code>NSPredicate</code> already contains all the information you need, and converting it to a different format and doing <em>string</em> manipulations just isn't necessary and can potentially lead to complications (like if someone can type in a value for ""name"", what happens if they type in "" OR ""?).</p>

<p>I'm having a hard time trying to figure out what it is you're trying to do.  It sounds like you have an array of <code>NSString</code> objects that you want to filter based on a predicate that the user creates?

","115730","","<p>There is no such thing as a date without a time, because there never was a point in time that did not have a time (according to our current calendaring systems, anyway), and a date is just a point in time.  Ergo, a date necessarily <em>must</em> have a time.  </p>

1: load the app, and click on either of the two entries.
2: Go back to the tableView controller
3: tap BELOW both of the entries, in the white space where there shouldn't be a cell
The app will crash, but notice that the indexPath doesn't say its trying to select a cell that is outside the bounds of the tableView, just that the tableView didSelectRowAtIndexPath method doesn't exist</p>
","115730","","<p>The call to <code>super</code> in <code>tableView:didSelectRowAtIndexPath:</code> is unnecessary.  If I remember correctly, <code>UITableViewController</code> does not provide a default implementation of that method.  Thus, your call to super results in a crash.</p>

"<p>I am writing a simple application that has 3 view controllers. The root view controller is an <code>item listing</code>, basic table view. Off of this view controller, I push two different view controllers based on some user interaction - a <code>create item</code> view controller or a <code>view item</code> view controller.</p>

<p>So, the storyboard segues just look like a V, or something.</p>

<p>On my <code>create item</code> view controller, I would like it to pop back to the root view controller when the user creates a new item, but then push to the <code>view item</code> controller so that I can look at the newly created item.</p>

<p>I can't seem to get this to work. It's easy enough to pop back to the root view controller, but I'm unable to push that <code>view item</code> controller.</p>

","115730","","<p>The answer is simple: the parser used by <code>NSPredicate</code> assumes that anything inside the quote marks is a string literal, and does not attempt to do any substitutions on its contents.

<p>How would I return all the ingredients related to recipes, specifically from recipes that belong to events? And then order them by aisle?</p>

<p>Further explanation:</p>

<p>User has a ""recipe book"" of Recipe objects, which has a relationship to Ingredients. The user will associate a Recipe to an Event when they plan on preparing the Recipe. The data I'm trying to pull out is the list of Ingredients that belong to Recipes, that belong to Events, ordered by Aisle. Basically a ""grocery list"".</p>

<p>Further explanation on what an Event object is:
Events allow for duplicate recipes. Say I am going to have a fried egg (ingredient = ""1 fresh egg"") for 3 consecutive days (3 separate events), I want the shopping list to contain ""1 fresh egg"" three times - one instance for each event.</p>

<p>Here is my fetch request, which is not returning any results - I assume the crux of the issue is the predicate:</p>

<pre><code>NSFetchRequest *request = [[NSFetchRequest alloc] init];

NSEntityDescription *entity = [NSEntityDescription entityForName:@""Ingredient""    inManagedObjectContext:[self managedObjectContext]];
[request setEntity:entity];

// get ingredients of recipes that belong to events
[request setPredicate:[NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@""Ingredient.recipe == Event.recipe""]];

// sort by ""aisle""
NSSortDescriptor *sortDescriptorCategory = [NSSortDescriptor sortDescriptorWithKey:@""aisle"" ascending:YES];
request.sortDescriptors = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:sortDescriptorCategory, nil];

// create nsfrc with ""aisle"" as sectionNameKeyPath
NSFetchedResultsController *frc = [[NSFetchedResultsController alloc] initWithFetchRequest:request managedObjectContext:self.managedObjectContext sectionNameKeyPath:@""aisle"" cacheName:@""MyFRCCache""];
frc.delegate = self;
NSError *error = nil;
if (![frc performFetch:&amp;error]) {
    NSLog(@""Unresolved error %@, %@"", error, [error userInfo]);
    abort();

<pre><code>NSString *format = [NSDateFormatter dateFormatFromTemplate:@""j"" options:0 locale:[NSLocale currentLocale]];
BOOL is24Hour = ([format rangeOfString:@""a""].location == NSNotFound);
</code></pre>

<h1>Explanation</h1>

<p>The string formatting character to represent the am/pm symbol is ""a"", as documented in <a href=""http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-31/tr35-dates.html#Date_Format_Patterns"">Unicode Locale Markup Language – Part 4: Dates</a>.</p>

<p>The same document also explains the special template symbol ""j"":</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is a special-purpose symbol. It must not occur in pattern or skeleton data. Instead, it is reserved for use in skeletons passed to APIs doing flexible date pattern generation. In such a context, it requests the preferred hour format for the locale (h, H, K, or k), as determined by whether h, H, K, or k is used in the standard short time format for the locale. In the implementation of such an API, 'j' must be replaced by h, H, K, or k before beginning a match against availableFormats data. Note that use of 'j' in a skeleton passed to an API is the only way to have a skeleton request a locale's preferred time cycle type (12-hour or 24-hour).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <code>NSString</code> method <code>dateFormatFromTemplate:options:locale:</code> is described in Apple's <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSDateFormatter_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/clm/NSDateFormatter/dateFormatFromTemplate%3aoptions%3alocale%3a""><code>NSDateFormatter</code> documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Returns a localized date format string representing the given date format components arranged appropriately for the specified locale.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, what that method will do is turn the <code>@""j""</code> you pass in as a template in to a format string suitable for <code>NSDateFormatter</code>. If this string contains the am / pm symbol <code>@""a""</code> in it anywhere, then you know the locale (and other user settings being interrogated by the OS for you) wants am / pm to be displayed.</p>

"<p>I am a novice objective c programmer with a good amount of experience with other OO languages.  </p>

<p>Currently I am working on a calculator that involves some unit conversion.  My initial thought was to have a two abstract classes: <em>Measurement</em> and <em>Unit</em>.  Subclasses of Unit would be things like <em>Meter</em>, <em>Kilogram</em>, <em>Second</em>, etc.  These classes would contain information about the multiplier to some base unit (probably the SI units) as well as some information useful to the UI like label and description.  Subclasses of Measurement would be things like <em>Length</em>, <em>Mass</em>, <em>Time</em>, etc.  These classes would contain the value and unit of the measurement as well as the methods necessary to determine allowed conversions and conduct the conversions.</p>

<p>I am starting to have questions like ""How do I have only one Meter class shared by any Length class that needs it?"" and ""How do I store a list of allowed units per measurement that is common to any measurement of that type?"" This is leading me to believe that I may be over-engineering my class hierarchy.  I was wondering if anyone had suggestions on different architectures to accomplish this task or perhaps language features that a novice may be unaware of that may help with my implementation.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
","115730","","<p>So, I wrote <a href=""https://github.com/davedelong/DDUnitConverter"" rel=""nofollow"">a unit conversion library in Objective-C</a> and I just used enums.  There's a lookup method in each converter class (a different class for Area, Length, etc), which has a <code>if()</code> statement that returns the multiplier for the specified unit into the base unit.  The conversion method then either divides or multiplies by that number, depending on whether you're converting from or to that unit.</p>

"<p>What I am trying to accomplish here is taking a tableView with a prototype cell, and display the dates in each cell for a year, or two years. I have gotten it to display todays date in the label by using the following code:</p>

<pre><code>NSDateFormatter *dateFormatter = [[NSDateFormatter alloc] init];
[dateFormatter setDateFormat:@""MM/dd/yyyy""];
NSDate *dateNow = [NSDate date];
dateArray = [NSMutableArray arrayWithObjects:[dateFormatter stringFromDate:dateNow], nil];
</code></pre>

<p>It works to add one date (todays date) to the first cell. I can not figure out how to get it to add all days by an interval of 1. Any help?</p>

<p>I display the information in the array with this code:</p>

<pre><code>static NSString *CellIdentifier = @""Cell"";

Custom *cell = [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier:CellIdentifier];
cell.dateLabel.text = [dateArray objectAtIndex:indexPath.row];
</code></pre>
","115730","","<p>You don't need to maintain an array of dates.  If you want to display the <em>n</em><sup>th</sup> row, you can just add <em>n</em> days to your start date and use that.</p>

<p>So you'd have your start date stored in an instance variable:</p>

<pre><code>NSDate *_startDate;
</code></pre>

<p>To determine how many rows should be in the tableView, you have to figure out how many days are in that year (I'm going to assume you're only displaying one year):</p>

<pre><code>- (NSInteger)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView numberOfRowsInSection:(NSInteger)section {
  // get the calendar
  NSCalendar *calendar = [NSCalendar currentCalendar];

  // get the date that points to the first day of the first month of the year containing the start date
  // note that we include the era, because some calendars have more than an ""AD""/""BC"" kind of era
  NSDateComponents *yearStartComponents = [calendar components:(NSEraCalendarUnit | NSYearCalendarUnit) fromDate:_startDate];
  [yearStartComponents setMonth:1];
  [yearStartComponents setDay:1];
  NSDate *startOfYear = [calendar dateFromComponents:yearStartComponents];

  NSDateComponents *yearDiff = [[NSDateComponents alloc] init];
  [yearDiff setYear:1];

  // add one year to that date
  NSDate *startOfNextYear = [calendar dateByAddingComponents:yearDiff toDate:startOfYear options:0];

  // figure out how many days were between the two dates
  NSDateComponents *dayDiff = [calendar components:NSDayCalendarUnit fromDate:startOfYear toDate:startOfNextYear options:0];

  return [dayDiff day];
}
</code></pre>

<p>And then when you need the cell, you can just use the ""row"" of the indexPath as the number of days from the start date:</p>

<pre><code>- (UITableViewCell *)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView cellForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath {
  UITableViewCell *cell = ...;

  NSCalendar *calendar = [NSCalendar currentCalendar];
  NSDateComponents *diff = [[NSDateComponents alloc] init];
  [diff setDay:[indexPath row]];
  NSDate *date = [calendar dateByAddingComponents:diff toDate:_startDate options:0];

  NSLocale *locale = [NSLocale currentLocale];
  NSString *formatted = [NSDateFormatter localizedStringFromDate:date dateStyle:NSDateFormatterShortStyle timeStyle:NSDateFormatterNoStyle locale:locale];

  [[cell textLabel] setText:formatted];

  return cell;
}
</code></pre>

<p>There are several nice things about this approach:</p>

<ol>
<li>It works regardless of the length of the year.  Whether the current year has 353, 355, 365, 366, or 384 days in the year, it'll work.</li>
<li>It works regardless of the current calendar.  There's more than just the Gregorian calendar out there.  <code>NSCalendar</code> supports the Gregorian, Buddhist, Chinese, Hebrew, Islamic, Islamic Civil, Japanese, Republic of China, Persian, Indian, and ISO8601 calendars.</li>
<li>You're not hard-coding a format string.  By using the <code>NSDateFormatterStyles</code>, you'll be using the appropriate short-hand notation for a date, whether that's ""5/12/12"" or ""5 Dec '12"" or something entirely different.</li>
</ol>

"<p>I came up with a solution to this using subquery, but I don't understand why what I was trying to do first didn't work.</p>

<p>Here's my data model. I'm fetching on Advice.</p>

<p>I can do the following as a predicate:</p>

<pre><code>[NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@""ANY conditions.terrain == %@"", aTerrainObject];

<pre><code>[NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@""ANY conditions.terrain == nil""];
</code></pre>

<p>What I want to do is return any piece of advice where at least one of its conditions doesn't have a terrain type set.</p>

<p>However, the following does work:</p>

<pre><code>[NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@""SUBQUERY(conditions, $x, $x.terrain == nil).@count &gt; 0""];
</code></pre>

<p>Can anyone explain why, when searching for nil, I can't use the <code>ANY</code> syntax?</p>
","115730","","<blockquote>
  <p>Can anyone explain why, when searching for nil, I can't use the ANY syntax?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yep!  Here's what's going on.</p>

<pre><code>[NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@""ANY conditions.terrain == nil""];
</code></pre>

<p>First, let's break this up into the appropriate left and right expressions:</p>

<pre><code>conditions.terrain
</code></pre>

<p>This will be evaluated by taking the <code>SELF</code> object (an <code>Advice</code> instance) and requesting the <code>valueForKeyPath:@""conditions.terrain""</code>.  The result of this keypath will be a collection.  You're essentially doing:</p>

<pre><code>Advice *a = ...;
NSSet *conditions = [a conditions];
NSSet *terrains = [conditions valueForKey:@""terrain""];
</code></pre>

<p>So, you have a collection of (potential) <code>Terrain</code> instances.  Now, what do we know about collections in Objective-C?  Well for one thing, they cannot contain <code>nil</code>.  They can only contain objects.  This means that when it executes the <code>ANY</code> portion of the predicate, it's going to iterate through the items in the array and see that none of them are <code>nil</code>.</p>

<p>Thus, your predicate is failing.  I tried playing around with some other variations (using <code>[NSNull null]</code> instead of <code>nil</code>, etc), but none of them seemed to work.</p>

<p>It would therefore appear that your use of a <code>SUBQUERY</code> to solve this is about as good as you could get.  I would highly recommend <a href=""https://bugreport.apple.com"">filing a bug</a> detailing your expectations and expressing why you think this should work.</p>

<p>I am trying to construct a predicate which returns only those calendar periods for which the equivalent period a year earlier exists. Example: Return the period <code>2012, 9, 3</code> (year, month, length) as result only if there is the period <code>2011, 9, 3</code> in the array. The predicate needs to compare every calendar period with each calendar period in the array.</p>

<p>This is the predicate which I tried: </p>

<pre><code>predicate = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:
       @""SUBQUERY(SELF, $x, $x.endYear == endYear - 1 ""
        ""AND $x.endMonth == endMonth AND $x.length = length).@count &gt; 0""];
</code></pre>

<p><strong>The problem:</strong></p>

<p>However, running my app with this predicate results in a runtime crash with the error message:  <strong>NSInternalInconsistencyException', reason: 'Can't perform collection evaluate with non-collection object.'</strong></p>

<p>What is wrong with my predicate and how would I need to specify it correctly?</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>
","115730","","<p>First, to address the error you're seeing.  This is your predicate:</p>

<pre><code>[NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@""SUBQUERY(SELF, $x, $x.endYear == endYear - 1 ""
    ""AND $x.endMonth == endMonth AND $x.length = length).@count &gt; 0""]
</code></pre>

<p>The first argument to a <code>SUBQUERY</code> expression is a collection which the <code>SUBQUERY</code> will iterate.  Thus, you're expecting <code>SELF</code> to evaluate to either an <code>NSArray</code> or an <code>NSSet</code>.  However, your use of the keypaths <code>endYear</code>, <code>endMonth</code>, and <code>length</code> in the subquery predicate seem to indicate that you're expecting <code>SELF</code> to evaluate to a <code>CalendarPeriod</code>.  Thus, either <code>SELF</code> is a collection (and <code>endYear</code>, <code>endMonth</code>, and <code>length</code> are invalid keypaths for the collection), or <code>SELF</code> is a <code>CalendarPeriod</code> (and therefore can't be used as the <code>SUBQUERY</code>'s collection.  Based on your error, it seems to be the latter.</p>

<p>If we were to write your problem out (without using an <code>NSPredicate</code>), we'd probably end up with something like this:</p>

<pre><code>NSArray *calendarPeriods = ...;
for (CalendarPeriod *period in calendarPeriods) {
  for (CalendarPeriod *otherPeriod in calendarPeriods) {
    if ([otherPeriod endYear] == [period endYear] - 1 &amp;&amp; [otherPeriod endMonth] == [period endMonth] &amp;&amp; [otherPeriod length] == [period length]) {
      return YES;
    }
  }
}
return NO;
</code></pre>

<p>So, how to replicate this...</p>

<p>Your initial attempt seems to be pretty good.  I think the only change that needs to be made is that instead of <code>SELF</code> as the first parameter to the <code>SUBQUERY</code>, you should use <code>%@</code>, and the substitute in the <code>calendarPeriods</code> collection there.  Alternatively, if you're executing this as the predicate to an <code>NSFetchRequest</code>, you could try using a <code>FETCH()</code> expression to fetch every <code>CalendarPeriod</code> object.</p>

<p>You're looking at pretty bad performance if you go this route, by the way.  It's a guaranteed O(N<sup>2</sup>), and you could do much better.  For example, if you fetched every <code>CalendarPeriod</code> into memory, and then inserted them into an <code>NSDictionary</code> keyed by a combination of the <code>endYear</code>, <code>endMonth</code>, and <code>length</code>, then you could cut it down to O(N) time.</p>

"<p>Is there a way to get all days in a month generically ?</p>

<p>Something like this:</p>

<p><code>[NSPredicate predicatewithFormat@""(date.firstDayOfMonth &gt;= @)AND(date.lastDayOfMonth &lt;= @)""];</code></p>
","115730","","<p>Yes.  You need to figure out what the first <em>instant</em> of the month is, as well as the first instant of the next month.  Here's how I would do it:</p>

<pre><code>NSDate *now = [NSDate date];
NSCalendar *calendar = [NSCalendar currentCalendar];
NSDateComponents *nowComponents = [calendar components:NSEraCalendarUnit | NSYearCalendarUnit | NSMonthCalendarUnit | NSDayCalendarUnit fromDate:now];
[nowComponents setDay:1];

NSDate *beginningOfCurrentMonth = [calendar dateFromComponents:nowComponents];

NSDateComponents *oneMonth = [[NSDateComponents alloc] init];
[oneMonth setMonth:1];

NSDate *beginningOfNextMonth = [calendar dateByAddingComponents:oneMonth toDate:beginningOfCurrentMonth options:0];
</code></pre>

<p>Once you've got those two <code>NSDate</code>s, then you can do:</p>

<pre><code>[NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@""date &gt;= %@ AND date &lt; %@"", beginningOfCurrentMonth, beginningOfNextMonth];
</code></pre>
"
"<p>Since there is new <code>NSNumber</code> literals in Objective-C that you can use, for instance:</p>

<pre><code>NSNumber *n1 = @1000;  // [NSNumber numberWithInt:1000]
</code></pre>

<p>But it doesn't seem to be possible to use together with enums? I have tried:</p>

<pre><code>typedef enum {

    MyEnumA = 0,
    MyEnumB,
    MyEnumC

} MyEnum;

NSNumber *n2 = @MyEnumA;  // [NSNumber numberWithInt:MyEnumA]
</code></pre>

<p>But I get a compiler error saying: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unexpected '@' in program</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't understand why it doesn't work since an enum is an int?
Is there a way to make this work?</p>
","115730","","<p>Others have explained what the proper syntax is. Here's <em>why</em>:</p>

<p><code>@blah</code> is called the ""literal"" syntax. You use it to make objects wrapping a literal, like a char, BOOL, int, etc. that means:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>@42</code> is a boxed int</li>
<li><code>@'c'</code> is a boxed char</li>
<li><code>@""foo""</code> is a boxed char*</li>
<li><code>@42ull</code> is a boxed unsigned long long</li>
<li><code>@YES</code> is a boxed BOOL</li>
</ul>

<p>All of the things following the at sign are primitive values. <code>MyEnumValue</code> is not a literal. It's a symbol. To accommodate this, generic boxing syntax was introduced:</p>

<pre><code>@(MyEnumValue)
</code></pre>

<p>You can put a bunch of things inside the parentheses; for the most part, any sort of variable or expression ought to work. </p>

"<p>I have a coreData model already setup and data added to it. I want to search for all items from the last 30 days, and then add together a total number of units.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>
","115730","","<p>Your predicate seems to be OK, but your date code is incorrect, for a couple of reasons.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>[NSDate date]</code> returns the current date, with sub-millisecond precision.  So if you create the predicate at 4:15:37 PM local time, this predicate would not find any objects with a date of 5:37:42 PM local time.  If you want down-to-the-second precision like that, then you're probably OK.  But if you want granularity to a different calendar unit (such as by day), then you need to do more work.</li>
<li><p>Not every day has 86,400 seconds in it.  Thus your attempt to subtract (30*86400) is subtly wrong.  You should be letting the calendar object do the math for you:</p>

<pre><code>NSDate *endDate = ...;
NSDateComponents *diff = [[NSDateComponents alloc] init];
[diff setDay:-30];
NSCalendar *calendar = [NSCalendar currentCalendar];
NSDate *startDate = [calendar dateByAddingComponents:diff toDate:endDate options:0];

"<p>My question is quite similar to this one: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4609609/use-singleton-in-interface-builder"">Use Singleton In Interface Builder?</a></p>

<p>The only difference is that I use ARC. So, if simplified, my singleton looks like that:</p>

<p><em>Manager.m</em></p>

<pre><code>@implementation Manager

+ (instancetype)sharedManager {
    __strong static id sharedInstance = nil;
    static dispatch_once_t onceToken;
    dispatch_once(&amp;onceToken, ^{
        sharedInstance = [[self alloc] init];
    });
    return sharedInstance;
}

@end
</code></pre>

<p>So the question is if it's possible to adopt it for Interface Builder still being with ARC?</p>

<p>Of course, I understand that it might be simpler just to rewrite that class without ARC so the question is rather academic. :)</p>
","115730","","<p>When the nib is unarchived, it'll attempt to either <code>alloc</code>/<code>init</code> or <code>alloc</code>/<code>initWithCoder:</code> a new instance of the class.</p>

<p>So, what you could do is intercept that call and re-route it to return your singleton:</p>

<pre><code>+ (id)sharedInstance {
  static Singleton *sharedInstance = nil;
  static dispatch_once_t onceToken;
  dispatch_once(&amp;onceToken, ^{
    sharedInstance = [[self actualAlloc] actualInit];
  });
  return sharedInstance;
}

+ (id)actualAlloc {
  return [super alloc];
}

+ (id)alloc {
  return [Singleton sharedInstance];
}

- (id)actualInit {
  self = [super init];
  if (self) {
    // singleton setup...
  }
  return self;
}

- (id)init {
  return self;
}

- (id)initWithCoder:(NSCoder *)decoder {
  return self;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This allows <code>-init</code> and <code>-initWithCoder:</code> to be safely called multiple times on the same object.  It's generally not recommended to allow this, but given that singletons are already cases of ""a place where things can get really wonky"", this isn't the worst you could do.</p>

","115730","","<p>Yes, you can do this.</p>

<p>You want the array of left expressions to be the actual keyPaths in the final predicate.  In your case, <code>""Field1""</code> and <code>""Field2""</code>.</p>

<p>As for making a different value appear in the popup, here's where a mind-bending concept comes in:</p>

<p><em>You're going to localize your predicate editor into English</em>.</p>

<p>There are two ways you could do this.</p>

<ol>
<li>With a .strings file</li>
<li>With an <code>NSDictionary</code></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>With a .strings file</strong></p>

<p>In your source, you would include the following in a comment:</p>

<pre><code>// NSLocalizedStringFromTable(@""%[Field1,Field2]@ %[contains]@ %@"", @""PredicateEditor"", @"""")
</code></pre>

<p>When you run <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/genstrings.1.html""><code>genstrings</code></a> on your source code, this will generate a <code>PredicateEditor.strings</code> file with the following entries:</p>

<pre><code>""%[Field1]@ %[contains]@ %@"" = ""%[Field1]@ %[contains]@ %@"";
""%[Field2]@ %[contains]@ %@"" = ""%[Field2]@ %[contains]@ %@"";
</code></pre>

<p>You would change the values to be:</p>

<pre><code>""%[Field1]@ %[contains]@ %@"" = ""%[Abc]@ %[contains]@ %@"";
""%[Field2]@ %[contains]@ %@"" = ""%[Def]@ %[contains]@ %@"";
</code></pre>

<p>Then, when you create your <code>NSPredicateEditor</code>, you would set the <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/NSRuleEditor_class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004576-CH1-SW4""><code>formattingStringsFileName</code></a> property to <code>""PredicateEditor""</code>, and the editor will take care of the rest.</p>

<p><strong>With an <code>NSDictionary</code></strong></p>

<p>This would follow the same fundamental concepts as the .strings option, except that you would essentially do:</p>

<pre><code>NSDictionary *formatting = @{
  @""%[Field1]@ %[contains]@ %@"" : @""%[Abc]@ %[contains]@ %@"",
  @""%[Field2]@ %[contains]@ %@"" : @""%[Def]@ %[contains]@ %@""
}
[myPredicateEditor setFormattingDictionary:formatting];
</code></pre>

<p>That's all you have to do.</p>

<p>This isn't really possible, but not for the reason you think.  <code>DDMathParser</code> can parse <code>if</code> just fine.  It's the curly braces it would have issues with.  You could maybe do:</p>

<pre><code>if ($a &gt; 0) ($b / $c) else ($b * 1000)

<pre><code>multiply(multiply(if(l_gt($a,0)),divide($b,$c)),else(multiply($b,1000)))

","115730","","<p>Congratulations, you've discovered an implementation detail!  </p>

<p>First off, Contacts stores dates as points in time, and it is impossible to store a point in time without a year, because every point in time has a year.  Thus, a decision had to be made about how Address Book would store an ""unknown"" year in a date.  It was decided that ""1604"" would be a fine year, for several reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>When you're talking about Address Book, it is unlikely that you'll have anyone in your address book who was born in 1604.</li>
<li>1604 was a leap year (by the rules of how leap years are calculated), which means that if the person whose birth year you don't know was born on February 29th, then 1604 could handle that, too.</li>
<li>1604 was before the Julian-Gregorian calendar switch.</li>
</ol>

<p>Thus, if you're pulling birthdates out of Address Book, you'll need to special-case 1604 as the ""birthdate where the year is unknown"".</p>

<p>Note:  To my knowledge, this is only supported when dealing with the Gregorian calendar.  For all other calendars, this behavior is undefined.</p>

<p>As an example, currentDate is set to 2012-10-01.  In this example nextWeek is always 2012-10-01.

Do I have the wrong date components configured, or is <code>setWeekOfMonth:</code> not supposed to work like that?</p>
","115730","","<p>So.... Let's start with an <code>NSDate</code> and an <code>NSCalendar</code>:</p>

<pre><code>NSDate *date = ...;
NSCalendar *cal = [NSCalendar currentCalendar];
</code></pre>

<p>Figure out what day of the week that date is:</p>

<pre><code>NSInteger weekdayOfDate = [cal ordinalityOfUnit:NSWeekdayCalendarUnit inUnit:NSWeekCalendarUnit forDate:date];
NSInteger numberOfDaysToStartOfCurrentWeek = weekdayOfDate - 1;
</code></pre>

<p>Let's move that date into the next week:</p>

<pre><code>NSDateComponents *oneWeek = [[NSDateComponents alloc] init];
[oneWeek setWeek:1]; // add one week
[oneWeek setDay:-numberOfDaysToStartOfCurrentWeek]; // ... and subtract a couple of days to get the first day of the week
NSDate *startOfNextWeek = [cal dateByAddingComponents:oneWeek toDate:date options:0];
</code></pre>

<p>At this point, you have a date that points to the first day of the next week.  Now we should verify that it's still in the same month:</p>

<pre><code>NSDateComponents *monthOfNextWeek = [cal components:NSMonthCalendarUnit fromDate:startOfNextWeek];
NSDateComponents *monthOfThisWeek = [cal components:NSMonthCalendarUnit fromDate:date];
if ([monthOfNextWeek month] != [monthOfThisWeek month]) {
  // the first day of the next week is not in the same month as the start date
}
</code></pre>

<p>When I run this, I get that the start of next week is 30 Dec 2012 (a Sunday, because my calendar's weeks start on Sunday).</p>

<p>If, however, I want the first day of the week to start on Monday, I can preface this code with:</p>

<pre><code>[cal setFirstWeekday:2]; // the first day of the week is the second day (ie, Monday, because Sunday = 1)
</code></pre>

<p>If I do this, then the <code>startOfNextWeek</code> results in 31 Dec 2012.</p>

<p>That's the ""generic currency sign"", which is what is used when the formatter doesn't have a specific known symbol to use.</p>

But if that is indeed the case (and I'm sorry, I don't have an iOS 5.1 device here to check), you could do a find-and-replace in the formatted string to replace the generic currency symbol with the Rupee symbol.</p>

"<p>I am using <code>DDMathParser</code> to parse formulas and calculate the results, which works great.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> </p>

<p>Is it possible to set variables to default values in case they do not exist in the substitution dictionary?</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<p>My formula <code>$a + $b</code> requires two variables <code>$a</code> and <code>$b</code>. However, my substitution dictionary contains only an value for variable key <code>a</code> (e.g. 1), but does not contain an key <code>b</code>. </p>

<p>What would be the preferred way to define variable <code>b</code> to be <code>0</code> as default value and avoid the parsing error message <code>""unable to resolve variable""</code>?</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>

<h2>Edit</h2>

<p>The way I am using <code>DDMathParser</code> is by looping over multiple formulas and providing the same variable substitution dictionary to each formula. Sometimes, I don't have values for the variables: In this case the variables (keys and values) would not be included in the dictionary. </p>

<p>Depending on the formula itself, I would like to return <code>nil</code> as result for the formula if one of the variables does not exist (e.g. I don't have a value for <code>profit</code> and the formula is <code>$profit / $revenue</code>, I would like to return <code>nil</code> which I can convert to a <code>NSString</code> of <code>n/a</code> later) or set the variable to <code>0</code> if it is does not exist in the dictionary (e.g. for a formula like <code>$profitA + $profitB + $profitC</code>, I would like to assume <code>0</code> for any missing variables (<code>$profitA</code>, <code>$profitB</code> or <code>$profitC</code>). </p>

<p>For this reason, I cannot use a generic solution, which always returns <code>0</code> or <code>nil</code>, but would need to put this logic in the formula (e.g. as a custom function).</p>
","115730","","<p>DDMathParser author here.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is it possible to set variables to default values in case they do not exist in the substitution dictionary?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Kind of.  You could do it by supplying a <code>variableResolver</code> block to the math evaluator:</p>

<pre><code>DDMathEvaluator *evaluator = [DDMathEvaluator sharedMathEvaluator];
[evaluator setVariableResolver:^(NSString *variable) { return @0; }];
NSNumber *n = [evaluator evaluateString:myString withSubstitutions:mySubstitutions];
</code></pre>

<p>The variable resolver block gets executed whenever the evaluator comes across a variable that it can't find in the substitutions dictionary.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Would it be feasible to add a custom function to DDMathParser like defaultZero($b) which retrieves the variable b if it exists or zero if not?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hm, clever idea.  You could, but you would essentially by mimicking the behavior of the variableResolver block.  You'd create a new <code>DDMathFunction</code> block and use the <code>-[DDMathEvaluator registerFunction:forName:]</code> to tell the evaluator about it.</p>

<p>However, I'd recommend just supplying a variable resolver block.  It'd be much simpler.</p>

<hr>

<p>Here's how you'd define a <code>defaultZero</code> function that returns either the value of the argument or <code>0</code> (if the argument can't be evaluated):</p>

<pre><code>DMathEvaluator *evaluator = [DDMathEvaluator sharedMathEvaluator];
[evaluator registerFunction:^DDExpression *(NSArray *args, NSDictionary *vars, DDMathEvaluator *eval, NSError *__autoreleasing *error) {
    NSNumber *argValue = nil;
    if ([args count] == 1) {
        // defaultZero() only supports a single argument
        // for anything else, return 0
        DDExpression *arg = [args objectAtIndex:0];
        NSError *argError = nil;
        argValue = [eval evaluateExpression:arg withSubstitutions:vars error:&amp;argError];
    }

    if (argValue == nil) {
        // return 0 if either the arg can't be eval'd or there isn't 1 arg

I have heard that there is an easy way to do this with <code>DDMathParser</code> - It's why I switched from <code>GCMathParser</code>.</p>
","115730","","<p>DDMathParser author here.</p>

<p>Yes, this is very easy, and there are a couple of ways to go about it.  If you simply want what the numbers are and don't care about the operators, you can use the <a href=""https://github.com/davedelong/DDMathParser/wiki/Tokenizing"" rel=""nofollow"">tokenizing</a> API:</p>

<pre><code>NSError *tokenizingError = nil;
DDMathStringTokenizer *tokenizer = [DDMathStringTokenizer tokenizerWithString:@""5+900/32"" error:&amp;tokenizingError];
NSArray *tokens = [tokenizer tokens];

NSMutableArray *numbers = [NSMutableArray array];
for (DDMathStringToken *token in tokens) {
  if ([token tokenType] == DDTokenTypeNumber) {
    [numbers addObject:[token numberValue]];
  }
}

// numbers now is @[ @5, @900, @32 ];
</code></pre>

<p>There is, however, a caveat to this approach, and it can be best illustrated with this example:  <code>@""-42""</code>.  Tokens in DDMathParser are always parsed as <em>unsigned</em> numbers, because the minus sign in front is actually an operator and gets applied differently depending on other operators.  That means that if you tokenize the string <code>@""-42""</code>, you'll see that it contains <em>two</em> tokens: a negation operator, and the number 42.</p>

<p>Create a <code>CFDictionaryRef</code> with the provided default callback functions.  It'll do what you want.  Just don't call it an <code>NSDictionary</code>.</p>

<hr>

<p>Yes, you can create a <code>CFDictionaryRef</code> that retains its keys and does not copy them.  This is, in fact, the <em>default behavior</em> of a <code>CFDictionaryRef</code>.</p>

<p>The documentation for <code>CFDictionaryCreateMutable()</code> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the dictionary will contain only CFType objects, then pass a pointer to <code>kCFTypeDictionaryKeyCallBacks</code> as this parameter to use the default callback functions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(So if you're only going to be putting normal Objective-C objects into the array and not random things like <code>void *</code> pointers or whatever, this is what you want)</p>

<p>And the documentation for <code>kCFTypeDictionaryKeyCallBacks</code> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Predefined <code>CFDictionaryKeyCallBacks</code> structure containing a set of callbacks appropriate for use when the keys of a CFDictionary are all CFType-derived objects.
  The retain callback is <code>CFRetain</code>, the release callback is <code>CFRelease</code>, the copy callback is <code>CFCopyDescription</code>, the equal callback is <code>CFEqual</code>. Therefore, if you use a pointer to this constant when creating the dictionary, keys are automatically retained when added to the collection, and released when removed from the collection.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that the <code>retain</code> callback is <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/CoreFOundation/Reference/CFTypeRef/Reference/reference.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001203-CH201-F11072"" rel=""nofollow""><code>CFRetain()</code></a> and not something like <code>CFCopyObject</code> (which doesn't actually exist).</p>

<p>In fact, Core Foundation doesn't have a canonical way to ""copy any object"", which is why functions like <code>CFStringCreateCopy</code>, <code>CFArrayCreateCopy</code>, <code>CGPathCreateCopy</code>, etc exist.</p>

<p>So, what you can do is create your dictionary like this:</p>

<pre><code>CFDictionaryRef dict = CFDictionaryCreateMutable(NULL, 0, &amp;kCFTypeDictionaryKeyCallBacks, &amp;kCFTypeDictionaryValueCallBacks);
</code></pre>

<p>And you now have a dictionary that retains its keys and does not copy them.</p>

<p>I'm going to put the following bit in big letters so that you grok what I'm about to say:</p>

<h1>This dictionary you've created is not an <code>NSDictionary</code>.</h1>

<p>Yes, <code>NSDictionary</code> and <code>CFDictionaryRef</code> are toll-free bridged.  But casting this <code>CFDictionaryRef</code> to an <code>NSDictionary</code> would be an abuse of that bridging, because of this line in the <code>NSDictionary</code> documentation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...a key can be any object (provided that it conforms to the <code>NSCopying</code> protocol—see below)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Similarly, the documentation for <code>-[NSMutableDictionary setObject:forKey:]</code> explicitly says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The key is copied (using <code>copyWithZone:</code>; keys must conform to the NSCopying protocol).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The keys in your dictionary don't have to conform to <code>&lt;NSCopying&gt;</code> and are not copied using <code>-copyWithZone:</code>, which means your dictionary is NOT an <code>NSDictionary</code> (or <code>NSMutableDictionary</code>).  Any time you see <code>NSDictionary</code> used in code, you should be providing a key-value map where the keys are <em>copied</em> (not retained).  That is the API contract.  To do anything else could result in undefined behavior.</p>

<p>(The fact that some objects override <code>-copy</code> to <code>return [self retain]</code> is an implementation detail and is not relevant to this discussion on ""what is an <code>NSDictionary</code>"".)</p>

<p><em>P.S. I know that the maker of DDMathParser is often sighted in this neck of the woods. I am secretly hoping that he will come to the rescue and either fix my problem so I can implement it myself or him make it part of DDMathParser! :)</em>  </p>
","115730","","<p>So, I've thought a lot about this question since you posted it a month ago.  From what I understand, you're constructing a string as the user clicks/taps buttons.</p>

<p>I think this is your problem.</p>

<p>As the user taps buttons, you should be constructing (or modifying) <code>DDExpression</code> objects.  This is the ""pure"" format of a math expression, whereas a string is lossy and difficult to manipulate.  The string you show to the user should be generated from the <code>DDExpression</code> tree you're building.</p>

<p>This is a complex problem, and I'm still not entirely sure how I would go about implementing this, but this is the root of how I'd do it.  I would <em>not</em> just construct a string based on what the user types.  </p>

","115730","","<p>You set the locale of the date formatter using the appropriate <code>NSLocale</code> object.</p>

<p>Also, be wary of hard-coded date formats like that.  Your users may not like seeing dates in that format, so you should run the format string through <code>+[NSDateFormatter dateFormatFromTemplate:options:locale:]</code> first.

"<p>I am new to programming. I want to add some new functions such as derivatives and integrations to <code>ddmathparser</code>. The only one I can find is the short tutorial on <code>ddmathparser</code>'s wiki page <a href=""https://github.com/davedelong/DDMathParser/wiki/Adding-New-Functions"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/davedelong/DDMathParser/wiki/Adding-New-Functions</a> . However, I can't follow it because it's too short and after reading it several times, I still can't understand what it's doing. So can anyone elaborate steps to add a new function or give me some more detailed tutorials of doing this? 
I really did my research but I can't find one. Thanks very much. </p>

<p>Here's how you add a <code>multiply by two</code> function:</p>

<pre><code>DDMathEvaluator *evaluator = [DDMathEvaluator sharedMathEvaluator];
// a function takes arguments, variable values, the evaluator, and an error pointer
// and returns a new expression
[evaluator registerFunction:^DDExpression *(NSArray *args, NSDictionary *vars, DDMathEvaluator *eval, NSError *__autoreleasing *error) {
    DDExpression *final = nil;

    // multiplyBy2() can only handle a single argument
    if ([args count] == 1) {
        // get the argument and simply wrap it in a ""multiply()"" function
        DDExpression *argExpression = [args objectAtIndex:0];
        DDExpression *twoExpression = [DDExpression numberExpressionWithNumber:@2];
        final = [DDExpression functionExpressionWithFunction:DDOperatorMultiply arguments:@[argExpression, twoExpression] error:nil];
    } else if (error) {
        // there wasn't only one argument
        NSString *description = [NSString stringWithFormat:@""multiplyBy2() requires 1 argument.  %ld were given"", [args count]];
        *error = [NSError errorWithDomain:DDMathParserErrorDomain code:DDErrorCodeInvalidNumberOfArguments userInfo:@{NSLocalizedDescriptionKey: description}];
    }
    return final;

} forName:@""multiplyBy2""];
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can do:</p>

<pre><code>NSNumber *result = [@""multiplyBy2(21)"" stringByEvaluatingString];
</code></pre>

<p>and get back <code>@42</code>.</p>

<hr>

<p>What's going on here:</p>

<p>Internally, <code>DDMathEvaluator</code> essentially has a big <code>NSDictionary</code> where it keeps a list of all the functions it knows about, keyed off the name of that function, kind of like this:</p>

<pre><code>_functions = @{
  @""multiply"" : multiplyFunctionBlock,
  @""add"" : addFunctionBlock,
  ...
};
</code></pre>

<p>(Obviously it's a bit more complicated than that, but that's the basic idea)</p>

<p>When the evaluator evaluates a string and comes across the a function, it looks up in this dictionary what the block for the function is.  It retrieves the block, and then executes the block with the arguments (if there are any) from the string.  The result of the block is the result of the function.</p>

<p>That result gets substituted back in, and evaluation continues.</p>

<p>There are two things wrong, and one thing suboptimal.</p>

<ol>
<li>Wrong - You can't call this function ""sum"".  <a href=""https://github.com/davedelong/DDMathParser/wiki/Built-in-Functions"" rel=""nofollow"">""sum"" is a built-in function</a>, and <a href=""https://github.com/davedelong/DDMathParser/wiki/Adding-New-Functions"" rel=""nofollow"">built-in functions cannot be overridden</a>.</li>
<li>Wrong - The first parameter of your function is: <code>""2x""</code>.  That's fine, except that <code>x</code> is being interpreted as a <em>function</em>, but inside your for loop you're treating <code>x</code> as if it were a variable.  You either need to fundamentally alter how your function works, or use the form <code>2 * $x</code> (or just <code>2$x</code>) as the first parameter to your function.</li>
<li>Suboptimal - Instead of getting the <code>doubleValue</code> off the evaluated arguments, just get the <code>integerValue</code> instead and avoid the whole double-to-int conversion.</li>
</ol>

<p>Here's how I'd clean up your function (although you should probably do a bit more in the way of filling in the <code>error</code> out parameter):</p>

<pre><code>[evaluator registerFunction:^DDExpression *(NSArray *args, NSDictionary *vars, DDMathEvaluator *eval, NSError *__autoreleasing *error) {
    DDExpression *final = nil;
    if ([args count] == 3) {
        DDExpression *expr = [args objectAtIndex:0];
        DDExpression *start = [args objectAtIndex:1];
        DDExpression *end = [args objectAtIndex:2];
        //get the start and end values
        NSInteger startValue = [[eval evaluateExpression:start withSubstitutions:vars error:error] integerValue];
        NSInteger endValue = [[eval evaluateExpression:end withSubstitutions:vars error:error] integerValue];

        double sum = 0;
        for (NSInteger i = startValue; i &lt;= endValue; i++) {
            NSDictionary *substitution = @{@""x"": @(i)};
            NSNumber *value = [eval evaluateExpression:expr withSubstitutions:substitution error:error];
            sum += [value doubleValue];
        }
        final = [DDExpression numberExpressionWithNumber:@(sum)];
    }
    return final;
} forName:@""sum2""];
</code></pre>

<p>With this, you can do <code>sum2(2*$x, 2, 4)</code> and it will evaluate to 18.</p>

<h2>terminate:</h2>

<p>Terminates the receiver.</p>

<pre><code>- (void)terminate:(id)sender
</code></pre>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<p><em>sender</em></p>

<p>Typically, this parameter contains the object that initiated the termination request.</p>

<h3>Discussion</h3>

<p>This method is typically invoked when the user chooses Quit or Exit from the application’s menu.</p>

<p>When invoked, this method performs several steps to process the termination request. First, it asks the application’s document controller (if one exists) to save any unsaved changes in its documents. During this process, the document controller can cancel termination in response to input from the user. If the document controller does not cancel the operation, this method then calls the delegate’s <code>applicationShouldTerminate:</code> method. If <code>applicationShouldTerminate:</code> returns <code>NSTerminateCancel</code>, the termination process is aborted and control is handed back to the main event loop. If the method returns <code>NSTerminateLater</code>, the application runs its run loop in the <code>NSModalPanelRunLoopMode</code> mode until the <code>replyToApplicationShouldTerminate:</code> method is called with the value <code>YES</code> or <code>NO</code>. If the <code>applicationShouldTerminate:</code> method returns <code>NSTerminateNow</code>, this method posts a <code>NSApplicationWillTerminateNotification</code> notification to the default notification center.</p>

<p>Do not bother to put final cleanup code in your application’s <code>main()</code> function—it will never be executed. If cleanup is necessary, perform that cleanup in the delegate’s <code>applicationWillTerminate:</code> method.</p>

<p>Available in OS X v10.0 and later.</p>

"<p>A few threads here discuss the new iOS 6 Xcode error that pops up in the console when sending nil dates to Calendar methods:</p>

<pre><code>-[__NSCFCalendar components:fromDate:toDate:options:]: fromDate cannot be nil
I mean really, what do you think that operation is supposed to mean with a nil fromDate?
An exception has been avoided for now.
A few of these errors are going to be reported with this complaint, then further 
violations will simply silently do whatever random thing results from the nil.
</code></pre>

<p>The error made me chuckle a bit, but got me to thinking....</p>

<p>The code I've written that results in this error takes date information from a multitude of sources (from date formatters, strings, user input, etc), and I really don't expect every date that is supplied to be valid - I know full well that some will be nil, and I'm quite happy dealing with the results of such objects.</p>

<p>When I first started programming in Objective C one of the features I read up on was <a href=""http://www.numbergrinder.com/2009/01/nil-vs-nil-vs-null-the-uses-and-abuses-of-null-objects/"" rel=""nofollow"">sending messages to nil objects</a>. This was great because it meant that I didn't have to worry about passing around nil objects.</p>

<p>Now I've got a grumpy error message from Xcode telling me that I've sent a message to a nil object.</p>

<p>Is the inference now that I've got to check every object is not nil before using it in methods? Am I doing something totally heinous working with nil objects?</p>

<p>Incorrect.  Your <code>NSCalendar</code> (the receiver) is <em>not</em> nil.  What's <code>nil</code> is the <code>NSDate</code> you're passing as one of the arguments to the method.  <code>NSCalendar</code> doesn't have any clue what to do when you give it a nil <code>NSDate</code>, so it gives you a log message instead of throwing an exception and crashing your app.</p>

"<p>I'm implementing a scripting language where the user might be causing an endless loop by accident. I want to give the user the opportunity to cancel such a runaway loop by holding down the command key while typing the period (""."") key.</p>

<p>Currently, once for every line, I check for cancellation with this code:</p>

<pre><code>NSEvent *   evt = [[NSApplication sharedApplication] nextEventMatchingMask: NSKeyDownMask untilDate: [NSDate date] inMode: WILDScriptExecutionEventLoopMode dequeue: YES];
if( evt )
{
    NSString        *   theKeys = [evt charactersIgnoringModifiers];
    if( (evt.modifierFlags &amp; NSCommandKeyMask) &amp;&amp; theKeys.length &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; [theKeys characterAtIndex: 0] == '.' )
    {
        // +++ cancel script execution here.
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem with this is that it eats any keyboard events that the user might be typing while the script is running, even though scripts should be able to check for keypresses. Also, it doesn't dequeue the corresponding NSKeyUp events. But if I tell it to dequeue key up events as well, it might dequeue the keyUp for a keypress that was being held before my script started and my application might never find out the key was released.</p>

<p>Also, I would like to not dequeue any events until I know it is actually a cancel event, but there is no separate dequeue call, and it feels unreliable to just assume the frontmost event on a second call will be the same one. And even if it is guaranteed to be the first, that would mean that the user typing an 'a' and then Cmd-. would mean I only ever see the 'a' and never the Cmd-. behind it if I don't dequeue events.</p>

<p>Is there a better option than going to the old Carbon stand-by GetKeys()? Fortunately, that seems to be available in 64 bit.</p>

<p>Also, I'm thinking about adding an NSStatusItem that adds a button to cancel the script to the menu bar or so. But how would I process events in a way that doesn't let the user e.g. select a menu while a script expects to be ruler of the main thread?</p>

<p>Any suggestions? Recommendations?</p>
","115730","","<p>I would suggest using an event monitor.  Since you're asking <code>NSApp</code> for events, it would seem that you're running the script in the current process, so you only have to monitor events in your own process (and not globally).</p>

<p>There are several ways to do this (subclassing <code>NSApplication</code> and overriding <code>-sendEvent:</code>, putting in an event tap, etc), but the easiest way to do this would be with a <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSEvent_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000016-SW17"" rel=""nofollow"">local event monitor</a>:</p>

  // check the runloop mode
  // check for cmd-.

  return event;
}];

<p>When you're all done monitoring for events, don't forget to unregister your monitor:</p>

"<p>I'm using GCD to load my UITableView data on the background thread, however doing so mixes up the data in my custom UITableViewCell. The titleLabel and imageView on the cell are fine, but the textLabel (the subtitle) is wrong on every cell. This doesn't happen when the data is loaded on the main thread, and the data doesn't come from multiple arrays, so I can only guess it's because of my use of GCD, which I am new to.</p>

<p>Firstly, I set up the NSOperationQueue like so...</p>

<pre><code>- (void)setUpTableForAlbums
{
   dispatch_async(dispatch_get_global_queue(0, 0), ^
               {
                   [self setUpTableForAlbumsFD];

for (MPMediaItemCollection *collection in fullArray)
{
    item = [collection representativeItem];
    NSString *albumName = [item valueForProperty:MPMediaItemPropertyAlbumTitle];

}
}

<p>The Album custom class is just a container for the data.</p>

<p>Am I using GCD correctly, or is there another way I should be doing it?</p>
","115730","","<p>Yikes.  There are lots of things that are, shall we say, <em>interesting</em> about this code.  Let's start with the first method:</p>

<pre><code>NSOperationQueue *operationQueue = [[NSOperationQueue alloc] init];
NSInvocationOperation *operation = [NSInvocationOperation alloc];

operation = [operation initWithTarget:self selector:@selector(setUpTableForAlbumsFD) object:nil];
[operation setCompletionBlock:^
{
  [albumTable reloadData];
}];
[operationQueue addOperation:operation];
operation = nil;
</code></pre>

<p>What I think you're tying to do is execute the <code>-setUpTableForAlbumsFD</code> method in the background, and then when it's done, reload the tableView.</p>

<p>First, the <code>completionBlock</code> doesn't execute on the main thread (which is where you MUST call <code>-reloadData</code> from).  The docs say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The exact execution context for your completion block is not guaranteed but is typically a secondary thread. Therefore, you should not use this block to do any work that requires a very specific execution context.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The simpler way to do this method would be:</p>

<pre><code>dispatch_async(dispatch_get_global_queue(0,0), ^{
  [self setUpTableForAlbumsFD];
  dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{
    [albumTable reloadData];
  }
});
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Now for the <code>setUpTableForAlbumsFD</code> method...</p>

<pre><code>- (void)setUpTableForAlbumsFD {
    type = @""Albums"";
    queryAlbums = [MPMediaQuery albumsQuery];
    [queryAlbums setGroupingType:MPMediaGroupingAlbum];

    mainArrayAlbum = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init];

    NSArray *fullArray = [queryAlbums collections];
    for (MPMediaItemCollection *collection in fullArray) {
        item = [collection representativeItem];
        NSString *albumName = [item valueForProperty:MPMediaItemPropertyAlbumTitle];
        NSString *albumArtist = [item valueForProperty:MPMediaItemPropertyArtist];

        NSArray *paths = NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(NSDocumentDirectory, NSUserDomainMask, YES);
        NSString *documentsPath = [paths objectAtIndex:0];
</code></pre>

<p>You should do these two lines of finding the <code>NSDocumentDirectory</code> outside of the <code>for</code> loop, for efficiency.</p>

<pre><code>        NSString *filePath = [documentsPath stringByAppendingPathComponent:[NSString stringWithFormat:@""%@.png"", albumName]];

        UIImage *artwork = [UIImage imageImmediateLoadWithContentsOfFile:filePath];
</code></pre>

<p>I'm assuming this is a <code>UIImage</code> category method?</p>

<pre><code>        Album *album = [[Album alloc] init];
        album.albumTitle = albumName;
        if (album.albumTitle.length &gt; 4) {
            if ([[NSString stringWithFormat:@""%c%c%c%c"", [album.albumTitle characterAtIndex:0], [album.albumTitle characterAtIndex:1], [album.albumTitle characterAtIndex:2], [album.albumTitle characterAtIndex:3]] isEqual: @""The ""]) {
</code></pre>

<p>Yikes!  Just do: <code>if ([album.albumTitle hasPrefix:@""The ""]) {</code></p>

<pre><code>                album.albumOrderTitle = [album.albumTitle substringWithRange:NSMakeRange(4, album.albumTitle.length-4)];
</code></pre>

<p>And here do: <code>album.albumOrderTitle = [album.albumTitle substringFromIndex:4];</code></p>

<pre><code>            } else {
                album.albumOrderTitle = album.albumTitle;
            }
        } else {
            album.albumOrderTitle = album.albumTitle;
</code></pre>

<p>When you see multiple lines that are doing the same thing like this, it's a sign you can pull it out and do it differently.  For example, you could <em>always</em> set the <code>album.albumOrderTitle</code> to the <code>albumTitle</code>, and then only do something different if the albumTitle length is more than 4 and it has a prefix of @""The "".</p>

<pre><code>        }
        album.albumArtist = albumArtist;
        album.albumArtwork = artwork;
        if (![mainArrayAlbum containsObject:album]) {
            [mainArrayAlbum addObject:album];
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Your <code>cellForRowAtIndexPath:</code> is similarly convoluted:</p>

<pre><code>MasterCellAlbum *albumCell = [[MasterCellAlbum alloc] init];
</code></pre>

<p>You should be using <code>UITableView</code>'s cell-reuse mechanism.</p>

<pre><code>alphabet = [self alphabet:@""album"" withIndex:YES];
[albumCell setSelectionStyle:UITableViewCellEditingStyleNone];
NSString *alpha = [alphabet objectAtIndex:indexPath.section];
NSPredicate *predicate = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@""SELF.albumOrderTitle beginswith[c] %@"", alpha];
[cell setSelectionStyle:UITableViewCellSelectionStyleNone];

NSArray *predict = [mainArrayAlbum filteredArrayUsingPredicate:predicate];
</code></pre>

<p>Why are you re-filtering the <code>mainArrayAlbum</code> <em>every</em> time you need a cell?  It looks like you're always going to be grabbing the same <code>alphabet</code>, which means you're always going to be defining the same predicate, which means you're always going to be ending up with the same <code>predict</code> array.</p>

<pre><code>Album *album1 = [predict objectAtIndex:indexPath.row];
albumCell.titleLabel.text = album1.albumTitle;
albumCell.textLabel.text = album1.albumArtist;
if (album1.albumArtwork) {
    albumCell.avatarImageView.image = album1.albumArtwork;
} else {
    albumCell.avatarImageView.image = [UIImage imageNamed:@""albumArtInvertedLight1.png""];
}

longPress = [[UILongPressGestureRecognizer alloc] initWithTarget:self action:@selector(albumLittleMenu:)];
[albumCell addGestureRecognizer:longPress];
return albumCell;
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>So, there are some obvious places where your code can use some improvement.  Honestly, I think the answer to the problem you're having is because you're trying to reload the tableview on a background thread, which is a Bad Idea™.</p>

<p>To expand on <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/16585241/115730"">Jonathan's answer</a>, here's how you could do it entirely in DDMathParser.  However, to parse the string as-is, you'll need to do two things.</p>

<p>First, you'll need to create an <code>if</code> function:</p>

<pre><code>DDMathEvaluator *evaluator = [DDMathEvaluator sharedMathEvaluator];
[evaluator registerFunction:^DDExpression *(NSArray *args, NSDictionary *vars, DDMathEvaluator *eval, NSError *__autoreleasing *error) {
    if ([args count] == 3) {
        DDExpression *condition = [args objectAtIndex:0];
        DDExpression *resultExpression = nil;
        NSNumber *conditionValue = [condition evaluateWithSubstitutions:vars evaluator:eval error:error];
        if ([conditionValue boolValue] == YES) {
            resultExpression = [args objectAtIndex:1];
        } else {
            resultExpression = [args objectAtIndex:2];
        }
        NSNumber *result = [resultExpression evaluateWithSubstitutions:vars evaluator:eval error:error];
        return [DDExpression numberExpressionWithNumber:result];
    }
    return nil;

} forName:@""if""];
</code></pre>

<p>This creates the <code>if()</code> function, which takes three parameters.  Depending on how the first parameter evaluates, it either evaluates to the result of the second or third parameter.</p>

<p>The other thing you'll need to do is tell the evaluator what <code>height</code> and <code>weight</code> mean.  Since they don't start with a <code>$</code> character, they get interpreted as functions, and not variables.  If they started with a <code>$</code>, then it would be as simple as evaluating it like this:</p>

<pre><code>NSString *expression = @""if(($height &gt; 0), ($weight+ 2 ), ( $weight-1 ) )"";
NSDictionary *variables = @{@""height"" : @42, @""weight"" : @13};
NSNumber *result = [expression evaluateWithSubstitutions:variables evaluator:evaluator error:nil];
</code></pre>

<p>However, since they <em>don't</em> start with a <code>$</code>, they're functions, which means you need to tell the evaluator what the functions evaluate to.  You could do this by creating functions for both <code>height</code> and <code>weight</code>, just like you did for <code>if</code>:</p>

<pre><code>[evaluator registerFunction:^DDExpression *(NSArray *args, NSDictionary *vars, DDMathEvaluator *eval, NSError **error) {
    return [DDExpression numberExpressionWithNumber:@42];
} forName:@""height""];
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, you could make it a bit more dynamic and use the <code>functionResolver</code> block of <code>DDMathEvaluator</code>, which is a block that returns a block (woooooo) and would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>NSDictionary *values = @{@""height"": @42, @""weight"": @13};
[evaluator setFunctionResolver:^DDMathFunction(NSString *name) {
    DDMathFunction f = ^(NSArray *args, NSDictionary *vars, DDMathEvaluator *eval, NSError **error) {
        NSNumber *n = [values objectForKey:name];
        if (!n) { n = @0; }
        return [DDExpression numberExpressionWithNumber:n];
    };
    return f;
}];
</code></pre>

<p>With those two pieces in place (registering <code>if</code> and providing the values of <code>height</code> and <code>weight</code>), you can do:</p>

<pre><code>NSString *expression = @""if((height &gt; 0), (weight+ 2 ), ( weight-1 ) )"";
NSNumber *result = [expression evaluateWithSubstitutions:nil evaluator:evaluator error:nil];
</code></pre>

<p>... and get back the proper result of <code>@15</code>.</p>

<p>(I have plans to make <code>DDMathParser</code> allow unknown functions to fall back to provided variable values, but I haven't quite finished it yet)</p>
"
"<p>I would like to make a function which would allow me to pass a string in the argument - what's the best way to do this?</p>

<p>eg..
Moles(""Ca(OH)2"")</p>

<p>Any help would be extremely gratefully received.</p>
","115730","","<p>I ended up putting this in by parsing strings as variables.  So for DDMathParser:</p>

<pre><code>someFunction(""Hello"")
</code></pre>

<p>... is equivalent to:</p>

<pre><code>someFunction($Hello)
</code></pre>

<p>However, this means you can have variables now with more complex stuff:</p>

<pre><code>someFunction(""Hello world"")
Moles(""Ca(OH)2"")

"<p>Which is considered the better way to derive a new dictionary from an original one:</p>

<pre><code>[NSDictionary dictionaryWithDictionary:otherDictionary];
</code></pre>

<p>or </p>

<pre><code>[otherDictionary copy];

<p>? </p>

<p>From time to time we need to make a mutable dictionary out of an immutable one, and so this question keeps coming in. Maybe there is none, but I'm curious to see if in some use cases one is better than the other.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: I do know the above methods cannot be used to derive a <em>mutable</em> dictionary. I just wanted to ask the question in a general way, and then explain how I face this question from day to day. I should've been more clear about that.</p>
","115730","","<p>Actually, they <em>are</em> different, but not for the reason you expect.  I'm going to assume you're using ARC (and if you're not, why not?), so the auto-releasedness of the returned object doesn't matter.</p>

<p>Here's how they differ: consider what happens if <code>otherDictionary</code> is <code>nil</code>.</p>

<p>Well, if you use:</p>

<pre><code>[otherDictionary copy]; // or -mutableCopy
</code></pre>

<p>You'll get back <code>nil</code>, because you have a <code>nil</code> receiver.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you use:</p>

<pre><code>[NS(Mutable)Dictionary dictionaryWithDictionary:otherDictionary];
</code></pre>

<p>You <em>will</em> get back an <code>NS(Mutable)Dictionary</code>, regardless of whether <code>otherDictionary</code> is <code>nil</code> or not.</p>

<p>This is nice in the situation where you need to create a copy of a dictionary <em>and want an <code>NSDictionary</code> instance afterwards</em>, but you don't want to test for <code>nil</code> (yay for reducing cyclomatic complexity!).</p>

"<p>I'm struggling to add a new function (nCr) to DDMathParser. I've tried to follow these instructions by the author of DDMathParser:</p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/15599814/2521277"">http://stackoverflow.com/a/15599814/2521277</a></p>

<p>My problem: I can't manage to combine DDExpressions to a complex expression with variables...</p>

<p>Can you help me to add the function nCr (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient#Factorial_formula"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient#Factorial_formula</a>)</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>
","115730","","<p>DDMathParser author here.</p>

<p>The basic signature for all functions is this:</p>

<pre><code>DDExpression* ^(NSArray *arguments, NSDictionary *variables, DDMathEvaluator *evaluator, NSError **error);
</code></pre>

<p>So you need to create one of these blocks that implements the nCr algorithm.  There are a couple of ways you could do it:</p>

<ol>
<li>You could implement the function exactly as shown in the article, calculating the factorials, doing the subtraction, and doing the division.</li>
<li>You could implement the function wholly in terms of the existing factorial, subtraction, and division functions.</li>
<li>You could do a combination of the two.</li>
</ol>

<p>Personally, I'd recommend the last one, because <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization"" rel=""nofollow"">it saves having to re-evaluate the arguments</a>, but also means you don't have to write most of the logic yourself.</p>

<p>It'd be something like this:</p>

<pre><code>DDMathFunction nCrFunction = ^(NSArray *args, NSDictionary *vars, DDMathEvaluator *eval, NSError **error) {
  if ([args count] != 2) {
    *error = [NSError errorWithDomain:DDMathParserErrorDomain code:DDErrorCodeInvalidNumberOfArguments userInfo:@{NSLocalizedDescriptionKey : @""nCr requires 2 arguments""}];
    return nil;
  }

  DDExpression *first = [args objectAtIndex:0];
  DDExpression *second = [args objectAtIndex:1];

  NSNumber *n = [first evaluateWithSubstitutions:vars evaluator:eval error:error];
  if (n == nil) { return nil; }

  NSNumber *k = [second evaluateWithSubstitutions:vars evaluator:eval error:error];
  if (k == nil) { return nil; }

  // some validation here to guarantee that 0 ≤ k ≤ n

  // now, re-box the numbers in expressions to pass off to other functions
  DDExpression *nExpression = [DDExpression numberExpressionWithNumber:n];
  DDExpression *kExpression = [DDExpression numberExpressionWithNumber:k];

  // build the algorithm
  DDExpression *f1 = [DDExpression functionExpressionWithFunction:DDOperatorFactorial arguments:@[kExpression] error:error]; // k!

  // the other half of the denominator
  DDExpression *subtract = [DDExpression functionExpressionWithFunction:DDOperatorMinus arguments:@[nExpression, kExpression] error:error]; // (n-k)
  DDExpression *f2 = [DDExpression functionExpressionWithFunction:DDOperatorFactorial arguments:@[subtract] error:error]; // (n-k)!

  // the full denominator
  DDExpression *denominator = [DDExpression functionExpressionWithFunction:DDOperatorMultiply arguments:@[f1, f2] error:error]; // k!(n-k)!

  // the numerator
  DDExpression *numerator = [DDExpression functionExpressionWithFunction:DDOperatorFactorial arguments:@[nExpression] error:error]; // n!

  // the whole thing
  DDExpression *final = [DDExpression functionExpressionWithFunction:DDOperatorDivide arguments:@[numerator, denominator] error:error]; // n!/(k!(n-k)!)

  return final;
};
</code></pre>

<p>With this block, you can register the function on your <code>DDMathEvaluator</code>:</p>

<pre><code>[[DDMathEvaluator sharedMathEvaluator] registerFunction:nCrFunction forName:@""nCr""];
</code></pre>

<p>That's it!</p>

<p>Now you can do:</p>

<pre><code>NSNumber *n = [@""nCr(4, 3)"" numberByEvaluatingString];
</code></pre>

"<p>I have a view controller, named AllThingsViewController that dynamically creates other view controllers, named ThingViewController, and adds their top level view to a UIScrollView. (I'm writing proprietary code so I've changed the names of my classes, but the structure of my code is exactly the same.)</p>

<p>Here's what its loadView method contains:</p>

<pre><code>NSArray *things = [[ThingDataController shared] getThings];

if ([things count] == 0) {
    // code in this block is not relevant as it's not being executed...
} else {

    for(unsigned int i = 0; i &lt; [things count]; ++i) {
        ThingViewController *thingViewController = [[ThingViewController alloc] init];
        [thingViewController loadView];

        [scrollView addSubview:thingViewController.topView];
        thingViewController.topView.frame = CGRectNewOrigin(thingViewController.topView.frame,
                0, thingViewController.topView.frame.size.height*i);

        [thingViewController displayThing:thing[i]];
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>ThingViewController's loadView method looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)loadView
{
    NSArray *topLevelObjs = nil;
    topLevelObjs = [[NSBundle mainBundle] loadNibNamed:@""ThingView"" owner:self options:nil];
    if (topLevelObjs == nil)
    {
        NSLog(@""Error: Could not load ThingView xib\n"");
        return;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>When my app starts up everything displays correctly, until I try to tap one of the buttons that exists in the xib being loaded by ThingViewController, at which point it crashes due to an exception: ""unrecognized selector sent to instance"". It seems that ARC is releasing my ThingViewController instances too early.</p>

<p>Looking at my code, I figured it was because they weren't being held on to anything, so I created an NSMutableArray as an instance variable in my AllThingsViewController class, and started adding the ThingViewControllers to it thusly:</p>

<pre><code>NSArray *things = [[ThingDataController shared] getThings];

if ([things count] == 0) {
    // not being executed...
} else {

    for(unsigned int i = 0; i &lt; [things count]; ++i) {
        ThingViewController *thingViewController = [[ThingViewController alloc] init];
        [thingViewController loadView];

        [scrollView addSubview:thingViewController.topView];
        thingViewController.topView.frame = CGRectNewOrigin(thingViewController.topView.frame,
                0, thingViewController.topView.frame.size.height*i);

        [thingViewController displayThing:thing[i]];

        [allThingsViewControllers addObject:thingViewController];
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, it didn't change anything, even though those objects are being added to the array. Finally, just to confirm that this is ARC releasing it early, I changed ""thingViewController"" to be an instance variable in AllThingsViewController and changed:</p>

<pre><code>ThingViewController *thingViewController = [[ThingViewController alloc] init];
</code></pre>

<p>to be:</p>

<pre><code>thingViewController = [[ThingViewController alloc] init];
</code></pre>

<p>Sure enough, the last item in the scrollable list doesn't crash when I tap its buttons, but the other ones do, because its ThingViewController isn't being deallocated.</p>

<p>I'm still relatively new to ARC, but after a bunch of Googling I have no idea how to fix this. What do I do?</p>

    thingViewController.topView.frame = CGRectNewOrigin(thingViewController.topView.frame,

    [billViewController displayThing:thing[i]];

    [allBillViewControllers addObject:billViewController];

","115730","","<p>Generally, I find that working with <code>NSWindowControllers</code> makes dealing with windows <em>much</em> simpler.  In your case, your App Delegate wouldn't own the window directly, but would instead own the <code>NSWindowController</code> that owns the window.</p>

","115730","","<p>Some would probably argue that the way it is <em>meant</em> to be done is in Interface Builder.

<p>Let's go through an example of how this all works together, and then you can decide which approach works best for you:</p>

<li>You have an object with two <code>NSString</code> properties: <code>bar</code> and <code>baz</code></li>

<p>Granted, this is a lot of typing just to create row templates.  I understand that.  I just think that it's also very explicit and easy to debug.  That being said, you can also configure this exact same thing in Interface Builder.  To do so, put an <code>NSPredicateEditor</code> in your xib, and give it 3 row templates.  The Compound row template you'd leave alone, but the other two you'd change to be configured like this:</p>

<p>For the ""<code>bar</code>"" template:</p>

<p>For the ""<code>baz</code>"" template:</p>

<p>If you compare these screenshots to the code above, it should (hopefully) be easy to see how one maps to the other.  With the row templates configured like this, IB also shows the predicate editor in your window:</p>

<p>If you want to do more advanced things, such as creating custom row templates, or populating the list of allowed constant values with something from your data model, then you'll have to drop to doing the configuration in code.</p>

<p><strong>Edit to answer comment question</strong></p>

<p>The <code>modifier</code> bit of these selectors corresponds to the <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/DOCUMENTATION/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSComparisonPredicate_Class/Reference/NSComparisonPredicate.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001189-BBCJDIJH"" rel=""nofollow""><code>NSComparisonPredicateModifer</code></a> for the created <code>NSComparisonPredicate</code>.  There are three modifiers: Direct, Any, and All.</p>

<pre><code>@""bar = 'Bar1'"";
  ^ No modifier means this is NSDirectPredicateModifier

@""ANY user.userName = 'markjs'"";
  ^~~ use of ""ANY"" keyword means this is NSAnyPredicateModifier

@""ALL user.age &lt; 42"";
  ^~~ use of ""ALL"" keyword means this is NSAllPredicateModifier
</code></pre>

<p>In these three examples, they're all comparison predicates (because they have a left side, an operator, and a right side), but the use of ""ANY"" or ""ALL"" affects how the left side is interpreted.  If either is present, then the predicate is expecting the left-hand side to evaluate to a collection of possibilities.</p>

<p>Using the ""direct"" option (or <code>0</code>) basically means you're going to be doing a one-to-one comparison.</p>

"<p>Say I have an <code>NSArray</code>:</p>

<pre><code>@[@""Hello"", @""World"", @""Hello""]
</code></pre>

<p>Since there are two 'Hello's, I need to convert the array into:</p>

<pre><code>@[@""Hello(1)"", @""World"", @""Hello(2)""]
</code></pre>

<p>So 'Hello' has number appended, but 'World' won't have (1) appended as there is only one.</p>

<p>I know I can create a dictionary with the words as keys and iterate through the array, increment the count as their values, but is there a better way?</p>

<p>edit:</p>

<p>Yes I do need the result array to have the same order for words as the input array, the reason for this is that I'm making a vocabulary app for non-English speaking students, one of the feature is to have a translation(in their own language) of a sentence and a list of shuffled words for the sentence, they can then choose the words in the correct order from the list. So you may see the translation of 'How do you do?' in another language and the list of words: 'do' 'you' 'how' 'do', and the students need to select the words in the order of 'How do you do?', that's why I need to distinguish the order of same words.</p>
","115730","","<p><code>NSCountedSet</code> is definitely the way to go.  You can do it in a single pass if you use two of them: one to know how many there are total, and one to track how many you've seen so far:</p>

NSCountedSet *counts = [NSCountedSet setWithArray:a];

NSCountedSet *countsSoFar = [NSCountedSet set];

for (NSString *str in a) {
    if ([counts countForObject:str] &gt; 1) {
        // this object appears more than once.  append the number of times it's appeared so far
        [countsSoFar addObject:str];
        NSUInteger countSoFar = [countsSoFar countForObject:str];
        str = [str stringByAppendingFormat:@""(%ld)"", countSoFar];
    }
    [final addObject:str];
}

NSLog(@""%@"", final);

This behavior makes me feeling very bad about every Objective-C category I declare because I want the categories I declare to be available <strong>only in the scopes</strong> they are declared within.

<p>There are no namespaces on Objective-C objects.  If you declare that a class has a method (whether via a category or on the primary <code>@interface</code>) then <em>every</em> instance of that class will have that method.</p>

<p>The way that Objective-C deals with ""private"" methods is by choosing not to tell other people about the methods in question (which is accomplished by not <code>#import</code>-ing the file that declares those methods).  This, coupled with <code>-Wundeclared-selector</code> (warn if you use a selector that the compiler doesn't know about) is about as good of a guard as you're going to get.</p>

<p>But regardless, if you compile the .m file into your final binary, the method <em>will</em> exist, even if no one else ""knows"" about it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are there way to avoid this behavior? I do want my categories to work only when I explicitly import them, not just when I have them linked to a target I use to run.</p>

<p>Yeah, use <code>-Wundeclared-selector</code>, and Xcode will warn you.</p>

<p>I think, it's something related to timezone, any ideas.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>solved :</p>

<pre><code>[df setTimeZone:[NSTimeZone timeZoneWithName:@""GMT""]];
</code></pre>

<p>As I thought, it's related to timezone.</p>
","115730","","<p>Congratulations, you've found more timezone oddities!  You're correct that changing your time zone will fix the issue.  Let's go spelunking and see if we can figure out why!</p>

<p>First, we'll try and find every timezone where this weirdness happens:</p>

<pre><code>NSArray *tzs = [NSTimeZone knownTimeZoneNames];
NSDateFormatter *f = [[NSDateFormatter alloc] init];
f.dateFormat = @""MMyyyy"";
for (NSString *name in tzs) {
    f.timeZone = [NSTimeZone timeZoneWithName:name];
    NSDate *date = [f dateFromString:@""062008""];
    if (date == nil) {
        NSLog(@""%@"", name);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is going to loop through all known timezones and try to parse ""062008"" in that time zone.  If we run this, we find that it logs:</p>

<pre><code>Africa/Casablanca
Asia/Karachi
</code></pre>

<p>So I'm guessing that you live in either Casablanca or Karachi (because by default, your <code>NSDateFormatter</code> is initialized with <em>your</em> timezone, which is why you're seeing this problem; probably Casablanca, given that you appear to be 1 hour ahead of GMT).</p>

<p>Let's see if we can figure out what's weird with those timezones:</p>

<pre><code>$ zdump -v Africa/Casablanca
... snip ...
Africa/Casablanca  Sun Jun  1 00:00:00 2008 UTC = Sun Jun  1 01:00:00 2008 WEST isdst=1
... snip ...

$ zdump -v Asia/Karachi
... snip ...
Asia/Karachi  Sat May 31 19:00:00 2008 UTC = Sun Jun  1 01:00:00 2008 PKST isdst=1
... snip ...
</code></pre>

<p>Sure enough, it looks like both Casablanca and Karachi skipped the midnight hour on June 1st in 2008.  Thus, you're essentially giving it an unparse-able date, and it's returning <code>nil</code>.  In a nutshell.</p>

<p>In this case, the correct answer <em>is</em> to change your timezone (GMT is probably a great choice), because chances are this string you're parsing is not coming from user input (given its weird format), and thus should be parsed according to a standard timezone.  And although I'm sure that Casablanca and Karachi are really neat places, their timezones aren't exactly common ones...</p>

","115730","","<p>It looks like you're trying to parse the output of an object's <code>-description</code> method.  Do not do that.  That format is undefined and may change from release to release.</p>

<p>Instead, you should use the object's properties to retrieve the information you need.  In this case, the string indicates that the ""DisplayName"" is ""Alex's ipad"".

","115730","","<p>According to the constraints you have, the top of the view is a certain distance from the top, and the bottom of the view is a certain distance from the bottom.  So it's not really a <em>square</em> view, it's just a view that looks like a square.</p>

<p>The reason why it's showing up as smaller is that it looks like a square when the view is run on a 4"" screen.</p>

<p>But your simulator isn't a 4"" screen (which you can clearly see because the height of the view in the simulator does not match the height of the view in Interface Builder).</p>

</code></pre>

<p>are not guaranteed to return the same underlying font across versions or even different uses.  His example was Lucinda Grande.  He did not seem to be saying that using ""HelveticaNeue-Italic"" could go away from version to version.</p>

<p>So I constructed an experiment in iOS 7.  I created my font with the following code:</p>

<pre><code>UIFontDescriptor *fontDescriptor = [UIFontDescriptor fontDescriptorWithName:@""Helvetica Neue"" size:16.0];
UIFontDescriptor *symbolicFontDescriptor = [fontDescriptor fontDescriptorWithSymbolicTraits:UIFontDescriptorTraitItalic];

UIFont *fontWithDescriptor = [UIFont fontWithDescriptor:symbolicFontDescriptor size:16.0];
</code></pre>

<p>I did get a valid UIFont back for fontWithDescriptor and when I queried the font for the fontName with:</p>

<pre><code>[fontWithDescriptor fontName]
</code></pre>

<p>I got back...  </p>

<pre><code>HelveticaNeue-Italic
</code></pre>

<p>Go figure???</p>

<p>So a possible answer to 7.0.3 seems to be the code above.</p>

<p>----  Further Tweak  ----</p>

<p>Although the solution worked above, I don't think it is formally correct.  I have switched to the following solution</p>

<pre><code>    UIFontDescriptor *fontDescriptor = [[UIFontDescriptor alloc] init];

    UIFontDescriptor *fontDescriptorForHelveticaNeue = [fontDescriptor fontDescriptorWithFamily:@""Helvetica Neue""];
    UIFontDescriptor *symbolicFontDescriptor = [fontDescriptorForHelveticaNeue fontDescriptorWithSymbolicTraits:UIFontDescriptorTraitItalic];

    textFont = [UIFont fontWithDescriptor:symbolicFontDescriptor size:textFontPointSize];
</code></pre>

<p>This appears to do all the right things.  I tried the previous approach with another font family and it seemed to get confused with a the fontName and the fontFamily.  Hope this helps!</p>
","115730","","<p>This is a bug in iOS 7.0.3.</p>

<p>If you are explicitly using HelveticaNeue-Italic, then you can create it using this workaround:</p>

<pre><code>UIFont* font = (__bridge_transfer UIFont*)CTFontCreateWithName(CFSTR(""HelveticaNeue-Italic""), fontSize, NULL);
</code></pre>

<p>Note, however, that this workaround will <em>only</em> work on iOS 7; it is not deployable to iOS 6 (because <code>CTFontRef</code> and <code>UIFont</code> were not toll-free bridged on iOS 6).  However, on iOS 6 you can just use your regular font lookup code.</p>

"<p>I'm curious to know if any of the Cocoa frameworks contain an initializer that might be mistaken for dealing with a human being. Obvious methods, (although I don't know if or where they exist) are <code>initWithAge</code>, or <code>initWithName</code>. </p>

<p>Are there any really clever sounding Cocoa initializers that may be applicable to people?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>I'm certainly not asking about the <code>new</code> operator. This is the kind of question you might get at a trivia event, but I'm absolutely serious about this. It can be answered objectively and definitively. Are there any cleverly named Cocoa initializers that can be understood to refer to people?</p>
","115730","","<p>So, I <em>think</em> you're asking this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is there an established convention for initializing an object that describes a person?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, the first thing I would do is grep through the framework headers looking for references to ""person"":</p>

<pre><code>$ cd /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.9.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks
$ grep -r 'Person\b' . | edit
</code></pre>

<p>(Yes, I default to looking in the Mac SDK.  Looking in the iOS SDK will be left as an exercise to the reader)</p>

<p>This results in 381 hits for me, mostly duplicated information.  But there are a couple of interesting hits:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>ABPerson</code> from AddressBook.framework</li>
<li><code>EKParticipant</code> from EventKit</li>
<li><code>PSAuthor</code> from PubSub</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Unfortunately</strong>, none of these results have an initializer, because they're all mainly for interacting with existing Person objects, not for creating new ones.  The exception is <code>-[ABPerson(ABPerson_vCard) initWithVCardRepresentation]</code>.  That's probably not helpful.</p>

<p>So we need to keep digging.  How else might we describe a person?  ""People""? ""Member""? ""Individual""? ""Customer""?  All of these would be pretty good things to look for.</p>

<p>And then I remembered that there's this obscure framework buried deep inside the OS X SDK that no one ever really talks about, called Collaboration.framework:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Collaboration framework is a set of Objective-C classes that allows developers to monitor identities and their attributes. (<a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Networking/Reference/Collaboration_Coll/_index.html"">reference</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That looks promising!  And indeed, looking in here there's really interesting class: <code>CBIdentity</code>.  A <code>CBIdentity</code> ""is used for accessing the attributes of an identity"".  There are a bunch of different ways to create an identity, but I like this pattern, and I would recommend doing it like this:</p>

<p>An ""MBIdentity"" class would define ways to canonically identify a person.  So you could have <code>-initWithSocialSecurityNumber:</code> or <code>-initWithName:</code> or <code>-initWithBirthLocation:time:</code>, etc.  The purpose of this class would be to establish a collection of attributes that are sufficient to identify an individual.</p>

<p>Your ""MBPerson"" class would then have an <code>-initWithIdentity:</code> method that takes an <code>MBIdentity</code>.  The Person would then take on the characteristics of its composed Identity.</p>

<p>I suppose the important thing to realize here is that there are many ways to establish <em>identity</em> (and hence many properties/initializers on an <code>MBIdentity</code>).  But once you've established an identity, only one <em>Person</em> has that identity (and so your <code>Person</code> class only has an <code>initWithIdentity:</code> method).</p>
"
"<p>I have class <code>A</code>, which exposes a way of getting and setting an object of type <code>Foo</code>. In property parlance, I generally declare this in the interface:</p>

<pre><code>@property (nonatomic, strong) Foo * foo;
</code></pre>

<p>This (in modern ObjC) generates both the accessors and an ivar, <code>_foo</code> for storage.</p>

<p>If I want to do custom work in the accessors, I can implement one or both of them myself. But what if I not only want to do custom work, I actually don't want the ivar? In other words, I'm doing something else with the Foo object, like handing it back and forth to another internal object that I'm composed with. I don't actually need to keep storage for <code>foo</code> in the instance of <code>A</code> at all.</p>

<p>It seems like I have two choices:</p>

<ol>
<li>Declare the property, implement both accessors, and simply ignore the fact that the compiler creates storage for <code>_foo</code>, and never use it. </li>
<li>Declare my accessors explicitly: <code>- (Foo *)foo</code> and <code>- (void)setFoo:(Foo *)foo</code> in the interface, like I used to in pre-modern ObjC.</li>
</ol>

<p>The first seems inelegant at runtime, and the second seems inelegant in the declaration (where I'd probably now have a mix of properties and property-like accessors).</p>

<p>Is there a way to declare a property and have it serve as purely a declaration?</p>
","115730","","<p><code>@dynamic</code> is probably the way to go.</p>

<p>However, there are two other ways you can do this as well:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>An Unimplemented Category</p>

<p>You can use an un-implemented category to declare a property, but not get the backing storage:</p>

<pre><code>@interface Foo : NSObject
@end

@interface Foo (UnimplementedProperties)
@property (strong) id bar;
@end

@implementation Foo
@end
</code></pre>

<p>By not declaring the implementation of the category (<code>@implementation Foo (UnimplementedProperties)</code>), the properties won't be synthesized.</p></li>
<li><p>A Protocol</p>

<p>You can declare the properties on a protocol, and then make your class conform to that protocol.  This has the same effect as the unimplemented category: the methods are declared, but the properties are not synthesized.</p>

<pre><code>@protocol FooProperties &lt;NSObject&gt;
@property (strong) id bar;
@end

@interface Foo : NSObject &lt;FooProperties&gt;

@end

","115730","","<p>If you want to perform the paste action in your own app, then you can use the Responder Chain to send the <code>paste:</code> action to the first responder:</p>

<p>The documentation says what happens when you pass <code>nil</code> as the <code>to:</code> parameter:</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>However, if you want to perform the paste action in <em>another</em> app, there's no real good way to do that.  The best you can hope for is to perform a ""pretend"" <kbd>cmd</kbd>-<kbd>v</kbd> operation and hope that that means ""paste"" in the target app...</p>

<p>Yes, it will change the <em>class</em> of the instance.  However, it will not change the <em>size</em> of it.  So if your <code>SubClassView</code> declares extra properties or instance variables that are not declared on <code>SuperClassView</code>, then your attempts to access them on this frankenstein instance will result in (at best) buffer overflows, (probably) corrupted data, and (at worst) your app crashing.</p>

"<p>I have a two dimensional  NSArray in Objective C.</p>

<p>I'd like to know the total # of items in the array.
Without using nested for loops, is there a faster way to get the total # of items?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","115730","","<p>Yeah, you can do this key-value coding and <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/cocoa/conceptual/KeyValueCoding/Articles/CollectionOperators.html"">the collection operators</a>:</p>

<pre><code>NSArray *nested = @[@[@1, @2, @3],    @[@4, @5, @6],    @[@7, @8, @9],
                    @[@10, @11, @12], @[@13, @14, @15], @[@16, @17, @18],
                    @[@19, @20, @21], @[@22, @23, @24]];
NSLog(@""%@"", [nested valueForKeyPath:@""@sum.@count""]); // logs 24 (as an NSNumber)
</code></pre>

<p>A couple of comments:</p>

<p>The key path <code>@sum.@count</code> works by first creating an array of the counts (so <code>@[@3, @3, @3, @3, @3, @3, @3, @3]</code>) and then summing up that array (to give <code>@24</code>).</p>

<p>However, this is only ""faster"" in the sense that <em>you</em> write less code. Fundamentally, it's still doing the same thing that you would be doing yourself. And it's potentially less efficient, because it's dealing with the addition of <code>NSNumbers</code>, which isn't as efficient as the addition of primitives (which you would likely be using).</p>

<p>Is it really that much more difficult to do:</p>

<pre><code>NSUInteger total = 0;
for (NSArray *array in nested) {
  total += array.count;
}

"<p>I have the following NSObject subclass. How do I find the ""weight"" of it in terms of bytes? I understand that the pointer to this object is 16 bytes (I got that info from  <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13670185/how-much-memory-is-reserved-when-initializing-nsobject"">How much memory is reserved when initializing NSObject?</a>)</p>

@property(nonatomic,strong) NSArray *personEmailIDTypes;
@property(nonatomic,strong) NSData *personImageData;

@end
</code></pre>

<p>For example, NSString takes 1 byte, NSArray takes 'n' bytes etc. Is there a definitive way of calculating it?</p>

<p>My goal is to find if I collect 500 of these from the iPhone Address book inside NSArray, will it eat too much RAM of the iPhone.</p>
","115730","","<p>On a 64-bit system, pointers are 8 bytes each, so we  can expect that your 8 properties (plus one for the isa defined in <code>NSObject</code>) to take up 72 bytes. On a 32-bit system, it'd take up half of that.</p>

<p>We can verify this with a handy method in the Objective-C runtime called <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/ObjCRuntimeRef/Reference/reference.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001418-CH1g-SW38"" rel=""nofollow""><code>class_getInstanceSize</code></a> that will tell us how ""large"" a single allocation of a class would be:</p>

<pre><code>NSLog(@""%lu"", class_getInstanceSize([PersonRecord class]));
</code></pre>

<p>As expected, this logs ""72"" on a 64-bit system, and ""36"" on a 32-bit system.</p>

<p>However, Hot Licks is right to point out that this is only the size of the pure <code>PersonRecord</code>. It does not include the size of the data pointed to by any of the properties. You could have only a single <code>PersonRecord</code> and yet still run out of memory, if you tried to load up hundreds of gigabytes into a string and put it into that <code>PersonRecord</code>'s <code>personName</code> field.</p>

<p>Before you go optimizing this object definition to try and squeeze every last byte that you can out of it, you should always measure your app first, and only optimize if and only if you have measured and have <em>proof</em> that there is a problem.</p>

<p>But... using back-of-the-envelope calculations, 500 of these is only 36,000 bytes, and if we estimate that each one of these 500 objects might be pointing to another 1,000 bytes of data, then we're looking at 536,000 bytes: less than half a megabyte of allocations. You're probably not going to have a problem with this. But again: MEASURE MEASURE MEASURE.</p>

","115730","","<p>If you want to format a number as currency, then you need to use <code>NSNumberFormatter</code>. However, the other answers are wrong because they tell you to use the wrong <code>numberStyle</code> or tell you to change the format string. These are both incorrect.</p>

<p>First, you want an <code>NSNumberFormatter</code>:</p>

<pre><code>NSNumberFormatter *formatter = [[NSNumberFormatter alloc] init];
</code></pre>

<p>Next, you need to tell it you're going to be formatting things for currency:</p>

<pre><code>formatter.numberStyle = NSNumberFormatterCurrencyStyle;
</code></pre>

<p>Optionally, if you want things to be formatted in a specific currency, you <em>may</em> set the currency code:</p>

<pre><code>formatter.currencyCode = @""USD"";
</code></pre>

<p>Optionally, if you want things to be formatted according to the locale settings that are not the user's default locale, you <em>may</em> set the locale:</p>

<pre><code>formatter.locale = [NSLocale localeWithLocaleIdentifier:@""en_GB""];
</code></pre>

<p>If you were to run those four lines of code, you would get an <code>NSNumberFormatter</code> that formats an <code>NSNumber</code> in US Dollars, but according to the Great Britain locale. The locale is what defines the placement of the currency symbol (before or after the number), the decimal separator (<code>.</code> vs <code>,</code>), the thousands separator (<code>,</code> vs <code></code>), and so on.</p>

<p>The currency code defines what the currency symbol is (<code>$</code> vs <code>£</code>, etc).</p>

<p>By default, the locale is <code>[NSLocale currentLocale]</code>, and the currency code is the code for the current locale.</p>

<p>One very very very important thing to remember, however, is that this only <em>formats</em> currency for you. It does <em>not</em> perform any currency <em>conversion</em> for you. It assumes that whatever <code>NSNumber</code> you give it is <em>already</em> in units of the target currency.</p>

<p>From this I see a couple of things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Run Loops exit as soon as they've found something to do. Notice how in both the <code>performSelector</code> and <code>dispatch_async</code> cases, the run loop gets to checking sources, but never gets to the ""BeforeWaiting"" stage like it does afterwards.</li>
<li>Run Loops do as much of a single thing as they can. In both cases, the run loop executes <em>both</em> <code>performSelectors</code> and both <code>dispatch_asyncs</code>. </li>
<li>Run Loops prefer performing selectors overs dispatching blocks. Remember how we dispatched before performing the selector? Yet the selector was performed before the blocks were executed. I'm guessing that whatever mechanism the run loop has for doing this executes selector performance at a higher priority (or simply earlier).</li>
<li>Re-entrancy doesn't change this. If you uncomment the <code>[[NSRunLoop mainRunLoop] runUntilDate...]</code> code, the order of things does not change, and both blocks and selectors are performed up re-entering the run loop.</li>

"<p>I'm running into a frustrating problem with a parentheses completion algorithm. The math library I'm using, DDMathParser, only processes trigonometric functions in radians.

"<p>I just  watched the WWDC video #216, ""Building Adaptive UI with UIKit.""</p>

<p>At about 45:10 Tony Ricciardi talks about changes to IB in Xcode 6 to support the new changes. </p>

<p>He says ""You can deploy these documents backwards to older versions of iOS"".</p>

<p>(where ""These documents"" presumably means XIBs and storyboards that have specific settings for different size classes.)</p>

<p>I'm not making this up. Go watch the WWDC video.</p>

<p>How is that possible? Trait collections and size classes are only defined in iOS 8. How can runtime behavior that's dependent on UI constructs that are new to iOS 8 work in previous iOS versions?</p>

<p>If it <strong>is</strong> possible it would be wonderful. You could build apps that will run on iOS 6, 7, and 8, and take advantage of the new flexible UI layout abilities that Apple has added to Xcode 6. I've created adaptive UI logic myself in code, and it's quite a bit of work. </p>
","115730","","<p>When deploying your app to iOS 7, Xcode will compile your storyboard in two different ways:</p>

<li><p>For iPad, your storyboard gets compiled as ""Regular-Regular"" and gets packaged as your ""~ipad"" nib.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So if you're looking to deploy to both iOS 7 and iOS 8, you should focus your design on the Compact-Any and Regular-Any size classes. That will give you the best experience in terms of matching the UI across deployment targets. You are, of course, welcome to modify the layout for other size classes, but unless those modifications would get applied to the Compact-Regular or Regular-Regular size classes, then you would not see those modifications on iOS 7.</p>

"<p>In Swift, super's initializer should be called after all properties of the current class have been initialized.  This is however not done for Objective-C init, where super init is called first before initializing properties in the current class.</p>

","115730","","<blockquote>
  <p>What issues is Swift trying to prevent by enforcing this?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a great question, and Objective-C did not avoid it.</p>

<p>The problem is that while you're inside an initializer method, the object is technically in a partially constructed state. <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/25598145/115730"">Bryan's post</a> is a great (albeit contrived) example of why. The general issue is that if a super class's initializer invokes a method, a subclass may have overridden this method. That, in and of itself, is not a bad thing. The problem arises if the overridden method <em>assumes</em> that the object is totally constructed.</p>

<p>However, since the object is still in the midst of invoking the initializers, that is not the case. The object is not wholly constructed until the call to <code>[super init]</code> returns and the class of the object executes any of its initialization code.</p>

<p>There's a related problem with <code>dealloc</code> methods: if you invoke methods inside your <code>-dealloc</code> method, those methods may assume that the object is wholly constructed, when in fact it may be partially deconstructed. This isn't as big of a deal under ARC, but it can still lead to some very subtle bugs.</p>

<p>With Swift, the decision was made to avoid these class of problems by enforcing this rule:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By the time you decide to call <code>super</code>, the calling class must have finished any class-specific initialization.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A variant of this rule is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You may not invoke methods until after you have called <code>super</code>'s initializer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With this rule, you will never run into the problem described above.</p>

"<p>I wanted to make a test app for the Apple watch in which you can set some String on your phone, and then it will be displayed on the Apple Watch. I decided to use NSUserDefaults class to store this data. </p>

<p>In my view controller for the iPhone I have a method which takes the input and stores into local storage:</p>

<pre><code>- (IBAction)saveInfo:(id)sender {

    NSString *userInput = [myTextField text];

    NSUserDefaults *defaults = [NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults];

    [defaults setObject:userInput forKey:@""savedUserInput""];

    [defaults synchronize];

    self.myLabel.text = [defaults stringForKey:@""savedUserInput""];
}
</code></pre>

<p>And in my watch interface controller I have a method that retrieves the data and displays it:</p>

<pre><code>- (IBAction)showText2 {

    NSUserDefaults *defaults = [NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults];

    [defaults synchronize];

    self.myLabel2.text = [defaults stringForKey:@""savedUserInput""];
}
</code></pre>

<p>Except for some reason the data I am trying to retrieve is shown as null, and the label is not being updated. </p>
","115730","","<p><code>+standardUserDefaults</code> returns an <code>NSUserDefaults</code> object that only saves information for the current process.</p>

<p>If you want to create an <code>NSUserDefaults</code> object that shares data between your iOS app and one of its extensions, then you'll need to <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/General/Conceptual/ExtensibilityPG/ExtensionScenarios.html"">set up an app group container</a> and use that as the basis for sharing information.</p>

<p>From the linked documentation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After you enable app groups, an app extension and its containing app can both use the NSUserDefaults API to share access to user preferences. To enable this sharing, use the initWithSuiteName: method to instantiate a new NSUserDefaults object, passing in the identifier of the shared group. For example, a Share extension might update the user’s most recently used sharing account, using code like this:</p>

<pre><code>// Create and share access to an NSUserDefaults object.
NSUserDefaults *mySharedDefaults = [[NSUserDefaults alloc] initWithSuiteName:@""com.example.domain.MyShareExtension""];

// Use the shared user defaults object to update the user's account.
[mySharedDefaults setObject:theAccountName forKey:@""lastAccountName""];
</code></pre>

"<p>According to Apple's press info about the release of iOS 8.2 and Xcode 6.2 found <a href=""http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2014/11/18Developers-Start-Designing-Apps-for-Apple-Watch.html"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>, they mention developers being able to use the new technologies presented with the Apple Watch:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With the iOS 8.2 beta SDK, developers can now start using WatchKit to
  create breakthrough new apps, Glances and actionable notifications
  designed for the innovative Apple Watch interface and work with new
  technologies such as Force Touch, Digital Crown and <strong>Taptic Engine</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After combing through the WatchKit framework documentation, I have found no mention of using the Taptic Engine. Is there a way for developers to use it? Perhaps they haven't implemented that yet and it may come in a later update for iOS 8.2, but I don't think this is the case. What am I missing?</p>
","115730","","<p>Direct access to the Taptic Engine is not possible with the WatchKit framework. Taptic feedback would come as a result of your app (for example) receiving a push notification.</p>

"<p>To ask my question effectively, let's first consider the exact scenario I'm facing:</p>

<p><strong>General Setup</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>A host iOS 8 app.</li>
<li>One or more iOS 8 extensions (WatchKit, Share, etc.) bundled with the host app. </li>
<li>The host app and all extensions share the same Core Data SQLite store in the shared app group container.</li>
<li>Each app/extension has its own NSPersistentStoreCoordinator and NSManagedObjectContext.</li>
<li>Each persistent store coordinator uses a persistent store that shares the same SQLite resources in the group container as all the other persistent stores.</li>
<li>The app and all extensions use a common codebase for syncing content from a remote API resource on the Internet.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Sequence of Events Leading to the Problem</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>The user launches the host app. It begins fetching data from the remote API resource. Core data model objects are created based on the API response and ""upserted"" into the host app's managed object context. Each API entity has a uniqueID that identifies it in the remote API backend. By ""upsert,"" I mean that for each API entity, the host app only creates a new entry in Core Data if an existing entry for a given uniqueID cannot be found.</p></li>
<li><p>Meanwhile, the user also launches one of the host app's extensions. It, too, performs some kind of fetch from the same remote API. It also attempts to perform an ""upsert"" when parsing the API responses.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Problem:</strong> What happens if both the host app and an extension try to upsert a Core Data entry for the same API entity at the same time? To see how this could come about, let's look at the sequence of events for an upsert:</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Core Data Upsert Sequence:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>The API parsing code parses the uniqueID for a given API entity.</li>
<li>The parser performs a Core Data fetch for any entry that matches a predicate where <code>uniqueID</code> is equal to the parsed uniqueID.</li>
<li>If an existing entry is not found, the parser inserts a new Core Data entry for this API entity, set's its <code>uniqueID</code> attribute to the parsed uniqueID.</li>
<li>The parser saves the managed object context, which pushes the new entry data down to the SQLite backing store.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Problem in Detail</strong></p>

<p>Let's assume the host app and the extension are independently parsing an API response for the same API entity at the same time. If both the host app and an extension reach Step 3 before either of them has finished Step 4, then they will both be trying to insert a new Core Data entry for the same uniqueID. When they reach Step 4 and call <code>save:</code> on their respective managed object contexts, Core Data will happily create duplicate entries.</p>

<p>As far as I'm aware, Core Data doesn't have any way to mark an attribute as unique. I need a Core Data equivalent to a <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/15277374/1078579"">SQLite <code>INSERT OR IGNORE</code> + <code>UPDATE</code> combo.</a>. Or else I need a way to ""lock"" the persistent store's SQLite backing store, which sounds like a recipe for trouble.</p>

<p>Is there a known approach to this rather novel problem introduced by iOS 8 extensions?</p>
","115730","","<p>It seems like the simplest approach to this would be to simply avoid the multiple writers in the first place. Why not just drive your extensions entirely off cached data, and then only update your data store from your primary iOS app?</p>

"<p>The apple doc said <code>""When one of your app’s local or remote notification arrives on the user’s iPhone, iOS decides whether to display that notification on the iPhone or on Apple Watch""</code></p>

<p>And I want to know how can I display that notification on Apple Watch only? how can I display that notification on iPhone only? Apple support any property ?</p>

<p>Thx.</p>
","115730","","<p>There is no way to specify that a push notification should only be sent to the Apple Watch, and not to the iPhone.</p>

"<p>I developed a iOS app that uses Core Data framework and saves the persistent store in the application document directory.
Into the app terget I can retrieve the persistent store path using the following method:</p>

<pre><code>- (NSString *)applicationDocumentsDirectory {
    return [NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(NSDocumentDirectory, NSUserDomainMask, YES) lastObject];
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then I created a new WatchKit extension target and I want to retrieve the persistent store saved by the iOS app, <strong>but when I try to use the above method in the Interface Controller of the watch extension, it returns a different path</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>How can I find the persistent store path of the iOS app in the watchkit extesion target ?</strong> </p>
","115730","","<p>Your WatchKit Extension would not have permissions to access the Core Data store in your app's Documents directory, because that is outside of the extension's sandbox.</p>

<p>If you want your extension to be able to access the data store, then you need to put it in a place that both the app and the extension can access. <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/General/Conceptual/ExtensibilityPG/ExtensionScenarios.html"" rel=""nofollow"">I recommend reading up on App Group Containers</a> (the ""Sharing Data with Your Containing App"" section), which were added for this very purpose of sharing files between related apps and extensions.</p>
