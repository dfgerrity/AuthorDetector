"<p>I would like to know how to get the name of the property that a method parameter value came from. The code snippet below shows what I want to do:</p>

<pre><code>Person peep = new Person();
Dictionary&lt;object, string&gt; mapping = new Dictionary&lt;object, string&gt;();
mapping[peep.FirstName] = ""Name"";
Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt; propertyToStringMapping = Convert(mapping);
if (mapping[peep.FirstName] == propertyToStringMapping[""FirstName""])
  Console.WriteLine(""This is my desired result"");

private Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt; Convert(Dictionary&lt;object, string&gt; mapping)
{
   Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt; stringMapping = new Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt;();
   foreach (KeyValuePair&lt;object, string&gt; kvp in mapping)
   {
     //propertyName should eqal ""FirstName""
     string propertyName = kvp.Key??????
     stringMapping[propertyName] = kvp.Value;
   }
   return stringMapping;
}
</code></pre>
","33708","Mehrdad","<p>You are not able to do so in this way, since the way it works is that C# evaluates the value of FirstName property by calling its get accessor and passes the value of that to the indexer of the dictionary. Therefore, the way you found out FirstName value is completely lost. Just like the way you evaluate 2 + 2.
If you write, ""x = 2 + 2"", x will have the value 4 but there will be no way to tell if it was 3 + 1 or 2 + 2 or 5 + (-1) or ... that evaluated to 4.</p>

"<p>I've seen this syntax a couple times now, and it's beginning to worry me,</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>Google can't help, but I know SO can!</p>
","33708","Mehrdad","<p>It's the way you mention a generic method in C#.</p>

<p>When you define a generic method you code like this:</p>

<pre><code>return-type MethodName&lt;type-parameter-list&gt;(parameter-list)
</code></pre>

<p>When you call a generic method, the compiler usually infers the type parameter from the arguments specified, like this example:</p>

<pre><code>Array.ForEach(myArray, Console.WriteLine);
</code></pre>

<p>In this example, if ""myArray"" is a string array, it'll call Array.ForEach&lt;string&gt; and if it's an int array, it'll call Array.ForEach&lt;int&gt;.</p>

<p>Sometimes, it's impossible for the compiler to infer the type from the parameters (just like your example, where there are no parameters at all). In these cases, you have to specify them manually like that.</p>

"<p>If you have a WPF control library which you wanted to license to developers, how do enforce license restrictions such that the library could be used and distributed in their own applications and yet prevent the end-users from reusing that .dll?</p>

<p>I'm approaching this from a strict business perspective, so I'm trying to find a solution that wouldn't allow indiscriminating users to  do something as simple as pass the .dll around with the key and be able to share it.</p>

<p>Any thoughts on this are absolutely welcome and feel free to wax philosophical.</p>
","33708","Mehrdad","<p>Strictly speaking, these kind of problems are really hard to solve completely, and whatever you do, it WILL be possible (though it might be hard enough) to alter the IL code that validates the license and bypass the check completely. However, if you're really comfortable with it, you could force your clients to submit the compiled version of their application to you to apply a strong name to it (using your private key). This way, you can check the public key token of the calling assembly against a specific key that only you own. By no means I suggest such a method for generic use, but if it's REALLY THAT NECESSARY to do so, this could work. Just keep in mind that it would probably take a few hours to find the license checking code in your assembly and removing it altogether. This will render any license restriction useless!</p>

"<p>I have inherited a project that has class libraries written in VB.NET, some of these have "".settings"" files and the others have a "".dll.config"" file to store connection strings. What is the difference between these 2 methods?</p>

<p>EDIT: In what scenarios would I prefer one over the other?</p>
","33708","Mehrdad","<p>"".config"" files are at the core of .NET configuration system. They store the actual configuration data. In the early .NET framework, if you wanted to extend the configuration system to handle your custom configuration data, you had to do this manually. ""Settings"" file is a feature that allows you to visually define configuration options and use them to create a strongly typed class. This class can then be used as a method to read and manipulate the configuration data specified in application's "".config"" file at runtime. They also provide some neat features automatically, such as defining per-user or per-application configuration options. They greatly reduce the hassle to manually extend the configuration system.</p>

"<p>In <strong>classic ASP</strong> there is a global object called <strong>""Application""</strong> that is accessed simultaniously by all sessions.</p>

<p>As the ""Application"" object is a shared resource, can it cause <strong>dead locks?</strong></p>

<p>EDIT: If not, why does it has <strong>lock</strong> and <strong>unlock</strong> methods for? <a href=""http://www.w3schools.com/asp/asp_ref_application.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">Reference</a></p>
","33708","Mehrdad","<p><b>Deadlock</b> is different from normal <b>blocking</b>. Since pages are processed in different threads, if you want to prevent another request from modifying that shared resource, you use Lock, and to allow modification again, you use the Unlock method. The thing is, if you don't use those methods, <i>another request can change the value of an item in the application state, while you're relying on an old value</i>. Or two requests can try to modify it simultaneously and it might cause problems. Lock method causes a request to wait until the other request unlocks application; after that, it can continue. </p>

<p>Deadlock is a situation in which <i>thread A</i> <b>locks</b> <i>resource 1</i> and <b>waits</b> for <i>resource 2</i> to become available. At the same time <i>thread B</i>, which has <b>locked</b> <i>resource 2</i> needs to access <i>resource 1</i> (which is locked by <i>thread A</i>) to continue to work and be able to release the resource afterwards. In this situation, <b>none</b> of the threads can continue (one of them <b>has to be terminated</b> to allow continuation). This is a <b>deadlock</b>. Application.Lock will not cause deadlocks on its own if correctly used. But if it's not used correctly, it might cause deadlocks (when coupled with another shared resource that needs locking and deadlocks are not taken care of).</p>

"<p>The question is this, why do I need to add an ""import"" directive on my <strong>Site.Master</strong> file to get Intellisense when the html helpers work without it.</p>

<p>Using a simple C# string extension method without a namespace == no problem. However, I wanted to put this extension in a namespace to be a good programmer.</p>

<p>If I wrap it in a <strong>namespace</strong>, you have to do a couple of things. Here is my extension:</p>

<pre><code>namespace MySystemCore
{
    public static class StringExtensions
    {
        public static string F(this string s, params object[] args)
        {
            return string.Format(s, args);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So through trial and error, I have it working, but wanted to share my observations. Hopefully it may help someone else in the future.</p>

<p>NOTE: I am using the extension method in <strong>Site.Master</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Add ""using MySystemCore;"" to <strong>Site.Master.cs</strong> file (codebehind file)</p>

<ul>
<li>Runtime error, no extension method found</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Add ""<code>&lt;add namespace=""MySystemCore""&gt;</code>"" to <code>&lt;namespaces&gt;</code> configuration block in <strong>web.config</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Works, no intellisense</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Combine #1 and #2</p>

<ul>
<li>Works, no intellisense</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Add ""<code>&lt;%@ Import Namespace=""MySystemCore"" %&gt;</code>"" to <strong>Site.Master</strong> file</p>

<ul>
<li>Works, with intellisense</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
","33708","Mehrdad","<p>It's a VS limitation that when you add it to &lt;namespaces&gt; in <b>web.config</b>, IntelliSense doesn't show up.</p>

<p>But for the sake of completeness, I'll discuss the cause of it:
<li>Method 1 is not a correct way to do it at all, since <b>using</b> directives (<b>Imports</b> will compile down to <b>using</b> by <b>ASP.NET preprocessor</b>) are scoped to a compilation unit (i.e. a single file)</li>
<li>Method 2 runs OK since it adds the <b>using</b> directive to the compilation options, which affects all compilation units in the application. If IntelliSense doesn't show up in this case, that's because VS is not smart enough to consider <b>web.config</b>.</li>
<li>Method 3 is effectively, just like 2. Method 1 is totally unrelated to the master file, it only affects .cs file as I mentioned before. Method 2 is like adding using to all .cs files automatically.</li>
<li>Method 4 works because VS understands that you're using it in the same file as it's working on.</li></p>

"<p>I'm working with LINQ to objects and have a function where in some cases I need to modify the underlying collection before calling <code>Aggregate(...)</code> and then return it to its original state before the funciton returns the results of <code>Aggregate(...)</code>. My current code looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>bool collectionModified = false;
if(collectionNeedsModification)
{
    modifyCollection();
    collectionModified = true;
}

var aggregationResult = from a in
                            (from b in collection
                             where b.SatisfysCondition)

                        select a.NeededValue;

if(collectionModified)
    modifyCollection();

return aggregationResult;
</code></pre>

<p>However, as written, if I modify the collection, I will get the wrong result because I'm putting the collection back in its original state before <code>aggregationResult</code> is enumerated and LINQ results are lazy-evaluated. My current solution is to use <code>.ToArray()</code> on my LINQ query like this:</p>

<pre><code>var aggregationResult = (from a in
                            (from b in collection
                             where b.SatisfysCondition)

                         select a.NeededValue).ToArray();
</code></pre>

","33708","Mehrdad","<p>I don't think there is a problem with your approach if you'll always use the result (since your result set is not large, it'll not consume much memory. By the way, if you do this and never use the result, it'll impose a performance loss).

<p>In VisualStudioPro it used to be in project properties, the website properties in  Visual Web Developer 2008 Express seem very ... express.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

","33708","Mehrdad","<p>Visual Web Developer (prior to 2008 SP1) does not support Web Application projects. Default namespace is only available in Web Application projects.</p>

<p>If you really want to add your classes to a namespace, you should do it manually (the namespace surround with code snippet can prove pretty useful) by enclosing them in a namespace statement:</p>

<pre><code>namespace MyDefaultNamespace {

}

"<p>Not sure exactly how to word this question ... so edits are welcomed!  Anyway ... here goes.</p>

<p>I am currently use Crystal Reports to generated Pdfs and just stream the output to the user.  My code looks like the following:</p>

<pre><code>System.IO.MemoryStream stream = new System.IO.MemoryStream();

stream = (System.IO.MemoryStream)this.Report.ExportToStream(CrystalDecisions.Shared.ExportFormatType.PortableDocFormat);

this.Response.Clear();

this.Response.BinaryWrite(stream.ToArray());
this.Response.End();
</code></pre>

<p>After this code runs it streams the Pdf to the browser opening up Acrobat Reader.  Works great!  </p>

<p>My problem is when the user tries to save the file it defaults to the actual file name ... in this case it defaults to CrystalReportPage.pdf.  Is there anyway I can set this?  If so, how?  </p>

<p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

"<p>I'll be using the <a href=""http://www.codeplex.com/MSFTDBProdSamples/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=4004"" rel=""nofollow"">AdventureWorks Database</a> to illustrate my problem.</p>

<p>I need to show for a particular customer a list of OrderDate with the most Orders.</p>

<p>My intial attempt was as follows:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT CustomerID, OrderDate, COUNT(1) Cnt
FROM Sales.SalesOrderHeader
WHERE CustomerID = 11300
GROUP BY CustomerID, OrderDate
ORDER BY Cnt DESC
</code></pre>

<p>This will get us the following result:</p>

<pre><code>CustomerID    OrderDate				Cnt
-----------   ----------        		----
11300   	 2003-11-22 00:00:00.000	 2
11300   	 2004-01-28 00:00:00.000	 2
11300   	 2004-02-18 00:00:00.000	 2
11300   	 2004-02-08 00:00:00.000	 2
11300   	 2004-02-15 00:00:00.000	 1
11300   	 2004-03-11 00:00:00.000	 1
11300   	 2004-03-24 00:00:00.000	 1

11300   	 2004-04-28 00:00:00.000	 1
11300   	 2004-05-03 00:00:00.000	 1
11300   	 2004-05-17 00:00:00.000	 1
11300   	 2004-06-18 00:00:00.000	 1
...
</code></pre>

<p>Not exactly what I wanted, as the result should only show all records where Cnt = 2, like so:</p>

<pre><code>CustomerID    OrderDate				Cnt
-----------   ----------        		----
11300   	 2003-11-22 00:00:00.000	 2
11300   	 2004-01-28 00:00:00.000	 2
11300   	 2004-02-18 00:00:00.000	 2
11300   	 2004-02-08 00:00:00.000	 2
</code></pre>

<p>I'm stuck because I can't wrap my mind around two problems:</p>

<p>1) A customer might have more than one OrderDate with the same Cnt value. This means I can't do something like TOP 1 to get the desired result.<br />
2) Because the number of Orders for each customer may be different, I cannot use the following SQL statement:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT CustomerID, OrderDate, COUNT(1) Cnt
FROM Sales.SalesOrderHeader
WHERE CustomerID = 11300
GROUP BY CustomerID, OrderDate HAVING COUNT(1) &gt; 1
ORDER BY Cnt DESC
</code></pre>

<p>This will work for getting the right result for this customer, but will definitely be wrong if the next customer has only one Order for a particular day.</p>

<p>So, either the query is impossible in this situation, or I am approaching the query in the wrong way. Any ideas on this problem is appreciated. </p>

<p>Also, since this will be a query in a stored procedure, any ideas on solving this in T-SQL will be acceptable.</p>

","33708","Mehrdad","<p>You should use <code>TOP</code> <i><code>n</code></i> <code>WITH TIES</code> clause to accomplish the task:</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can use a <i>common table expression (CTE)</i> to solve the problem. This solution requires SQL Server 2005 or higher:</p>

<pre><code>WITH MyTable AS (SELECT CustomerID, OrderDate, COUNT(*) Cnt

<p>It's also a very flexible, well-designed framework. If you don't like part of it, or think its performance intensive for your high load application, you can just throw out that layer and replace it with your own. If you don't like WebControls and Pages due to its overhead, you are able to write your own <code>HttpHandler</code>s.</p>

"<p>When writing fairly typical Mac code in an OS X 10.5+ environment, what are the disadvantages to using garbage collection?</p>

<p>So far everything else I've written has been either 10.4 compatible or on the iPhone, so I've become fairly comfortable with retain/release, but now that I'm working on a larger project that's 10.5 only I'm wondering if there are any downsides to just going ahead and using the Objective-C 2.0 garbage collector.</p>

<p>What do you guys think?</p>
","33708","Mehrdad","<p>If there is the possibility to port your application to the iPhone, you shouldn't use it.</p>

<p>Garbage collection <b>might</b> have adverse effect on performance if you have special use cases. Without GC, you have precise control on destruction of the object, which is not the case GC world. In most projects, it's worth it to turn on GC as it's less error prone and easier.</p>

<p>In <b>theory</b>, memory management without GC can always be faster that with GC, however, it's not the case in most practical applications (since GC is usually more optimized that human being).</p>

"<p>I'm temporarily using gcc 2.95.2, and instead of having a <code>sstream</code> header, it defines a (slightly different, and deprecated) <code>strstream</code>. I'm currently getting around this with</p>

"<p>I know that in C#, if you write <code>~MyClass()</code>, this basically translates to <code>override System.Object.Finalize()</code>. So, whether you write the <em>destructor</em> or not, every type in CLR will have a <code>Finalize()</code> method in it (of <code>System.Object</code> at least).</p>

<p>1] So, does it mean that, every object, by default, <strong>has</strong> a finalizer ?</p>

<p>2] What is the basis for the CLR to decide that an object should be put through finalization queue ? </p>

<p>I'm asking this, because, I had a class, say <code>ManagedResourceHolder</code> that implemented <code>IDisposable</code>, but did not call <code>GC.SuppressFinalize(this)</code> in its <code>IDisposable.Dispose()</code> method. The class did not hold any unmanaged resources, and there was no need for the <code>~ManagedResourceHolder()</code> method, which in turn meant no need for the  <code>GC.SuppressFinalize(this)</code> call as there was no <em>finalizer</em>.</p>

<p>3] In context of the above scenario, is it <strong>always</strong> necessary to provide a finalizer when you implement IDisposable ? (even on a class that holds no unmanaged resources)</p>

<p>The FxCop rule <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms182269.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">CA1816</a> was giving me a violation on this and the response I got <a href=""http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vstscode/thread/4e8a3155-6f12-4888-9ca1-f6762761e038"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> when I asked in the CA forum on MSDN confused me.</p>

","33708","Mehrdad Afshari","<ol>
<li>Nope, it doesn't mean so. Only overridden <code>Finalize()</code> will count by the CLR.</li>
<li>By having a finalizer, as defined above.</li>
<li>Nope, it's not <b>always</b> necessary. It's just a nice pattern. I mean, nobody forces you to do so. But it's a good thing to do if you have unmanaged resources, since if somebody forgets to dispose it, the unmanaged resource will get released sometime. FxCop does not enforce strict rules. It enforces good patterns that may lead to failure in the future if you don't take care of.</li>
</ol>

<p>UPDATE: Every class is responsible for managing its own resources. Due to abstraction and encapsulation features of object-oriented paradigms, the consumer of a class should not care about what resources it has, indirectly. Therefore, you should either manually release the resources you own (what you own is what you <b>directly own</b> as you look at other things as a <b>black box</b>) or leave it to the GC to release them. For unmanaged resources, you don't have the option to leave it to the GC, so you have to release it manually. In this sense, a SafeHandle that Jon mentioned is a <b>managed abstraction of an unmanaged resource</b>, therefore it should be treated as a valuable managed resource (which is a black box that manages the finalization of that unmanaged resource itself).</p>

"<p>This is a somewhat bizarre question. My objectives are to understand the language design decision and to identify the possibilities of reflection in C++.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Why C++ language committee did not go towards implementing reflection in the language? Is reflection too difficult in a language that does not run on a virtual machine (like java)?</p></li>
<li><p>If one were to implement reflection for C++, what will be the challenges?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I guess the uses of reflection are well-known: editors can be more easily written, program code will be smaller, mocks can be generated for unit tests and so on. But it would be great if you could comment on uses of reflection too.</p>
","33708","Mehrdad Afshari","<p>Reflection requires some metadata about types to be stored somewhere that can be queried. Since C++ compiles to native machine code and undergoes heavy changes due to optimization, high level view of the application is pretty much lost in the process of compilation, consequently, it won't be possible to query them at run time. Java and .NET use a very high level representation in the binary code for virtual machines making this level of reflection possible. In some C++ implementations, however, there is something called Run Time Type Information (RTTI) which can be considered a stripped down version of reflection.</p>

","33708","Mehrdad Afshari","<p>In fact, <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code> <b>is already readonly</b>. It means you cannot alter any items in the underlying collection. You cannot alter the references to the <code>Person</code> type that are held in the collection. The return type is not read only, however, and since it's a reference type (i.e. a <code>class</code>), you can alter the original values through its reference. You should either use a <code>struct</code> as the return type (that makes a copy of the value each time it's returned, so the original value will not be altered, which can be costly, by the way) or use read only properties on the <code>Person</code> type to accomplish this task.</p>

"<p>We have IIS6 running on a 64-bit Windows 2003 server with 32Gb physical RAM.

<ol>
<li>To which extent can a strong-named assembly be verified to avoid tampering?</li>
<li>Is it possible to use strong-naming to verify an assembly author?</li>
</ol>

<p>The first question arises after reading the CSharp411 article <em><a href=""http://www.csharp411.com/net-assembly-faq-part-3-strong-names-and-signing/"" rel=""nofollow"">.NET Assembly FAQ – Part 3 – Strong Names and Signing</a></em>, which mentions this, among other problems of using strong names:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""<strong><em>Cannot Stop Full Replacement.</strong> Strong names cannot prevent a hacker from removing the strong name signature, maliciously modifying your assembly, re-signing it with his own key, and then passing off his assembly as yours.</em>""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The second question intends to find the differences between strong naming and other signing schemes like, say, <a href=""http://www.iss.net/security_center/advice/Countermeasures/Authentication/Authenticode/default.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">Authenticode</a>. The same MSDN article mentioned early states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""<em>Note, however, that strong names in and of themselves do not imply a level of trust like that provided, for example, by a digital signature and supporting certificate.</em>""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Am I trying to use strong-naming for much more than it was created for? Was strong-naming created just to avoid name clashes or a new kind of ""GAC DLL Hell""?</p>
","33708","Mehrdad Afshari","<p>Authenticode relies on a third party certificate authority for certificate validation. Strong naming works like a self-signed certificate and can be treated as such. It does use standard digital signatures, but the problem lies in verifying the public key of the assembly author is indeed valid.  If you get it separately via a trusted channel from the author and you trust that channel, then yes, you can verify it just like a self-signed certificate.</p>

<p>As long as you are sure the strong name private key is kept safe by the author and you know author's public key, you can make sure it's not tampered with (to the extent you can make sure a digitally signed email is not tampered with). By the way, don't get me wrong: the quote is completely true and an attacker can easily resign the assembly or remove the existing signature. However, the resulting assembly will have a *<em>different</em> digital signature that can be checked against the original (if you have the original public key).  </p>

<p>In this case, it's similar to a self-signed certificate. If you can somehow be sure of the author's public key, you can verify the authority. However, unlike Authenticode which relies on a certificate authority, there is no straightforward, system-defined, way to distribute the public key.</p>

<p>UPDATE: To clarify things about the comment, it's important to know the difference between  anonymous methods and lambda expressions. An anonymous method is just like a normal method, without an explicit name. When you compile it, the compiler generates a normal method with a weird name for you instead, so it will not have any special limitations. However, one representation of an anonymous method is a lambda expression. Lambda expressions can be interpreted in a couple different ways. The first is a delegate. In that way, they are equal to an anonymous method. The second is an expression tree. This way is normally used by LINQ to SQL and some other LINQ providers. They don't execute your expression directly by any means. They parse it as an expression tree and use the tree as input data to generate the equivalent SQL statement to be run on the server. It's not executed like a method and it's not considered an anonymous method. In that case, you can't define a local variable as it's not possible to parse the lambda as an expression tree.</p>

So first, what is a lambda and second how might it be implemented?</p>

<p>Thanks to all who posted.  As has been mentioned in the comments, this is a duplicate, but there are so many great answers here I want to preserve them for the community so I'm turning it into a community post.  Here is the link to the other question:</p>

","33708","Mehrdad Afshari","<p>A lambda is an inline description of a function. It has originated from functional programming languages and the number of other languages that support something like it is growing these days. The name comes from a mathematical thing called Lambda calculus which has influenced functional programming languages (such as Lisp) and the idea of lambdas come from it.</p>

<p>Your question depends on the programming language you're talking about. For instance, in F#, you would use <code>fun x -&gt; x * x</code> to represent </p>

<pre><code>int myfunction(int x) { return x * x; }
</code></pre>

<p>In C#, you would use <code>x =&gt; x * x</code> to represent the same function.
How it's used and what you can do with it pretty much depends on the language you are working in.</p>

<p>Talking about C#, the great thing about them is the ability to parse them as <i>expression trees</i>. A lambda expression can be used as a code, like a <b>delegate</b> (roughly a function pointer) or as data, in an expression tree. Using them as expression trees, make libraries such as LINQ to SQL to be able to use the expression to create a SQL statement in order to submit to server and get the appropriate results.</p>

"<p>As usual, when my brain's messing with something I can't figure out myself, I come to you guys for help :)</p>

<p>This time I've been wondering why stdafx.h works the way it does? To my understanding it does 2 things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Includes standard headers which we

<li>Work as a compiler-bookmark for when

</ul>

<p>Now, these 2 things seems like two very different tasks to me, and I wonder why they didn't do two seperate steps to take care of them? To me it seems reasonable to have a #pragma-command do the bookmarking stuff and to optionally have a header-file a long the lines of windows.h to do the including of often-used headers... Which brings me to my next point: Why are we forced to include often-used headers through stdafx.h? Personally, I'm not aware of any often used headers I use that I'm not already doing my own includes for - but maybe these headers are necessary for .dll generation?</p>

"<p>I understand that boxing and unboxing is about casting (real type to object... object to real type). But I do not understand what the MSDN say about it with the Nullable. Here is the text I do not understand:</p>

  <p>When a nullable type is boxed, the common language runtime automatically boxes the underlying value of the Nullable object, not the Nullable object itself. That is, if the HasValue property is true, the contents of the Value property is boxed.

<p>Where am i going wrong?</p>
","33708","Mehrdad Afshari","<p><code>sizeof</code> operator statically evaluates to the size of the thing you are passing to it. A <code>char*</code> is a pointer which, depending on the machine architecture has a specific size (4 bytes on 32 bit systems and 8 bytes on 64 bit machines). To accomplish what you are trying to do, I suggest you use the <code>string</code> type which you can use by adding <code>#include &lt;string&gt;</code> along with <code>using namespace std;</code> to your source file.</p>

<pre><code>string line;
cin &gt;&gt; line;
cout &lt;&lt; line.length() &lt;&lt; endl;
</code></pre>

<p>It's less error prone and easier to use.</p>

<p>By the way, the thing you've tried to do is really dangerous. In fact, when you use <code>cin &gt;&gt; myArray</code>, you should have already allocated some memory for <code>myArray</code> which you haven't done. This will cause memory corruption which might crash your program and possibly put it to buffer overrun attacks.</p>

<p>A simple array in C++ has no idea about its size. You can use <code>sizeof</code> <b>only if the array is statically allocated</b> and you are using <code>sizeof</code> on the array itself, not another pointer to it, for example this won't work as you might expect:</p>

<pre><code>int x[5];
int *a = &amp;x[0];
// a[i] is now the same as x[i] but:
cout &lt;&lt; sizeof(x) &lt;&lt; endl; // prints 20, assuming int is 32 bits long
cout &lt;&lt; sizeof(a) &lt;&lt; endl; // prints 4, assuming a pointer is 32 bits long
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the total size of the array is printed on the first line, not the element count. You can use <code>sizeof(x)/sizeof(*x)</code> to find out element count in static arrays. This thing is not possible for dynamically allocated arrays using <code>new</code>. In fact C++ arrays are very error prone and you should take extreme care when working with them and you'd better use <code>vector</code> and <code>string</code> in most cases instead.</p>

","33708","Mehrdad Afshari","<p>The first code is better as it restricts scope of <code>o</code> variable to the <code>for</code> block. From a performance perspective, it might not have any effects in Java, but it might have in lower level compilers. They might put the variable in a register if you do the first.</p>

<p>In fact, some people might think that if the compiler is dumb, the second snippet is better in terms of performance. This is what some instructor told me at the college and I laughed at him for this suggestion! Basically, compilers allocate memory on the stack for the local variables of a method just once at the start of the method (by adjusting the stack pointer) and release it at the end of method (again by adjusting the stack pointer, assuming it's not C++ or it doesn't have any destructors to be called). So all stack-based local variables in a method are allocated at once, no matter where they are declared and how much memory they require. Actually, if the compiler is dumb, there is no difference in terms of performance, but if it's smart enough, the first code can actually be better as it'll help the compiler understand the scope and the lifetime of the variable! By the way, if it's really smart, there should no absolutely no difference in performance as it infers the actual scope.</p>

<p>Alright, for the moment I have good answers but mostly very
general. I would like more explanations of the value of the
code. An example is <code>unescape(""%u0a0a%u0a0a"");</code>. What does it mean?
Same thing for the loop, why did the developer write:
<code>length &lt; 0xd0000</code>? I would like a deeper understanding, not
only the theory of this code.</p>
","33708","Mehrdad Afshari","<p>The shellcode contains some x86 assembly instructions that will do the actual exploit. <code>spray</code> creates a long sequence of instructions that will be put in <code>memory</code>. Since we can't usually find out the exact location of our shellcode in memory, we put a lot of <code>nop</code> instructions before it and jump to somewhere there. The <code>memory</code> array will hold the actual x86 code along with the jumping mechanism. We'll feed the crafted XML to the library which has a bug. When it's being parsed, the bug will cause the instruction pointer register to be assigned to somewhere in our exploit, leading to arbitrary code execution.</p>

<p>To understand more deeply, you should actually figure out what is in the x86 code. <code>unscape</code> will be used to put the sequence of bytes represented of the string in the <code>spray</code> variable. It's valid x86 code that fills a large chunk of the heap and jumps to the start of shellcode. The reason for the ending condition is string length limitations of the scripting engine. You can't have strings larger than a specific length.</p>

<p>In x86 assembly, <code>0a0a</code> represents <code>or cl, [edx]</code>. This is effectively equivalent to <code>nop</code> instruction for the purposes of our exploit. Wherever we jump to in the <code>spray</code>, we'll get to the next instruction until we reach the shellcode which is the code we actually want to execute.</p>

<p>If you look at the XML, you'll see <code>0x0a0a</code> is there too. Exactly describing what happens requires specific knowledge of the exploit (you have to know where the bug is and how it's exploited, which I don't know). However, it seems that we force Internet Explorer to trigger the buggy code by setting the <code>innerHtml</code> to that malicious XML string. Internet Explorer tries to parse it and the buggy code somehow gives control to a location of memory where the array exists (since it's a large chunk, the probability of jumping there is high). When we jump there the CPU will keep executing <code>or cl, [edx]</code> instructions until in reaches the beginning of shellcode that's put in memory.</p>

","33708","Mehrdad Afshari","<p>STL is a heavily optimized library. In fact, it's even suggested to use STL in games where high performance might be needed. Arrays are too error prone to be used in day to day tasks. Today's compilers are also very smart and can really produce excellent code with STL. If you know what you are doing, STL can usually provide the necessary performance. For example by initializing vectors to required size (if you know from start), you can basically achieve the array performance. However, there might be cases where you still need arrays. When interfacing with low level code (i.e. assembly) or old libraries that require arrays, you might not be able to use vectors. </p>

"<p>I'm looking into writing a simple synchronization ability into my app and one of the concerns that has popped up is synchronization of time between two remote computers, each with their own clock (in particular concerning the modification dates of files/objects).</p>

<p>I'm sure a lot of research has been done on this topic and don't want to get too theoretical, but I'm wondering if there are any accepted best practices for minimizing temporal discrepancies between remote clocks?</p>

<p>For example, a start is to always use universal time (UTC) as that avoids timezone problems, but there is no guarantee that two computers will have exactly the same system time. Luckily the work I'm doing isn't very fine-grained, so it's not a terribly important concern, but I'm still curious nonetheless.</p>

<p>One solution would be to always use the same clock on both ends, such as a global time server, rather than the local system clock. Presumably this (combined with shared resource locks) could guarantee no accidental overlap of synchronized time, but it's not very practical.</p>

<p>One thought that just popped into my head would be to synchronize each node (each client) with an offset calculated at some point prior, perhaps by calculating the offset of the system clock with a global time server. This would only need to be done occasionally as the offset itself would not likely change greatly over a short period of time.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Let me just add that I'm not interested in actually synchronizing the system clocks of two computers--I'll presume that the operating system will handle this in most cases. This is just a question of how to ensure two instances of an application are using synchronized times, though in this day and age I suppose the system clocks would almost assuredly be synchronized to within some very small delta anyway.</p>

"<p>Is there a way in Cocoa that is currently considered best practice for creating a multi-tier or client server application?</p>

<p>I'm an experienced web developer and I really love Python. I'm new to Cocoa though. The application I'm toying with writing is a patient management system for a large hospital. The system is expected to store huge amounts of data over time but the data transferred during a single session is very light (mostly just text). The communication is assumed to occur over a local network (wired or wireless). It has to be highly secure, of course.</p>

<p>The best I could come up with is to write a Python REST web service and connect to it through the Cocoa app. Maybe I'll even use Python to code the Cocoa app itself.</p>

<p>Looking at Cocoa, I see really great technologies in Cocoa like CoreData but I couldn't find anything similar for client server development. I just want to make sure that I'm not missing anything.</p>

<p>What do you think?</p>

<p>Real world examples will be greatly appreciated.</p>

"<p>I'm trying to write a program that uses sockets to connect with other instances of itself over the network. Since eventually I'd like to write a Windows version as well, I'm currently using BSD sockets on the OS X side so that I can ensure that it will be compatible with the (eventual) Windows version.</p>

<p>The only way that I've been able to get this to work so far is if I specify my actual IP address when creating the server socket. If I use 127.0.0.1 instead, then I can only connect from my local machine.</p>

<p>While this is fine in theory, the question them becomes how do I know which IP address to use? I'm not sure how to get an IP address for the current machine via Cocoa, and even if I can, what if there are multiple valid IP address (such as both an Airport and ethernet connections, for example). How do I know which one to use? I could ask the user, but that doesn't seem like something they could/should know.</p>

","33708","Mehrdad Afshari","<p>I believe it depends on the nature of the stored procedure. Basically, you should handle errors if you have something to do with them (or to encapsulate them for the clients of the procedure) and leave them propagating if you don't have anything to do with them and can't make it friendlier for other layers of the application. </p>

<p>If the stored procedure is designed to insert raw data, I think it should leave the application to handle the possible errors. If the stored procedure is designed as a layer of abstraction (and does a specific <i>task</i> as opposed to running a specific <i>statement</i>) and can either handle the error and do something with it or can report it in a graceful manner (for example, well defined error codes) to the application, it should do so. Otherwise, it should be up to the application to make sure it's not inserting duplicate data, not the database (the database has already enforced this with primary keys).</p>

<li>Is it acceptable to use HttpContext.Current while attempting to write code that will work for both?

You are writing your code for <b>ASP.NET</b>, not ASP.NET MVC or ASP.NET Web Forms. It's easy to make it working on both models (works OOTB with Web forms, with IgnoreRoute in MVC).

"<p>If I have, say, 100 items that'll be stored in a dictionary, should I initialise it thus?</p>

<pre><code>var myDictionary = new Dictionary&lt;Key, Value&gt;(100);

<p>My understanding is that the .NET dictionary internally resizes itself when it reaches a given loading, and that the loading threshold is defined as a ratio of the capacity.</p>

<p>That would suggest that if 100 items were added to the above dictionary, then it would resize itself when one of the items was added.  Resizing a dictionary is something I'd like to avoid as it has a performance hit and is wasteful of memory.</p>

<p>The probability of hashing collisions is proportional to the loading in a dictionary.  Therefore, even if the dictionary does not resize itself (and uses all of its slots) then the performance must degrade due to these collisions. </p>

<p>How should one best decide what capacity to initialise the dictionary to, assuming you know how many items will be inside the dictionary?</p>
","33708","Mehrdad Afshari","<p>Yes, contrary to a <code>HashTable</code> which uses rehashing as the method to resolve collisions, <code>Dictionary</code> will use chaining.

"<p>I know this has something to do with parameter sniffing, but I'm just perplexed at how something like the following example is even possible with a piece of technology that does so many complex things well.</p>

<p>Many of us have run into stored procedures that intermittently run several of orders of magnitude slower than usual, and then if you copy out the sql from the procedure and use the same parameter values in a separate query window, it runs as fast as usual.</p>

<p>I just fixed a procedure like that by converting this:</p>

<pre><code>alter procedure p_MyProc
(
    @param1 int
) as -- do a complex query with @param1
</code></pre>

<p>to this:</p>

<pre><code>alter procedure p_MyProc
(
    @param1 int
)
as

declare @param1Copy int;
set @param1Copy = @param1;

-- Do the query using @param1Copy
</code></pre>

<p>It went from running in over a minute back down to under one second, like it usually runs.  This behavior seems totally random.  For 9 out of 10 @param1 inputs, the query is fast, regardless of how much data it ends up needing to crunch, or how big the result set it.  But for that 1 out of 10, it just gets lost.  And the fix is to replace an int with the same int in the query?</p>

<p>It makes no sense.</p>

<p>More specifically, I am architecting an application that uses multiple System.Threading.Timers to launch processes asynchronously, check queues containing the results of those asynchronous processes, and update the statistics to be shown by the application's main form.</p>

<p>In an application like that, is it appropriate to use a Forms.Timer to actually check the application statistics and draw them to the main form or would that just throw a wrench into the application's smooth running?</p>
","33708","Mehrdad Afshari","<p><code>Forms.Timer</code> registers the timer to send a message when the timer goes off. The event raised is treated like a GUI event. <code>System.Threading.Timer</code> uses a thread blocking approach. Basically, you should use <code>Forms.Timer</code> for your GUI oriented timers (to add some effects to the user interface) and <code>Threading.Timer</code> for scheduling tasks and other things.</p>

I've already browse the web about differences between 2005 and 2008. My question is more specific : Are YOU using 2008? are YOU experiencing problems (such as the FTS mentionned below?)</p>
","33708","Mehrdad Afshari","<p>Database systems are one of the areas that considering the change is costly.

"<p>Since there is a large pool of passionate developers in this community, I would like to gather your opinions on this matter - do you think it is excessive, or advantageous, to purchase and operate actual server hardware at home to spice your own development and learning efforts?</p>

<p>Back in 2003/4 when I jumped into the development line, I felt servers only belonged to the data centre, and did not believe in the pricing of servers for home use; consumer computing power was already pretty solid (back then), and similarly-speced PCs could be had for a fraction of the cost. Having assembled my own PCs since i was a school kid, I viewed the activity of obtaining second-hand components to build a new PC as an easy task. It was straightforward to prepare a PC that would act as a dedicated Windows 2003 server for my development tests. But for over three years now, I have been <a href=""http://icelava.net/mycomputers.aspx"">operating on real servers</a>, albeit low-end models. I ended up in this state due to a number of factors.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Stability</strong>. Server hardware built to work properly together. Tested to run server operating systems. Hardware that I assemble together may or may not work due to all those funny instances of unexpected incompatibilities. And unfortunately I ran into those situations more often than I should, like having to figure out why the PC won't boot up because I have the RAM modules plugged in a particular order, or by simple use of a particular DVD drive. I have not seen a single BSOD for my servers.</li>
<li><strong>Durability</strong>. I leave my servers running 24x7 and for years have (thankfully) not experienced any failure in server hardware. In contrast my PCs are just cursed with rapid failure rates. Even my vendor-purchased laptops eventually sport funny problems one way or another (especially with power supply units).</li>
<li><strong>Warranty</strong>. I may have warranty for individual PC parts, but the warranty for the computer as a whole is against <em>myself</em>. If something were to fail, I myself was the person to call up for help. And call myself I did several times. With the server however, I call techsupport and get them to replace parts.</li>
<li><strong>Capacity</strong>. Virtualization is truly a wonderful thing. Makes setting up single-purpose machines so much easier to manage. I directly loaded my first server to the max with 4GB RAM and happily ran a variety of virtual machines, simulating the multi-server/workstation environments I needed. Now my new server has capacity for 24GB RAM to afford the bigger scenarios I am looking to experiment with (e.g. AD domains, BizTalk server group, TFS group, etc).</li>
</ol>

<p>All in all, with cranky DIYs I spent more time troubleshooting hardware problems than working on actual development issues. When I threw in the money to purchase real servers there was an instant drop in hardware problems in my life. I would probably have bought a vendor-built workstation too if only I could find a configuration that suited my development needs.</p>

<p>Now, some of my tech friends who are passionate with their work also operate their own servers at home. The thing is, most other folks/colleagues get rather surprised that I would actually spend cash for this category of machines. Some would classify me as insane. Have I truly gone overboard?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE - Clarification on server usage</strong></p>

<p>The base server (Windows Server 2008) serves basic IIS 7/ASP.NET, SQL Server 2008, and Subversion services. But the largest role it plays is <strong>hosting a variety of virtual machines in Hyper-V</strong>. I am not a developer who is merely told to whack out application code against a single database and check it into some version control repository then go home without worrying how the application and implementation works out in a production environment. As a solutions integrator, I have to get an understanding of the client/customer environment and think of the big-picture solution that includes <em>infrastructure and deployment concerns</em>. Software application development, while being my primary role, is but a part of the solution.</p>

<p>I frequently find myself having to experiment and discover if certain suggestions or approaches would work for a given environment, and have had to prepare virtual servers like a forest of domains (controllers), web servers, database servers, BizTalk server groups, Team Foundation server, etc to conduct my analysis and solidify my recommendations. These virtual machines work as my personal POCs. The scenarios I face continue to grow larger, and I definitely do not see how I can get to learn how to handle these situations without a base platform that allows me to virtualise and simulate them.</p>

"<p>I am struggling a bit to figure this one out. </p>

<p>I'm working on an ASP.NET MVC project, using LINQ to SQL for my data layer. The database consists of 10 or so different ""exceptions"" tables, e.g. ""Exceptions.LADM"", ""Exceptions.USB"", ""Exceptions.GPO"". Basically these tables are tracking user+machine information for relaxation of various security procedures.</p>

<p>My LINQ to SQL model has been generated. I have different classes for each table available to me. However, I am not sure how to use them in controller without having to generate separate Controller Actions for each exception type. For <code>List</code> action, I want to do something like this:  </p>

<pre><code>// Example Request:  /Exceptions/List/ladm
// Routing:   Controller = ""Exceptions"", Action = ""List"", type = ""ladm""

// Controller Action:

public ActionResult List(string type)
{
    string viewname = ""List-"" + type;   // refer to ""List-ladm"" view.
    if(type == ""ladm"")
    {
       var items = _repository.ListAllLADMExceptions();
    }

    return View(viewname, items);
}

"<p>update:  I know there is no one best way to do everything.  Sorry for not saying that right off.  In the context of the data-access tutorials, if you had to do the project he did in that tutorial, would you do what he did or would use use MVC, if you had to choose one of them?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Is MVC the more appropriate way to program asp.net applications, instead of the tutorials found here:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.asp.net/Learn/data-access/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.asp.net/Learn/data-access/</a></p>

<p><strong>Original:</strong></p>

<p>I ask, because I initially learned about MVC with Java applications, then things like RoR, and Django.  These other projects and companies spoke as if MVC had been around for a very long time, and from what I found out it had.  Then Microsoft started putting MVC into the .net framework.</p>

<p>I ask because I don't know how to design things very well and thought I was doing well to emulate what's on the asp.net site with Scott Mitchell's tutorial.  I thought that creating abstract layers in a BLL was the way to go until I found out about MVC and now asp.net's MVC.</p>

<p>I honestly don't know what the ""right"" way is to do things.  I just create what I need, but I can't help feel like I am missing something.</p>

<p>Is MVC the correct way to start doing things in large projects, specifically I mean MVC and ASP.NET, but could just as well mean PHP and one of their MVC frameworks.</p>

<p>I'd like to settle on a standard way of doing things...for now anyway.</p>

<p>And, out of curiosity, why did Microsoft only now start doing MVC?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Is MVC better than the current tutorial set on asp.net?</p>

<p>I'm referring to the Scott Mitchell tutorials where he creates the BLL for abstraction.  Or is that a linq question as well.  I should have said that I understand the need for keeping logic and presentation separate but unsure the best way to do it.  I was using the asp.net tutorials.  It worked fine.  Then I found out the rest of the world, as I saw it anyway, was using MVC.  Then Microsoft started developing MVC, so to me the other method seems obsolete and the wrong way to do things.</p>
","33708","Mehrdad Afshari","<p>No, it's not the only best way to do things.</p>

<p>MVC is just a design pattern. The goal of all design patterns is simplicity. So as long as it makes your design simpler, go with it. If it makes things more complex for your specific application, try a different approach.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, some people think if they see a pattern, they should use it. It's just not true. Design patterns don't inherently make your application better. They are not an end. They are a means to an end (which is simplicity). So you should use them only if they are worth it.</p>

<p>In my opinion, over-architecting things without a good reason is worse than writing code without any specific design.</p>

<p><b>EDIT:</b> Regarding ASP.NET MVC: I have a negative personal bias toward ASP.NET Web forms. Before MVC, I did most of the dynamic aspects of advanced projects by writing custom handlers to have fine grained control over the HTML. Web Forms make Web development very easy but they have particularly a couple things that are good but sometimes are problematic. The first of which is <code>ViewState</code> and the second is complex <code>WebControl</code> architecture. Don't get me wrong. Those are signs of brilliance of ASP.NET. I haven't seen a single platform for Web development as easy as ASP.NET Web Forms and this is only because of great <code>WebControl</code> support which requires <code>ViewState</code>. However, in some projects, you want to have precise control on rendered HTML (specially when you have some client-side logic). You also want to make server side code maintainable in large projects. In those areas, ASP.NET MVC really shines. But I think ASP.NET Web Forms will remain a great technology where it's more applicable. After all, as I said regarding design patterns in general, you should carefully evaluate your design to see which one better fits your needs.</p>

<p>Specifically, about data access, MVC usually requires more code than Web Forms counterparts. For presenting tabular data (i.e where GridView is applicable), I think ASP.NET Web Forms is the easier way to accomplish things. However, most data driven Web apps are not just manipulating a table directly in a database. They have complex layout. StackOverflow is a great example of this. It is certainly data driven, but ASP.NET MVC better suits it.</p>

"<p>I'm writing a simplistic game to learn get some more C++ experience, and I have an idea where I feel polymorphism <em>almost</em> works, but doesn't. In this game, the <code>Party</code> moves fairly linearly through a <code>Map</code>, but can occasionally encounter a <code>Fork</code> in the road. A fork is (basically) an <code>std::vector&lt;location*&gt;</code>.Originally I was going to code something like the following into the a <code>Party</code> member function:</p>

<pre><code>if(!CurrLocation-&gt;fork_.empty())
   // Loop through forks and show options to the player, go where s/he wants
else
  (CurrLocation++)
</code></pre>

<p>But I was wondering if some variant of the following might be better:</p>

<pre><code>CurrLocation = CurrLocation-&gt;getNext();
</code></pre>

<p>With Fork actually being derived from Location, and overloading some new function <code>getNext()</code>. But in the latter case, the <code>location</code> (a low level structure) would have to be the one to present the message to the user instead of ""passing this back up"", which I don't feel is elegant as it couples <code>location</code> to <code>UserInterface::*</code>.</p>

"<p>I distinctly remember that, at one time, the guideline pushed by Microsoft was to add the ""Base"" suffix to an abstract class to obviate the fact that it was abstract.

<p>But I've noticed that, of late, a lot of abstract classes in the Framework don't seem to be following this convention. For example, the following classes are all abstract but don't follow this convention:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectory.DirectoryServer</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>System.Configuration.ConfigurationElement</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>System.Drawing.Brush</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>System.Windows.Forms.CommonDialog</code></p></li>

I found the <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms229040.aspx"">Names of Classes, Structs, and Interfaces</a> on MSDN at <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms229042.aspx"">Design Guidelines for Developing Class Libraries</a>.

"<p>I'm trying to build a very, very simple ""micro-webapp"" which I suspect will be of interest to a few Stack Overflow'rs if I ever get it done. I'm hosting it on my C# in Depth site, which is vanilla ASP.NET 3.5 (i.e. not MVC).</p>

<p>The flow is very simple:</p>

<ul>
<li>If a user enters the app with a URL which doesn't specify all the parameters (or if any of them are invalid) I want to just display the user input controls. (There are only two.)</li>
<li>If a user enters the app with a URL which <em>does</em> have all the required parameters, I want to display the results <em>and</em> the input controls (so they can change the parameters)</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are my self-imposed requirements (mixture of design and implementation):</p>

<ul>
<li>I want the submission to use GET rather than POST, mostly so users can bookmark the page easily.</li>
<li>I <em>don't</em> want the URL to end up looking silly after submission, with extraneous bits and pieces on it. Just the main URL and the real parameters please.</li>
<li>Ideally I'd like to avoid requiring JavaScript at all. There's no good reason for it in this app.</li>
<li>I want to be able to access the controls during render time and set values etc. In particular, I want to be able to set the default values of the controls to the parameter values passed in, if ASP.NET can't do this automatically for me (within the other restrictions).</li>
<li>I'm happy to do all the parameter validation myself, and I don't need much in the way of server side events. It's really simple to set everything on page load instead of attaching events to buttons etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Most of this is okay, but I haven't found any way of <em>completely</em> removing the viewstate and keeping the rest of the useful functionality. Using the post from <a href=""http://aspnyc.blogspot.com/2007/10/how-to-completely-disable-viewstate.html"">this blog post</a> I've managed to avoid getting any actual <em>value</em> for the viewstate - but it still ends up as a parameter on the URL, which looks really ugly.</p>

<p>If I make it a plain HTML form instead of an ASP.NET form (i.e. take out <code>runat=""server""</code>) then I don't get any magic viewstate - but then I can't access the controls programmatically.</p>

<p>I <em>could</em> do all of this by ignoring most of ASP.NET and building up an XML document with LINQ to XML, and implementing <code>IHttpHandler</code>. That feels a bit low level though.</p>

<p>I realise that my problems could be solved by either relaxing my constraints (e.g. using POST and not caring about the surplus parameter) or by using ASP.NET MVC, but are my requirements really unreasonable?</p>

<p>Maybe ASP.NET just doesn't scale <em>down</em> to this sort of app? There's a very likely alternative though: I'm just being stupid, and there's a perfectly simple way of doing it that I just haven't found.</p>

<p>Any thoughts, anyone? (Cue comments of how the mighty are fallen, etc. That's fine - I hope I've never claimed to be an ASP.NET expert, as the truth is quite the opposite...)</p>

<p>It seems that there are already a lot of questions on the subject that I couldn't find (there are no results if you actually search for anything with the term 'F#'). One good point <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/142985/is-a-program-f-any-more-efficient-execution-wise-than-c"">here</a> was the following answer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>F# provides some performance-related
  features that can make a difference.</p>
  
  <p>Firstly, the implementation of
  delegates on .NET is currently quite
  inefficient and, consequently, F# uses
  its own FastFunc type for
  high-performance first-class
  functions.</p>
  
  <p>Secondly, F# uses .NET metadata to
  convey inline functions so that they
  can be exported across APIs and, of
  course, that can dramatically improve
  performance in certain circumstances.</p>
  
  <p>Finally, pattern matching can be
  extremely laborious to express in C#
  because the language lacks pattern
  matching but it is almost impossible
  to maintain optimized C# code
  equivalent to many non-trivial pattern
  matches. In contrast, the F# compiler
  aggressively optimizes pattern matches
  during compilation.</p>
  
  <p>Conversely, the C# compiler is better
  at optimizing loops using IEnumerables
  and is better at optimizing
  computations over value types (e.g.
  complex arithmetic).</p>

","33708","Mehrdad Afshari","<p>In fact, in theory, an x86 machine can only execute x86 assembly which is of an imperative nature, therefore, theoretically it's possible to achieve the performance of a functional language imperatively. So you can write C# programs that are equal or better than their F# counterparts. The keyword here is <b>can</b>. It doesn't mean all C# programs are better than F# programs or anything like that. Generally, F# performance is very acceptable in most problems. There are some cases where F# performance lags too much behind C#, but generally, it's OK for most applications. However, if you want to have fine-grained control on what your code actually does, functional languages are not for you. You have more optimization opportunity in C# than you have in F#. By the way, by F#, I don't mean writing imperative code, but normal functional approach (if you want to write code imperatively, I don't think F# makes much sense).</p>

"<p>Here's what I'm trying to do. I'm querying an XML file using LINQ to XML, which gives me an IEnumerable<code>&lt;T</code>> object, where T is my ""Village"" class, filled with the results of this query. Some results are duplicated, so I would like to perform a Distinct() on the IEnumerable object, like so:</p>

<pre><code>public IEnumerable&lt;Village&gt; GetAllAlliances()
{
    try
    {
        IEnumerable&lt;Village&gt; alliances =
             from alliance in xmlDoc.Elements(""Village"")
             where alliance.Element(""AllianceName"").Value != String.Empty
             orderby alliance.Element(""AllianceName"").Value
             select new Village
             {
                 AllianceName = alliance.Element(""AllianceName"").Value
             };

        // TODO: make it work...
        return alliances.Distinct(new AllianceComparer());
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        throw new Exception(""GetAllAlliances"", ex);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>As the default comparer would not work for the Village object, I implemented a custom one, as seen here in the AllianceComparer class:</p>

<pre><code>public class AllianceComparer : IEqualityComparer&lt;Village&gt;
{
    #region IEqualityComparer&lt;Village&gt; Members
    bool IEqualityComparer&lt;Village&gt;.Equals(Village x, Village y)
    {
        // Check whether the compared objects reference the same data.
        if (Object.ReferenceEquals(x, y)) 
            return true;

        // Check whether any of the compared objects is null.
        if (Object.ReferenceEquals(x, null) || Object.ReferenceEquals(y, null))
            return false;

        return x.AllianceName == y.AllianceName;
    }

    int IEqualityComparer&lt;Village&gt;.GetHashCode(Village obj)
    {
        return obj.GetHashCode();
    }
    #endregion
}
</code></pre>

<p>The Distinct() method doesn't work, as I have exactly the same number of results with or without it. Another thing, and I don't know if it's usually possible, but I cannot step into AllianceComparer.Equals() to see what could be the problem.<br/>
I've found examples of this on the Internet, but I can't seem to make my implementation work.</p>

<p>Hopefully, someone here might see what could be wrong here!
Thanks in advance!</p>
","33708","Mehrdad Afshari","<p>The problem is with your <code>GetHashCode</code>. You should alter it to return the hash code of <code>AllianceName</code> instead.</p>

<pre><code>int IEqualityComparer&lt;Village&gt;.GetHashCode(Village obj)
{
    return obj.AllianceName.GetHashCode();
}
</code></pre>

<p>The thing is, if <code>Equals</code> returns <code>true</code>, the objects should have the same hash code which is not the case for different <code>Village</code> objects with same <code>AllianceName</code>. Since <code>Distinct</code> works by building a hash table internally, you'll end up with equal objects that won't be matched at all due to different hash codes. </p>

<p>Similarly, to compare two files, if the hash of two files are not the same, you don't need to check the files themselves at all. They <b>will</b> be different. Otherwise, you'll continue to check to see if they are really the same or not. That's exactly what the hash table that <code>Distinct</code> uses behaves.</p>

"<p>This has always bugged me. Perhaps someone with some hardcore knowledge of .NET internals can explain it to me.</p>

<p>Suppose I define an enum as follows:</p>

<pre><code>public enum Foo
{
   Eenie = 1,
   Meenie = 2,
   Miney = 3,
   Moe = 4
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, also suppose that somewhere in my code, I have the following code:</p>

<pre><code>int bar = (Foo)5;
</code></pre>

<p>This will compile just fine, and no exception will be raised whatsoever, even though the value 5 is clearly not a valid value defined in <code>Foo</code>.</p>

<p>Or, consider the following:</p>

<pre><code>public void ProcessFoo(Foo theFoo)
{
    // Do processing
}

public static void Main()
{
    ProcessFoo((Foo)5);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Again, no exception.</p>

<p>In my mind, this should result in a type mismatch exception, because 5 is not a <code>Foo</code>. But the designers chose not to do that. </p>

<p>Now, I've written an extension method that can verify that this is the case, and it's no big deal to invoke it to ensure that that's the case, but I have to use reflection to do it (with all its performance penalties and whatnot).</p>

<p>So again, what compelling reason is there that could possibly have driven the decision to not have a checked enum? </p>

<p>For reference, from <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.enum.aspx"">the MSDN documentation for the Enum class</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When you define a method or property
  that takes an enumerated constant as a
  value, consider validating the value.
  The reason is that you can cast a
  numeric value to the enumeration type
  even if that numeric value is not
  defined in the enumeration.</p>

<p>Thanks for Your answers.
Now I see that i cannot convert from a base class to derived class and i see that it doesn't have anything to do with generics.
But why i cannot create user-defined conversions from a base class? I have a method that returns the base class. I am able to define a conversion method but creating a cast operator imho would be a better solution.</p>
","33708","Mehrdad Afshari","<p>You can only cast from a base class to a derived class if the object is actually of type derived class. I mean, you can't cast an instance of base (<code>MyClass&lt;int&gt;</code>) to <code>MyIntClass</code>. You can, however cast it if it was actually of type <code>MyIntClass</code> stored as an <code>MyClass&lt;int&gt;</code> instance.</p>

<pre><code>MyClass&lt;int&gt; foo = new MyIntClass();
MyIntClass bar = (MyIntClass)foo; // this works.

<p>Assume:</p>

<pre><code>class Base {
   int x;
}

class Derived : Base {
   int y;
}

Base foo = new Base();
Derived bar = (Derived)foo;
</code></pre>

<p>if it was allowed, what would the value of <code>bar.y</code> be? 
In fact, converting from <code>Derived</code> to <code>Base</code> is not a conversion at all. It's just telling the compiler to let the variable of type <code>Base</code> to point to an object of type <code>Derived</code>. It is possible since derived has more or equal features than <code>Base</code> which is not the case in the other way around.</p>

<p>If you were able to create a conversion operator between base and derived classes, the C# compiler would be unable to distinguish it from the built in relationships defined for them. This is why you cannot create cast operators along inheritance hierarchies.</p>

","33708","Mehrdad Afshari","<p>No, it's not possible with a neat syntax. The reason is, internally, the runtime treats the method as a simple method taking an array argument. The compiler does the housekeeping of creating an array and filling it with the arguments specified.

Other ways to accomplish it will defeat the purpose of existence of <code>params</code> which is a nice syntax for variable number of arguments.</p>

To do this we need to prompt the user for a username/password combination, this value can be used for all servers without issue.</p>

<p>The question is where is the most secure location to store this information?  We need to store it temporarily as when they are on this specific page they could be executing hundreds of scripts, over multiple postbacks.

What is the most secure, while still being friendly for the user?</p>

<p><strong>Store Information In Viewstate</strong></p>

<p>One of the first ideas we discussed was storing the information after being supplied by the user in the ViewState for the page.  This is helpful as the information will only exist for the lifetime of the page, however, we are unsure of the security implications.</p>

<p><strong>Store information in Session</strong></p>

<p>The next idea we had was to store it in session, however, the downside to this is that the information can be made available to other pages inside the application, and the information always lingers in memory on the server.</p>

<p><strong>Store Information in Application</strong></p>

<p>The last idea that we had was to store it in the Application cache, with a user specific key and a sliding 5 minute expiration.  This would still be available to other pages, however, it would ensure that the information is cached for a shorter period.</p>

<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>

<p>The final question that is important is ""Why are you doing this?"".  Why don't we just use their Lan id's?  Well we cannot use lan id's due to the lack of network support for delegation.</p>

<p>S0 what is the recommended solution?  Why?  How secure is it, and can we be?</p>

<p>Great information has been discussed.  TO clarify, we are running in an intranet environment, we CANNOT use Impersonation or Delegation due to limitations in the network.  </p>

<p>Regarding the <code>Session</code> and <code>Application</code> approaches, I don't think <code>Application</code> approach makes sense. Data is user specific, so <code>Session</code> should be the way to go. It'll go away as soon as user's session is closed.

"<p>I've been experimenting with ASP.NET MVC and following <a href=""http://www.asp.net/learn/mvc/tutorial-01-cs.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> tutorial to create the basic task list application. I've gotten it running fine, everything is working although the video is in VB and I had some trouble getting it ""converted"" to C# but muddled through thanks to the codesample.</p>

<p>Now, to further my knowledge I've decided to make a small modification to the system. I want to change the Index page so as to display ""My Tasks"" in red if all tasks are complete, and ""My Tasks"" in green if there are <em>any</em> incomplete tasks.</p>

<p>I've added the following function to HomeController.cs:</p>

<pre><code>    public bool Uncomplete()
    {
        bool AnyLeft = false;
        var tasks = from t in db.Tasks orderby t.EntryDate descending select t;
        foreach (Task match in tasks)
        {
            if (match.IsCompleted == false)
            {
                AnyLeft = true;
            }
        }

        return AnyLeft;
    }

<pre><code>    public ActionResult Index()
    {
        bool AnyLeft = Uncomplete();
        var tasks = from t in db.Tasks orderby t.EntryDate descending select t;
        return View(tasks.ToList());
    }
</code></pre>

<p>With my final intent to use the following code in Index.aspx:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;% if (AnyLeft == false)
   { %&gt;
    &lt;h1 class=""green""&gt;My Tasks&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;% }
   else
   { %&gt;
    &lt;h1 class=""red""&gt;My Tasks&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;% } %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>However, I can't figure out how to make Index.aspx ""aware"" of AnyLeft having a value of true or false. I tried</p>

<pre><code>return View(tasks.ToList(), AnyLeft);
</code></pre>

<p>But that throws errors that I can't quite decipher. I have a feeling I'm going about things ""the wrong way"" but I can't figure it out.</p>

In the emitted IL, there is no such thing as casting an <code>object</code> to a <code>string</code>, for instance.

<p><code>Integer.Parse</code> and <code>CInt</code> basically do some process on the source object (the string) and convert it to an equivalent integer. They do something. <code>CType</code> just instructs the language compiler about the type conversion.</p>

<p>For the sake of completeness, the IL equivalent of casting is:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>castclass</code> if the type is a reference type.</li>
<li><code>unbox</code> if the type is a value type.</li>

<p>I'm not sure whether it is the same with threads inside a process: If one hangs, are the others unaffected?

<p>But there are 100 classes and i don't feel like going though them all and looking for the ones that i can apply IAnimal to.</p>

<p>What i want to do is this:</p>

<pre><code>dog scruffy = new dog();
cat ruffles = new cat();

IAnimal[] animals = new IAnimal[] {scruffy as IAnimal, ruffles as IAnimal} // gives null
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>IAnimal[] animals = new IAnimal[] {(IAnimal)scruffy, (IAnimal)ruffles} //throws exception
</code></pre>

<p>then do</p>

<pre><code>foreach (IAnimal animal in animals)
{
   animal.eat();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Is there a way to make c# let me treat ruffles and scruffy as an IAnimal without having to write : IAnimal when writing the class.</p>

My question is, how difficult the API for CUDA and other GP-GPU technologies to use in practice?  Is it extremely painful, or is most of the complexity well-encapsulated?

<h2>Explanation</h2>

<p><code>(1 &lt;&lt; i)</code> shifts the value <code>1</code>, <code>i</code> bits to the left.
The <code>&amp;</code> operator computes the <i>bitwise and</i> of the operands. </p>

<p>The <code>for</code> loop runs once for each of the 32 bits in the float. Each time, <code>i</code> will be the number of the bit we want to extract the value from. We compute the bitwise and of the number and <code>1 &lt;&lt; i</code>:</p>

<p>Assume the number is: 1001011, and <code>i = 2</code></p>

<p><code>1&lt;&lt;i</code> will be equal to 0000100</p>

<pre><code>  10001011

<pre><code>  10001011
&amp; 00001000
==========
  00001000

<p>Basically, the result will be a number with <code>i</code>th bit set to the <code>i</code>th bit of the original number and all other bits are zero. The result will be either zero, which means the <code>i</code>th bit in the original number was zero or nonzero, which means the actual number had the <code>i</code>th bit equal to <code>1</code>.</p>

"<p>Sometimes the overhead of creating a new model type is annoying. In these cases, I want to set ViewData, and the options seem to be:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Simply set viewdata with a string key, and cast it out. This has obvious problems.</p></li>
<li><p>Store the identifier (string key) somewhere (where? on the controller?) and cast it out on the viewpage. While solving one of the problems, I'm still casting, which is problematic, and kills type inference.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the MVCContrib strongly typed Set/Get functions. These are nice sometimes, but if the type isn't very descriptive, say a boolean ""IsNew"", they don't work too well. It also kills type inference and it's still pretty much just doing a cast, so I must manually sync up the view and controller.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So, instead I'm thinking of using a phantom type to combine both the type and key identifier. It'd be equivalent to this psuedo-C#:</p>

<pre><code>class ViewDataKey&lt;T&gt; = string
</code></pre>

<p>This would let me create identifiers in the controller like this:</p>

<pre><code>public static readonly ViewDataKey&lt;bool&gt; IsNew = ""IsNew"";
</code></pre>

<p>With some simple extension methods, setting the data would be:</p>

<pre><code>  ViewData.Set(IsNew, true);

<p>Getting it out is just as easy:</p>

<pre><code>var isNew = ViewData.Get(FrobNozzleController.IsNew);

<p>Notice we don't need to specify the type of isNew, it's safely inferred. The key and type definitons are stored in one location.</p>

<li><p>Where should the key be stored? For ""global-ish"" ViewData, some common class works fine. But for View/Controller specific data? Is there any downside to putting it on the controller? (Apart from the long name of the controller?)</p></li>

<p>I have run into the problem many times, but always have to play around and somehow the event handler magically works again.  Below is an example where this happened to me again today.  Do you know a quick way to fix this type of problem?</p>

<pre><code>&lt;asp:LinkButton ID=""LinkButton1"" runat=""server"" OnClick=""LinkButton1_Click""&gt;
    Link
&lt;/asp:LinkButton&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I set a breakpoint on this method and it never gets hit.</p>

<pre><code>protected void LinkButton1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    // snip
}

<p>I have tried cleaning the solution, rebuilding all, etc.  Any insight here?</p>

<p>Yes, AutoEventWireup is set to true.  No other system/development environment changes were made.  I'm using .NET 3.5.</p>

"<p>Is there a way to reserve or skip or increment value of identity column? </p>

<p>I Have two tables joined in one-to-one relation ship. First one has IDENTITY PK column, and second one int PK (not IDENTITY). I used to insert in first, get ID and insert in second. And it works ok.</p>

<p>Now I need to insert values in second table without inserting into first. </p>

<p>Now, how to increment IDENTITY seed, so I can insert it into second table, but leave ""hole"" in ID's of first table? </p>

<p>This works:   </p>

-- so i will insert foo row, get id, and delete it
INSERT INTO TABLE1 (SomeRequiredField) VALUES ('foo');

-- Then I can insert in TABLE2

"<p>I have some neural net code written in c# that would benefit from using <a href=""http://go-mono.com/docs/index.aspx?tlink=0@N%3aMono.Simd"">SIMD</a> support. <a href=""http://www.mono-project.com/news/archive/2009/Jan-13.html"">Mono 2.2</a> just came out that supports SIMD but Microsoft's c# does not support this yet.  Being happy with my c# setup I was wondering if I could write a lib in mono for that piece and call it from .net.</p>

I guess what I really want to know is it possible to compile <a href=""http://www.mono-project.com/Main%5FPage"">mono</a> down to something like a DLL that I then can call from dotnet.

<p>I heard Miguel de Icaza on another pod cast <a href=""http://herdingcode.com/?p=109"">Herding Code Episode 28</a> say that you could use the mono complier to compile to an exe not just to intermediate code. What are the implications of this? </p>

","33708","Mehrdad Afshari","<p>In order to take advantage of SIMD features, the runtime should be able to natively support it. Basically, Mono treats <code>Mono.Simd</code> namespace specially in the runtime. Obviously, Microsoft .NET runtime does not support this feature. However, the <code>Mono.Simd</code> assembly provided is a completely valid and normal .NET assembly written in managed code and therefore it can run on .NET CLR, but it would be just a software emulation of what SIMD instructions do.</p>

<p>You can run Mono runtime on Windows and take advantage of those features but there is no direct way to run half of application on .NET and the other half on Mono (you could, of course, use communication mechanisms as two distinct applications can use, but it doesn't make sense for this scenario at all).</p>

"<p>Given a <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> in c# is there a way to extend it (within its capacity) and set the new elements to <code>null</code>? I'd like something that works like a <code>memset</code>.

<p>This is for IIS 6.0 / Windows Server 2003. </p>

<p>I'm working with an extremely large ASP/ASP.NET application and I'm trying to get my development environment to match my team members environment. This process is basically trial and error: get an error, go into IIS, make a change, hope the error is fixed. Ugh. I'm hoping to find a way to <strong>replicate a set of IIS directories and their configurations</strong> on one machine onto my machine. </p>

<p>I did find a script that will iterate through and give me a list of all virtual directories on a machine. It helped, but not a lot since I still have to go in and set up all those virtual directories (I think there are like 20 of them ballpark). The whole process is complicated by the fact that we're mixing ASP and ASP.NET applications in the same application which spans many solutions and projects. Getting the whole thing up and going seems like way too much work but I've never heard of a real solution to this. </p>

"<p>I'm writing the <code>RenderContents()</code> method of my ASP.NET server control. The method uses an <code>HtmlTextWriter</code> object to render the output content. For the control I'm writing, using the <code>HtmlTextWriter</code>'s methods seems like it will require a lot of lines of code to open and close every tag and add every attribute to the stream. In the end I feel like I'm going to end up with code that is a lot longer than it needs to be.</p>

<p>I was thinking that if I used a chainable class such as <code>StringBuilder</code>, my code would be a lot cleaner to read and easier to write.</p>

<p>What I was wondering was, is there any reason to use the <code>HtmlTextWriter</code> object to render my entire control's contents? Other than the safety checks (I'm assuming) it includes to make sure you don't write tags in the wrong order or create invalid markup, I don't see a reason.</p>

<p>It seems like it would be easier to just do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>protected override void RenderContents(HtmlTextWriter output)
{
    StringBuilder s = new StringBuilder();
    s.Append(""lots"")
     .Append(""of"")
     .Append(""strings"");

    output.BeginRender();
    output.Write(s.ToString());
    output.EndRender();

In response to <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/489691#489711"">Mehrdad Afshari</a>'s answer:<br />
 I didn't think much about the memory requirements of having a separate <code>StringBuilder</code> object instantiated. What about making a wrapper for HtmlTextWriter so that it can be chained so that an extra string isn't made.</p>

{
    private HtmlTextWriter _W;
    public ChainedHtmlTextWriter(HtmlTextWriter writer)
    {
        _W = writer;

","33708","Mehrdad Afshari","<p>Performance-wise, this will require more string copies to be done. <code>HtmlTextWriter</code> writes directly to the output buffer. <code>StringBuilder</code> on the other hand, has its own buffer.

"<p>I'm writing a <a href=""http://microformats.org"" rel=""nofollow"">microformats</a> parser in C# and am looking for some refactoring advice. This is probably the first ""real"" project I've attempted in C# for some time (I program almost exclusively in VB6 at my day job), so I have the feeling this question may become the first in a series ;-)</p>

<p>Let me provide some background about what I have so far, so that my question will (hopefully) make sense.</p>

<p>Right now, I have a single class, <code>MicroformatsParser</code>, doing all the work. It has an overloaded constructor that lets you pass a <code>System.Uri</code> or a <code>string</code> containing a URI: upon construction, it downloads the HTML document at the given URI and loads it into an <code>HtmlAgilityPack.HtmlDocument</code> for easy manipulation by the class.</p>

<p>The basic API works like this (or will, once I finish the code...):</p>

<pre><code>MicroformatsParser mp = new MicroformatsParser(""http://microformats.org"");
List&lt;HCard&gt; hcards = mp.GetAll&lt;HCard&gt;();

foreach(HCard hcard in hcards) 
{
    Console.WriteLine(""Full Name: {0}"", hcard.FullName);

    foreach(string email in hcard.EmailAddresses)
        Console.WriteLine(""E-Mail Address: {0}"", email);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The use of generics here is intentional. I got my inspiration from the way that the the Microformats library in Firefox 3 works (and the Ruby <code>mofo</code> gem). The idea here is that the parser does the heavy lifting (finding the actual microformat content in the HTML), and the microformat classes themselves (<code>HCard</code> in the above example) basically provide the schema that tells the parser how to handle the data it finds.</p>

<p>The code for the <code>HCard</code> class should make this clearer (note this is a not a complete implementation):</p>

<pre><code>[ContainerName(""vcard"")]
public class HCard
{
    [PropertyName(""fn"")]
    public string FullName;

    [PropertyName(""email"")]
    public List&lt;string&gt; EmailAddresses;

    [PropertyName(""adr"")]
    public List&lt;Address&gt; Addresses;

    public HCard()
    { 
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The attributes here are used by the parser to determine how to populate an instance of the class with data from an HTML document. The parser does the following when you call <code>GetAll&lt;T&gt;()</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Checks that the type <code>T</code> has a <code>ContainerName</code> attribute (and it's not blank)</li>
<li>Searches the HTML document for all nodes with a <code>class</code> attribute that matches the <code>ContainerName</code>. Call these the ""container nodes"".</li>
<li>For each container node:
<ul>
<li>Uses reflection to create an object of type <code>T</code>.</li>
<li>Get the public fields (a <code>MemberInfo[]</code>) for type <code>T</code> via reflection</li>
<li>For each field's <code>MemberInfo</code>
<ul>
<li>If the field has a <code>PropertyName</code> attribute
<ul>
<li>Get the value of the corresponding microformat property from the HTML</li>
<li><strong>Inject the value found in the HTML into the field (i.e. set the value of the field on the object of type <code>T</code> created in the first step)</strong></li>
<li>Add the object of type <code>T</code> to a <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Return the <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code>, which now contains a bunch of microformat objects</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>I'm trying to figure out a better way to implement the step in <strong>bold</strong>. The problem is that the <code>Type</code> of a given field in the microformat class determines not only what node to look for in the HTML, but also how to interpret the data.</p>

<p>For example, going back to the <code>HCard</code> class I defined above, the <code>""email""</code> property is bound to the <code>EmailAddresses</code> field, which is a <code>List&lt;string&gt;</code>. After the parser finds all the <code>""email""</code> child nodes of the parent <code>""vcard""</code> node in the HTML, it has to put them in a <code>List&lt;string&gt;</code>. </p>

<p>What's more, if I want my <code>HCard</code> to be able to return phone number information, I would probably want to be able to declare a new field of type <code>List&lt;HCard.TelephoneNumber&gt;</code> (which would have its own <code>ContainerName(""tel"")</code> attribute) to hold that information, because there can be multiple <code>""tel""</code> elements in the HTML, and the <code>""tel""</code> format has its own sub-properties. But now the parser needs to know how to put the telephone data into a <code>List&lt;HCard.TelephoneNumber&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>The same problem applies to <code>Float</code>S, <code>DateTime</code>S, <code>List&lt;Float&gt;</code>S, <code>List&lt;Integer&gt;</code>S, etc.</p>

<p>The obvious answer is to have the parser switch on the type of field, and do the appropriate conversions for each case, but I want to avoid a giant <code>switch</code> statement. Note that I'm not planning to make the parser support every possible <code>Type</code> in existence, but I will want it to handle most scalar types, and the <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> versions of them, along with the ability to recognize other microformat classes (so that a microformat class can be composed from other microformat classes).</p>

<p>Any advice on how best to handle this? </p>

<p>Since the parser has to handle primitive data types, I don't think I can add polymorphism at the type level... </p>

<p>My first thought was to use method overloading, so I would have a series of a <code>GetPropValue</code> overloads like <code>GetPropValue(HtmlNode node, ref string retrievedValue)</code>, <code>GetPropValue(HtmlNode, ref List&lt;Float&gt; retrievedValue)</code>, etc. but I'm wondering if there is a better approach to this problem.</p>

Im using Session variables a lot and have sometimes problem in a booking-application when users starts to order products and then goes to lunch and come back some hours later and continue the booking. I store the booking in the session until the user confirm or abort the booking so I dont need to talk to the database and handle halfway bookings in the database when users just click the X in the browser and never comes back.</p>

<p>Should I instead use cashe or cookies or any combination of all above for this?</p>

<p>Im mostly doing desktop-programming and feel I lack a lots of knowledge here so anyone who can expand on where to use Cache, Session, cookies (or db) </p>

"<p>For the equivalent mechanism in C++ (the destructor), the advice is that <a href=""http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/exceptions.html#faq-17.3"">it should usually not throw any exceptions</a>. This is mainly because by doing so you might terminate your process, which is only very rarely a good strategy.</p>

<p>In the equivalent scenario in .NET ...</p>

<ol>
<li>A first exception is thrown</li>
<li>A finally block is executed as a result of the first exception</li>
<li>The finally block calls a Dispose() method</li>
<li>The Dispose() method throws a second exception</li>
</ol>

<p>... your process does not terminate immediately. However, you lose information because .NET unceremoneously replaces the first exception with the second one. A catch block somewhere up the call stack will therefore never see the first exception. However, one is usually more interested in the first exception because that normally gives better clues as to why things started to go wrong.</p>

<p>Since .NET lacks a mechanism to detect whether code is being executed while an exception is pending, it seems there are really only two choices how IDisposable can be implemented:</p>

<ul>
<li>Always swallow all exceptions that occur inside Dispose(). Not good as you might also end up swallowing OutOfMemoryException, ExecutionEngineException, etc. which I'd usually rather let tear down the process when they occur without another exception already pending.</li>
<li>Let all exceptions propagate out of Dispose(). Not good as you might lose information about the root cause of a problem, see above.</li>
</ul>

Beside that, I think <code>Dispose</code> should be treated like all other methods: handle if you can do something with it, let it bubble if you can't.</p>

<p>EDIT: For the specified example, I would write the code so that <em>my code</em> does not cause an exception, but clearing the <code>TcpClient</code> up might cause an exception, which <em>should be valid to propagate</em> in my opinion (or to handle and rethrow as a more generic exception, just like any method):</p>

   if (tcpClient != null)
     tcpClient.Close();

<p><em>Side Note</em>: while <code>MAX</code> will use a stream aggregate operator in the execution plan in the indexed case, it doesn't have any specific cost as it's just processing a single row (<code>Actual Rows = 1</code>). You can compare queries by running them in a single batch and see the relative cost. In the indexed case, both queries will cost 50%.

"<p>When working on web apps in ASP.NET, what is the reason for specifying a file as stylesheet.css.aspx rather than just plain stylesheet.css? I have seen this done in various web apps.</p>

<p>The web designer mentioned something about how it's a .NET thing and storing a global variable for the ASPX page but I didn't really understand, nor know the full story.</p>

<p>This is done at my work for a large web app with different sites for different countries.

Is there a performance, architectural or other technical reason for doing so? I can think of several non tech reasons (e.g. SEO considerations).</p>
","33708","Mehrdad Afshari","<p>Probably the stylesheet is not static and is dynamically generated on the server.</p>

<p>This technique can be used to provide a different style sheet by considering several parameters (such as user theme selection or something).</p>

<p><strong>Clarification</strong>: While you can map <code>.css</code> extension in IIS to be handled by ASP.NET. It has two problems:</p>

<ol>
<li>Static CSS files will also get handed down to ASP.NET runtime, which will cause a small performance loss.</li>
<li>In many shared hosting environments, you don't have any control on IIS handler mappings.</li>

<p>goes into an infinite loop because <code>foo</code> references a value that keeps being incremented. Modifying the first line to:</p>

<p><strong>EDIT :</strong> Ok, as Patrick mentions, the infinite loop only happens when there is no prior storage to foo, the cast being pointless, which makes sense. That's indeed what I thought initially while debugging this. Hence my surprise when the cast fixed it.

<p>EDIT1:</p>

<p>At the end it turned out that the best way was to save a nicely formated string for each item I need to select. Thats much better because now I only encode values and never decode them.

<pre><code>XElement elementToChange = xmldoc.Element(""Customers"")
    .Elements(""Customer"")
    .Single(x =&gt; (int)x.Attribute(""ID"") == 2)
    .Element(""Company"");
elementToChange.ReplaceWith(
    new XElement(""Company"", ""new company value..."")
    );
</code></pre>

<h2>ANSWER WITH METHOD SYNTAX:</h2>

<p>Just figured it out in method syntax as well:</p>

<pre><code>XElement elementToChange = (from c in xmldoc.Element(""Customers"")
                                .Elements(""Customer"")
                            where (int)c.Attribute(""ID"") == 3
                            select c).Single().Element(""Company"");

<p>Is this the same for Ruby or PHP. Do you need to learn two languages/technologies to make web applications (not including XHTML/CSS/XML), or do you just learn PHP/Ruby?</p>

"<p>I really like the way ASP.NET MVC works. I'd love to implement it on all new web projects moving forward, but I hit a snag in a prototype the other day that I really haven't found a good solution for, so I ask you, how would you design an MVC app that doesn't fit the typical REST pattern? As an example, the prototype I was designing would have several pages, but the pages themselves aren't necessarily bound to a domain model. For example, take a simple registration site, which might have the following pages:</p>

<ul>
<li>/Default.aspx   </li>
<li>/Register.aspx  </li>
<li>/ThankYou.aspx</li>
</ul>

<p>Occasionally, such a program might require an admin section to deal with such details as moderating sign ups or reviewing data. In a standard ASP.NET web app, I might add the following</p>

<ul>
<li>/Admin/Default.aspx  </li>
<li>/Admin/ListRegistrations.aspx  </li>
<li>/Admin/ViewReports.aspx   ...</li>
</ul>

<p>Would it be an unacceptable deviation from the MVC pattern, in this case, to have two controllers such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Home->Index  </li>
<li>Home->Register  </li>
<li>Home->ThankYou  </li>
<li>Admin->Index  </li>
<li>Admin->ListRegistrations  </li>
<li>Admin->Reports</li>
</ul>

<p>My frustration with this is compounded by the fact that there is no real solid implementation of subcontrollers and areas yet. I'm aware of the ""Areas"" prototype put together by Phil Haack, but it's not very mature, and quite frankly, I'm not sure I like the way it's setup, but I don't really know how I'd like to see that work either.</p>

<p>I guess when I think MVC, I tend to think REST as well, and having controller actions that represent pages rather than actual entities or actions doesn't sit right with me. What do you think?</p>

"<p>I've been given the thrilling task of re-writing our exception handling system.  Whilst I will state that handling exceptions from an application-wide point of view isn't something we want, typically it's unavoidable when our team are understaffed for the sheer amount of work we need to push out the door, so please, no flaming the globalised solution to exception handling here :)</p>

<p>I've had a good hunt to see what common solutions exist.  At the moment we use Global.asax with the Application_Error event to do Server.GetLastError() which is placed in Session state then a redirect is called to another page where the session data is then retrieved and output in a human readable format.  The redirect also calls a sproc which will carefully audit the error information which is a) e-mailed to the developers and b) viewed from a web page only viewable by developers.</p>

<p>The new way I've seen of doing things is using the IHttpModule interface using a class in App_Code to do something along these lines (this is my quick implementation)</p>

<pre><code>Imports Microsoft.VisualBasic

Public Class ErrorModule : Implements IHttpModule

  Public Sub Dispose() Implements System.Web.IHttpModule.Dispose
    ' Not used
  End Sub

  Public Sub Init(ByVal context As System.Web.HttpApplication) Implements System.Web.IHttpModule.Init
    AddHandler context.Error, AddressOf context_Error
  End Sub

  Public Sub context_Error(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs)
    Dim ex As Exception = HttpContext.Current.Server.GetLastError

    ' do something with the error
    ' call the stored procedure
    ' redirect the user to the error page

    HttpContext.Current.Server.ClearError()
    HttpContext.Current.Response.Redirect(""index.htm"")

  End Sub
End Class
</code></pre>

<p>My question is, what is the benefit of this solution over using Global.asax events?  Additionally, what is the best way to hand the data to an error page?</p>

<p><em>EDIT:</em> The code above does work by the way ;)</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Also, how does the HttpModule work behind the scenes?  Does it just register the Error event to that particular function on application start?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>Upon much further investigation it seems grabbing session data is really, really messy when it comes to using IHttpModule interface.  I don't think MS have matured HttpModule enough for it to be used in our particular scenario - until there are events specific to session data it's too dangerous for us to use.</p>

"<p>I'm working on a PHP/MySQL rating system right now. For the user to be able to rate the user has to log in. Each user has a unique ""UID"".

<p>I've seen in other systems that the list is stored in a serialized PHP array. Every time a user votes, then serialized array has to extracted, unserialized, the new UID is inserted, the array is re-serialized, and the MySQL row is UPDATEd. Every time the page is loaded, that list has to once again be unserialized and checked to see if the user viewing the page has voted yet to make sure the user doesn't vote twice. </p>

<p>This seems kind of inefficient and cumbersome. Does MySQL have a built in list function to help this process be more efficient? Are there any more clever ways I could fix this problem?</p>

<p>I've considered one possible alternative which is forget the serializing and store the UIDs in a TEXT type field in the MySQL database. I would just append some non-numeric character after each UID (let's say a period [.]). To add a user entry I would just concatenate the UID onto the end of the TEXT field and then a period. When checking if the user has already voted I could just ""SELECT * FROM table WHERE votes = '%$UID.%';"". Would this work more efficiently or is there a more elegant way of getting the job done?</p>

"<p>I'm pretty new to the ASP.NET world so I'm having a little trouble coming up with the best way to configure a connection string at runtime and have the entire application use that connection string.  Here is a little more info on the application that I plan to build:</p>

<ul>
<li>Application uses Forms authentication, not Windows authentication</li>
<li>There will be a Login page where the user supplies their SQL Server login ID and password</li>
<li>For simplicity, I would like to have all the SQLDataSource controls point to a web.config connection string.  This would be done at design time rather than setting them programatically.  So, they would have a property like this:
 ConnectionString=""&lt;%$ ConnectionStrings:MyDB %>""</li>
<li>I'd like to find a way to change the ""MyDB"" connection string at runtime so it uses the login id and password that the user provided.  But I do NOT want this saved to web.config.  It should only be active for that user's session.</li>
</ul>

<p>What is the ""standard"" way that people usually do this?  I assume one method would be to create a Session variable with the connection string and then programatically change the ConnectionString property of every SQLDataSource control during page load.  But I was hoping to avoid that if possible.</p>

<hr>

<p>Since a number of people asked about why I would want to use a unique connection for each user and were concerned about the lack of pooling, I figured I would comment on that here rather than comment on each individual response.</p>

<p>The nature of this application requires that every user connect to the database under their own account.  The back-end security is tied to their user account so we can't use generic accounts like ""user"" and ""administrator"".  We also need to know the specific identity of each user for auditing control.  The application usually only has 10 to 20 users, so the lack of pooling isn't a concern.  We could debate the merits of this approach another time, but unfortunately I don't have an option here - the project requires that each user connect to the database under their own account.</p>

<p>I would love to require Windows authentication, but unfortunately some implementations of this application will require SQL authentication.</p>

<p>If I could just set the connection string when I declare the SQLDataSource controls like this, it would be a snap:</p>

"<p>
Since I've started using rspec, I've had a problem with the notion of fixtures.  My primary concerns are this:

<ol><li>I use testing to reveal surprising behavior.  I'm not always clever enough to enumerate every possible edge case for the examples I'm testing.  Using hard-coded fixtures seems limiting because it only tests my code with the very specific cases that I've imagined.  (Admittedly, my imagination is also limiting with respect to which cases I test.)</li>
<li>I use testing to as a form of documentation for the code.  If I have hard-coded fixture values, it's hard to reveal what a particular test is trying to demonstrate.  For example:

<pre><code>describe Item do
  describe '#most_expensive' do
    it 'should return the most expensive item' do
      Item.most_expensive.price.should == 100
      # OR
      #Item.most_expensive.price.should == Item.find(:expensive).price
      # OR
      #Item.most_expensive.id.should == Item.find(:expensive).id
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>  Using the first method gives the reader no indication what the most expensive item is, only that its price is 100.  All three methods ask the reader to take it on faith that the fixture :expensive is the most expensive one listed in fixtures/items.yml.  A careless programmer could break tests by creating an Item in before(:all), or by inserting another fixture into fixtures/items.yml.  If that is a large file, it could take a long time to figure out what the problem is.</li></ol>
</p>

<p>
One thing I've started to do is add a '#generate_random' method to all of my models.  This method is only available when I am running my specs.  For example:<pre><code>
class Item
  def self.generate_random(params={})
    Item.create(
      :name => params[:name] || String.generate_random,
      :price => params[:price] || rand(100)
    )
  end
end
</code></pre>
(The specific details of how I do this are actually a bit cleaner.  I have a class that handles the generation and cleanup of all models, but this code is clear enough for my example.)  So in the above example, I might test as follows.  A warning for the feint of heart: my code relies heavily on use of 'before(:all)':
<pre><code>describe Item do
  describe '#most_expensive' do
    before(:all) do
      @items = []
      3.times { @items  50})
    end

    it 'should return the most expensive item' do
      sorted = @items.sort { |a, b| b.price  a.price }
      expensive = Item.most_expensive
      expensive.should be(sorted[0])
      expensive.price.should >= 50      
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>  
</p>

<p>
This way, my tests better reveal surprising behavior.  When I generate data this way, I occasionally stumble upon an edge case where my code does not behave as expected, but which I wouldn't have caught if I were only using fixtures.  For example, in the case of '#most_expensive', if I forgot to handle the special case where multiple items share the most expensive price, my test would occasionally fail at the first 'should.'  Seeing the non-deterministic failures in AutoSpec would clue me in that something was wrong.  If I were only using fixtures, it might take much longer to discover such a bug.
</p>

<p> 
My tests also do a slightly better job of demonstrating in code what the expected behavior is.  My test makes it clear that sorted is an array of items sorted in descending order by price.  Since I expect '#most_expensive' to be equal to the first element of that array, it's even more obvious what the expected behavior of most_expensive is.
</p>

<p>
So, is this a bad practice?  Is my fear of fixtures an irrational one?  Is writing a generate_random method for each Model too much work?  Or does this work?

<p>We can see every parameter parameter have the value of last <code>tag.Name</code> in a cycle.
Have you any idea on how to get arout this and get cycle to add <code>Where</code> with new condition every tyme? I can see IQueryable stores only pointer to variable before execution. </p>
","33708","Mehrdad","<p>Change your <code>foreach</code> to:</p>

<pre><code>foreach (Tag tag in tags){
    var x = tag.Name;

</code></pre>

<p>The reason behind this is lazy evaluation and variable capturing. Basically, what you are doing in the <code>foreach</code> statement is <em>not</em> filtering out results as it might look like. You are building an expression tree that depends on some variables to execute. It's important to note that the actual variables are captured in that expression trees, not their values at the time of capture. Since the variable <code>tag</code> is used every time (and it's scope is the whole <code>foreach</code>, so it won't go out of scope at the end of each iteration), it's captured for every part of the expression and the last value will be used for <em>all</em> of its occurrences. The solution is to use a temporary variable which is scoped <em>in the foreach</em> so it'll go out of scope at each iteration and it the next iteration, it'll be considered a <strong>new variable</strong>.</p>

"<p>ASP.Net MVC is finally available as version 1. I have been waiting for an official release before I try to start using it. At the moment I have a dedicated web server which I have complete access to via remote desktop.

","33708","Mehrdad","<p>I think the concept of <em>editing a record</em> is different from <em>deleting and inserting</em> a new one. Basically, I think an ORM should abstract away primary key generation and other related stuff.

More interestingly, the exception is <em>not</em> thrown if I Continue execution (F5), though things still aren't working correctly.</p>

"<p>Let me try to ask this question from a different angle.  </p>

<p>I noticed that everytime an aspx page gets rendered in the browser using the ""web site"" model, a random assembly gets created 'on-the-fly' in the Temporary ASP.NET files.  Analyzing the assembly in Reflector shows that the class created for any given .aspx file is under the ""ASP"" namespace.</p>

<p>So, starting with a empty ""Temporary ASP.NET Files"" directory, I opened my ASP.NET ""website"" in VS2008, and launched the default page.  Immediately I observed that a random directory was generated inside that folder.  Working my way down the path, I found 2 DLLs created: App_Code.1lywsqqz.dll, and App_Web_iohekame.dll.  I assume that all the .aspx pages in the website get compiled into App_Web dll and everything in App_Code folder gets compiled into App_Code.dll. </p>

<p>So if my App_Code C#/VB.net files are under the ""ASP"" namespace, and my App_Web files are created under the ""ASP"" namespace, how come I still get an error ""Could not load type 'ASP.NothwindDataContext'?  </p>

<p>Somebody said ""you don't need namespaces in the App_Code folder"", but I tried it without and still get ""Could not load type 'NorthwindDataContext'"".  </p>

<p>So what's going on between the App_Code folder, the rest of the site, and namespaces?</p>

<p>EDIT:
Here's my LinqDataSource in my .aspx file:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;asp:LinqDataSource ID=""LinqDataSource1"" runat=""server"" 
	ContextTypeName=""NothwindDataContext"" EnableUpdate=""True"" 
	TableName=""Categories""&gt;
&lt;/asp:LinqDataSource&gt;

","33708","Mehrdad","<p>Types in <code>App_Code</code> C# source files, just like any C# file, will not be put in a specific namespace unless specifically declared by <code>namespace Name {...}</code> around it.

<p>You can reference it in <code>Web.config</code> as: <code>""MyClass, App_Code""</code>.</p>

<p><em>Side note:</em> When you are using a DBML in <code>App_Code</code>, the namespace of generated classes are defined in that file (look at the properties window when DBML file is open).

","33708","Mehrdad","<p>I have a single question test (disclaimer: it's far from perfect, but does the job a lot of time in making you lean toward each of the technologies):  </p>

<p>Is your application more form oriented (e.g. intranet stuff or something) or you are building an Internet-facing Web site (e.g. StackOverflow). In the first case, I'd probably go with Web forms. The latter case is probably better satisfied by ASP.NET MVC.</p>

<p>Another thing: these two are not the only paradigms out there. Before MVC days, I've done several projects by building HTTP Handlers that do the routing and other stuff that MVC does.

"<p>If we want to convert a Page to user control then we should also do the following:</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>I’m not sure I understand the above quote:</p>

<p>Namely, if we  don’t use code behind class, then ascx class will derive directly from UserControl class! 
Thus if we don’t use code behind class, then there won’t be any methods or properties added to a control, so why would web page have problems accessing any of user control’s properties and methods? So why would we need to include a class name in Control directive?</p>

<p>thanx</p>
","33708","Mehrdad","<p>I think I should clarify how the compilation model works. First of all, you can write everything (including C# code) in a single <code>.ascx</code> file and inherit from whatever class you want to (that ultimately inherits from <code>UserControl</code>) by specifying <code>Inherits</code> attribute (or you might want to omit it) and without a <code>ClassName</code> attribute. If you do this, you can still access the properties from the <code>.aspx</code> file that uses this control. The thing is, you can't use the class in the codebehind file of <code>.aspx</code> page (if it has one) directly. By specifying the <code>ClassName</code>, if you are using the Website project model of Visual Studio, you can access it from the <code>.aspx.cs</code> file too. Note that this would not work in Web application project model as every <code>.cs</code> file will be compiled ahead of the time (prior to the <code>.ascx</code> file). In that case, even <code>ClassName</code> attribute wouldn't help much.</p>

<p>In any case, strictly none of the attributes are necessary. You can always use the properties defined anywhere in <code>.ascx</code> or <code>.ascx.cs</code> file included in a page in the <code>.aspx</code> file (but <em>not</em> always <code>.aspx.cs</code> file).</p>

<p><strong>Edit to address the update to the question:</strong></p>

<p>A) From your source code, it seems you are using the Website model here. Note that I mentioned you cannot use the <em>class</em> directly. I agree this statement might have been a little misleading. What I wanted to note is that without a <code>ClassName</code>, ASP.NET will choose a name for your user control class but that name is not guaranteed. While you <em>can</em> use the generated name, it's not recommended at all. You should treat it pretty much like an anonymous type where you can use an instance but cannot mention a name. In your example, you are basically referencing an instance (which is constructed on the <code>.aspx</code> markup), not the <em>class</em>, which is OK.</p>

<p>B) What you are saying is correct. Whatever you declare in <code>ascx.cs</code> in a Web application will be visible to <code>.aspx.cs</code> and <code>.aspx</code>. What I was talking about is properties that you declare in <code>.ascx</code> in a <code>&lt;script runat=""server""&gt;</code> tag. Those will not be visible to <code>.aspx.cs</code> since it's compiled beforehand.</p>

<p>C) ASP.NET will generate the class defined by the <code>ClassName</code> attribute in the <code>ASP</code> namespace. You should use <code>ASP.Some_Name</code> instead. There is one thing I forgot to mention: in this case, you should somehow reference the <code>.ascx</code> in the <code>.aspx</code> markup; either with a <code>Reference</code> directive (<code>&lt;%@ Reference Control=""MyControl.ascx"" %&gt;</code>) directive or with a <code>Register</code> directive (<code>&lt;%@ Register TagPrefix=""abc"" TagName=""xyz"" Src=""MyControl.ascx"" %&gt;</code>). This will ensure that the ASP.NET build engine puts the generated <code>.ascx</code> class in the same assembly as <code>.aspx</code> page.</p>

"<p>I've been programming in C# for...a while now. I coded a routine recently and it occurred to me that it was the first time (that I could recall) that I deliberately used bare code blocks (i.e. with no preceding control-flow statement). The code looks vaguely like this:</p>

"<p>Currently we generate classes in <code>App_Code</code> by returning all the sprocs from all of our databases and adding the correct parameter types and names to a <code>SqlCommand</code> object and then returning it in one giant class.  This means we can do things like <code>MyCmd.cmd.Parameters(""MyParam"").Value = ""whatever""</code> when we want to pass parameters to a <code>SqlCommand</code> for a stored procedure without having to add the parameters with their relative data types every single time we make a call.  It also means that we have to look up the exposed parameters for each sproc because they are merely strings.</p>

<p>To put it into perspective, for every parameter you want to deal with in a sproc you'd have to do this:</p>

<p>price info and price details are related to product and are lists</p>

<p>In my web forms approach I would store my main product object on the view state and I would populate it's pricing info and details while doing ajax postbacks. This way I can create a compact module that is very user friendly in terms of defining a lot of data from one place without the need to enter these data from seperate modules.

","33708","Mehrdad","<p>I believe the best way of doing this is storing the data on the client side. It reduces unnecessary postbacks and improves responsiveness of your application. If you really want to store it on the server, you can use <code>SessionState</code>.</p>

"<p>In .net, unlike in Java, methods are not virtual by default.

","33708","Mehrdad","<p>If I have to choose between the two, I'd go with the interface thing. An interface is meant to define a contract, which is basically what a mock object is going to adhere to.

An interface merely defines method names and will have no effect on the real class.</p>

I realize I'm moving the data access to the code layer in a way since I'm then filtering out for example a toplist with linq queries.

It essentially calls that function with every element of the array and returns the index of the first element for which that function returns true.</p>

"<p>I am not sure how to phrase a good question, so I will just say what I am after!</p>

<p>I have to retool a web application for our vendors and part of that requires restricting content on a vendor by vendor basis.  Looking at ASP.NET (MVC) this seems easy enough using the built in Authorization Filters and the IPrincipal and IIdentity interfaces (I haven't used them yet, just reading, so I may be using these terms incorrectly!).</p>

<p>What I'm not interested in doing is writing all the code for managing users and roles.  I would love to be able to assume all of this is done for me by a third party application, and my code simply specifies roles required.</p>

<p>Now, I'm not exactly sure the product I am after, or if it even exists.  Is this a CMS?  Right now our vendor site uses a very old version of DNN.  Some of our existing custom code is written as a module within DNN.  I am not interesting in this type of solution at all.  I want to be able to build a standard ASP.NET webapp and not be tied to a certain vendor 'module' definition.  It seems like this should be possible if the CMS / Portal implement custom providers behind the ASP.NET provided API's, yah?</p>

<p>The primary (only) customer here is developers, if that makes sense.</p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I really don't need a full blown CMS, which is why I'm confused on what type of product to search for.  Some CMS functionality might be nice, but the site is only for very specific vendor interaction that is going to be 95% custom.</p></li>

It provides others with its public key so it needs to know it. So in essence, that ""private key"" will contain ""public key"" information or at least it can be derived from it.</p>

<p>Generally, you cannot swap private and public keys. In fact, they are not always of the same type (depending on the cryptosystem used).  For instance, in ECDSA, your public key is a two-dimensional ""point"" on an elliptic curve, whereas your private key is a number.</p>

","33708","Mehrdad","<p>You usually don't do that with user controls (<code>.ascx</code>). It's completely possible though. This is mostly done in custom controls you build using code files. To accomplish it, you declare your control class like:</p>

"<p>I'm writing a game development IDE that creates and compiles .NET projects (which I've been working on for the past few years) and am in the process of updating it to generate output not only for Windows/Visual Studio, but also for Linux/MonoDevelop (a thrillingly simple process for .NET, but still requiring some tweaks). </p>

<p>As part of this, I have found it necessary to start generating an app.config file as part of this to map dependent DLL names to Linux dependency names with &lt;dllmap&gt; elements.  I'm confused about who's responsible for copying the app.config file to the output name app.exe.config. In a Visual Studio project, the Build Action for app.config seems to normally be set to ""None"" and its settings indicate that it won't be copied anywhere, yet when Visual Studio compiles the project it generates app.exe.config (though I've sometimes found this to be unreliable).  When I use MSBuild to build a solution file generated by the IDE (for debugging purposes), MSBuild copies app.config to app.exe.config.  But when I compile the project with CSharpCodeProvider.CompileAssemblyFromFile it (naturally) doesn't like the config file being included as source code (""app.config(1,1) : error CS0116: A namespace does not directly contain members such as fields or methods""), and of course it doesn't copy it to the output when I don't include it as an input.  Is it my responsibility to simply copy app.config to app.exe.config independently, or is there a more standard way of doing this?</p>

<p>Is it hardwired to take the first *.config file?  In my IDE it's conceivable that the app.config file would be renamed or another one added (just as in Visual Studio).  It seems odd to me that the IDE has this secret action for config files (I think MonoDevelop behaves similarly in this regard because I couldn't find a special action for config files there either). I don't know how it even picks to what files this secret action applies.</p>

Otherwise, taking that route might get you completely off the OOP conventions and benefits (By the way, this is the important point.

"<p>I believe the factory method design pattern is appropriate for what I'm trying to do, but I'm not sure how much responsibility (knowledge of subclasses it creates) to give it.  The example of using the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory%5Fmethod%5Fpattern"">factory method pattern</a> at Wikipedia describes the situation I'm in almost exactly:</p>

<pre><code>public class ImageReaderFactory 
{
    public static ImageReader getImageReader( InputStream is ) 
    {
        int imageType = figureOutImageType( is );

        switch( imageType ) 
        {
            case ImageReaderFactory.GIF:
                return new GifReader( is );
            case ImageReaderFactory.JPEG:
                return new JpegReader( is );
            // etc.
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>My question is, what does the <code>figureOutImageType</code> function look like?  In this specific example, I would assume that it checks a file header in the <code>InputStream</code> to determine which image format the data is in.  I would like to know if the <code>ImageReaderFactory</code> itself knows how to parse file headers and determine if the file type is GIF, JPEG, etc, or if it calls a function inside each <code>Reader</code> class that lets it know what type of image it is.  Something like this, maybe:</p>

<pre><code>int figureOutImageType(InputStream is)
{
    if(GifReader.isGIF(is))
        return ImageReaderFactory.GIF;
    else if(JpegReader.isJPEG(is))
        return ImageReaderFactory.JPEG;
    // etc.
}

<p>It seems like having the factory know how to parse images breaks encapsulation, and letting the subclasses decide which one should be created is part of the factory method design pattern.  Yet, it also seems like the <code>figureOutImageType</code> function is just adding some redundant code, because why not just have each subclass perform its check on the <code>InputStream</code> in the <code>getImageReader</code> function and skip the switch case?  </p>

<p>I haven't had any experience using factories before, and I was hoping to get some insight from some people who have used them in the past on the best way to handle this problem.  Is it okay to have the factory know about the inner workings of its subclasses, or should they be responsible for letting the factory know which to create, and how do you organize it all?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","33708","Mehrdad","<p>Factory should have some idea about choosing the actual object to create. For example, <code>WebRequest.Create</code> method in .NET, should be able to choose between the different protocol clients by checking the protocol part of the <code>Uri</code>. It doesn't need to parse the whole thing. Just the part required to distinguish which class is going to be responsible for it (in your example, it'll probably be just the file header).</p>

<p>Regarding your question about breaking encapsulation, not really... Most of the time, the factory is hardcoded and already knows about different types of classes and their features. It already depends on the functionality offered by a known set of classes, so you are not adding much to it. You can also encapsulate the detection part of the factory in another helper class that can be used both by the factory and the subclasses (in the sprit of DRY principle).</p>

"<p>I have an ASP.NET page that is interacting with a business class. I want to continuously update controls on my page based on user entered values, e.g. update totals. The calculations are embedded in business logic but they're simple enough to reproduce elsewhere. I've thought of three ways to accomplish this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Dynamically update the page using JavaScript. I don't want to do this because I don't want to risk floating point math problems where the values on the page don't match the values calculated by the business class (those properties are decimals).</li>
<li>Clear calculated fields on changes and force the user to click a re-calculate button. This is a poor user experience and wiring up JavaScript to ASP.NET controls is tedious.</li>
<li>Use an AJAX UpdatePanel, set data entry controls to autopostback, and handle the ""changed"" event for the control, e.g. TextChanged for TextBox.</li>
</ol>

<p>The third method seems cleanest to me, provides a nice user experience, and allows me to interact directly with my business class that I've stored in session state.</p>

<p>My question is: Is this a good idea and/or a common practice? Are there better ways to accomplish this?</p>

<p>I haven't done ASP.NET work for a few years and I have a prejudice against autopostback[1]. I've looked at the size of the request and it's currently negligible at 1.5kB. The site will be low use but we may have a small number of users with dial-up connections.</p>

<p><em>Side note:</em> Interestingly enough, C# supports a feature (<em>misfeature?</em>) called <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa664572(VS.71).aspx"">array covariance</a>. It means if <code>Derived</code> is a reference that can be converted to <code>Base</code>, you can implicitly cast <code>Derived[]</code> to <code>Base[]</code> (which might be unsafe in some circumstances, see below). This is true <strong>only for arrays</strong> and not <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> or other stuff. The opposite (array contravariance) is not true, that is, you cannot cast <code>object[]</code> to <code>string[]</code>.</p>

<p>C# version 4.0 is going to support safe covariance and contravariance for generics too.</p>

<p>If you go to the Dataset, it show keys next to both columns and says that there is a constraint with both columns being checked.</p>

<p>Is there a way of just making sure that you are not inserting a duplicate copy of a record into the table without individual columns being unique?</p>

<p>I tried controling it with my sql insert statement but that did not work. This is what I tried.</p>

<p>INSERT INTO [FriendRequests] ([UserId], [FriendUserId]) VALUES ('""+UserId+""', '""+PossibleFriend+""') WHERE NOT EXIST (SELECT [UserId], [FriendUserId] FROM [FriendRequests])</p>

"<p>Because of the confusion between all the info that is out there about mvc from all the preview releases and the one official release I am very confused how to deal with viewusercontrols.
So once and for all, tell me how to implement this example:</p>

<p>I have a list of upcoming events that needs to be displayed on several pages of my website. Therefore I have put a new ViewUserControl (ListEvents.ascx) inside my Views\Shared folder.</p>

<p>I am requesting this ListEvents.ascx to render on my Home/Index view like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;
    Here's a list of events:
    &lt;% Html.RenderPartial(""ListEvents"");%&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

<p>How would I go about passing my model to this viewusercontrol? I know I can do this:</p>

    Here's a list of events:
    &lt;% Html.RenderPartial(""ListEvents"", (new Model.Services.EventService(null)).ListEvents());%&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But that doesn't seem like a very smart thing to do, creating a new model from inside a view?! Or am I wrong here? I can't even pass any validationstate, hence the null parameter.
So an alternative option is to store this data into the ViewData[] member, but my viewusercontrol is not supposed to be dependant on the ViewData of it's parent!</p>

<p>I'm sure there is a very simple answer to this, please share as I'm done browsing the web for this problem.</p>

A viewusercontrol should always receive it's model from the View in which it resides. Working around this, like by adding a codebehind file to a viewusercontrol, would break the MVC pattern.</p>

","33708","Mehrdad","<p>Classic mode (the only mode in IIS6 and below) is a mode where IIS only works with ISAPI extensions and ISAPI filters directly. In fact, in this mode, ASP.NET is just an ISAPI extension (aspnet_isapi.dll) and an ISAPI filter (aspnet_filter.dll). IIS just treats ASP.NET as an external plugin implemented in ISAPI and works with it like a black box (and only when it's needs to give out the request to ASP.NET). In this mode, ASP.NET is not much different from PHP or other technologies for IIS.</p>

<p>Integrated mode, on the other hand, is a new mode in IIS7 where IIS pipeline is tightly integrated (i.e. is just the same) as ASP.NET request pipeline. ASP.NET can see every request it wants to and manipulate things along the way. ASP.NET is no longer treated as an external plugin. It's completely blended and integrated in IIS. In this mode, ASP.NET <code>HttpModule</code>s basically have nearly as much power as an ISAPI filter would have had and ASP.NET <code>HttpHandler</code>s can have nearly equivalent capability as an ISAPI extension could have.

","33708","","<p>There are many cases in which the application should not assume much about itself and should look at runtime to see what it actually is. This is where reflection comes into the show. For example, ASP.NET makes no assumption about the membership provider you use except that it inherits the appropriate class. It uses reflection to lookup the class at runtime and instantiate it. This gives out a great deal of extensibility due to decoupling and decreasing dependencies between classes.</p>

"<h2>Background</h2>

<p>I have two objects which have bidirectional association between them in a C# project I am working on. I need to be able to check for value equality (vs reference equality) for a number of reasons (e.g to use them in collections) and so I am implementing IEquatable and the related functions.</p>

<h2>Assumptions</h2>

<ul>
<li>I am using C# 3.0, .NET 3.5, and Visual Studio 2008 (although it shouldn't matter for equality comparison routine issue).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Constraints</h2>

<p>Any solution must:</p>

<ul>
<li>Allow for bidirectional association to remain intact while permitting checking for value equality.</li>
<li>Allow the external uses of the class to call Equals(Object obj) or Equals(T class) from IEquatable and receive the proper behavior (such as in System.Collections.Generic).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Problem</h2>

<p>When implementing IEquatable to provide checking for value equality on types with bidirectional association, infinite recursion occurs resulting in a stack overflow.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Similarly, using all of the fields of a class in the GetHashCode calculation will result in a similar infinite recursion and resulting stack overflow issue.</p>

","33708","","<p>This doesn't work since the <code>GridView</code> is data bound and is going to fetch the actual data at a later time while rendering the page. You should check this by directly querying the data binding source of the gridview (see if the actual list that's grid view bound to is empty or not).</p>

<p>If you just want to display something when it's empty, you should use <code>&lt;EmptyDataTemplate&gt;</code> in your markup:</p>

"<p>I have an application that performs a write to a database each time a page is requested. This db write is not time critical, so for performance reasons, I have the page queuing the object using MSMQ. Of course, I have to have something to read the queue and process requests, so I wrote a class that looks similar to this:</p>

<pre><code>public class QueueProcessor {
    public void Start() 
    {
        // Create background thread to run ProcessInternal()
    }

    public void Stop() 
    {
        // Stop the previously created thread
    }

    public void ProcessInternal() 
    {
        while (runnable) 
        {
            // check queue for messages, process them one at a time, 
            // then wait indefinitely for more messages
        }
    } 
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, since this web site is fairly small in nature, I realy don't want to have to add a windows service to the deployment routine, so what I'm doing at this time is creating a new QueueProcessor in the Application_Start event and starting it there. My thought is that the thread will run for the life of the application, and if the application gets killed by IIS, it will merely start up again the next time someone accesses a page.</p>

<p>To prevent long periods of idle where queued messages are not processed because the application has been killed by IIS, I've set up a wget request to execute every few minutes on one of the site's pages, thus keeping the application alive and ensuring the background thread will keep running.</p>

<p>My question is, I don't see this design very often, and I'm wondering if there are any potential problems with it? </p>

<p>EDIT: </p>

<p>After doing some reading on the subject, I found that the major problem with this approach (and similar ones, such as the cache removal callback function) is the type of function they were being asked to perform with regards to scalability. For example, if you're doing a mass update or something, you obviously don't want the task running on all of your web servers - you'll have conflicting updates and potential data loss that way. </p>

<p>However, in my very particular case, the thread is processing ONLY requests received by that server that are sitting in that server's message queue. Therefore, if I were to scale this app to say 5 servers, each thread would process each server's queued messages without any problems. Again, the order of the records in the database isn't so important that a few similar requests from different servers within a small interval would be a problem, so I still think this solution is reasonable for my problem.</p>
","33708","","<p>I believe setting up the wget request is not much easier than deploying a Windows service.
Other than that, I don't see any specific problems with it. If reliability and accurate timing isn't critical, this would work.</p>

<h2>Side Note:</h2>

<p>Optimization at this level is inherently architecture dependent. Today's processors are <em>too complex</em> (in terms of branch prediction, cache misses, pipelining) that it's so hard to predict which code is executed faster on which architecture. Decreasing operations from 32 to 9 or things like that might even decrease the performance on some architectures. Optimized code on a single architecture might result in worse code in the other. I think you'd either optimize this for a specific CPU or leave it as it is and let the compiler to choose what it thinks it's better.</p>
"
"<p>I'm using a library that generates a bunch of classes for me.</p>

<p>These classes all inherit from a common base class but that base class doesn't define a couple methods that are common to all subclasses.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>SubClassA : BaseClass{
  void Add(ItemA item) {...}
  ItemA CreateNewItem() {...}
}

SubClassB: BaseClass{
  void Add(ItemB item) {...}
  ItemB CreateNewItem() {...}
}
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately, the base class <strong>doesn't have these methods</strong>. This would be great:</p>

<pre><code>BaseClass{
  // these aren't actually here, I'm just showing what's missing:
  abstract void Add(ItemBaseClass item);  // not present!
  abstract ItemBaseClass CreateNewItem(); // not present!
}
</code></pre>

<p>Since there is a common base class for my  A+B objects and a common base class for the Item objects, I had hoped to benefit from the wonderful world of polymorphism.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, since the common methods aren't actually present in the base class, I can't call them virtually. e.g., this would be perfect:</p>

<pre><code>BaseClass Obj;
Obj = GetWorkUnit(); // could be SubClassA or SubClassB

ItemBaseClass Item = Obj.CreateNewItem(); // Compile Fail: CreateNewItem() isn't in the base class

Item.DoSomething();

Obj.Add(Item); // Compile Fail: Add(...) isn't in the base class
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously casting would work but then I'd need to know which type I had which would negate the benefits.</p>

<p>How can I ""force"" a call to these methods? I'm not worried about getting an object that doesn't implement the method I'm trying to call. I can actually do what I want in VB--I don't get intellisense but the compiler's happy and it works:</p>

<pre><code>CType(Obj, Object).Add(Item) // Note: I'm using C#--NOT VB

"<p>I understand Big-O notation, but I don't know how to calculate it for many functions. In particular, I've been trying to figure out the computational complexity of the naive version of the Fibonacci sequence:</p>

    else

","33708","Mehrdad Afshari","<p>You model the time function to calculate <code>Fib(n)</code> as sum of time to calculate <code>Fib(n-1)</code> plus the time to calculate <code>Fib(n-2)</code> plus the time to add them together (<code>O(1)</code>).</p>

<p><code>T(n&lt;=1) = O(1)</code></p>

<p><code>T(n) = T(n-1) + T(n-2) + O(1)</code></p>

<p>You solve this recurrence relation (using generating functions, for instance) and you'll end up with the answer.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can draw the recursion tree, which will have depth <code>n</code> and intuitively figure out that this function is asymptotically <code>O(2</code><sup><code>n</code></sup><code>)</code>. You can then prove your conjecture by induction.</p>

<p>Base: <code>n = 1</code> is obvious</p>

<p>Assume <code>T(n-1) = O(2</code><sup><code>n-1</code></sup><code>)</code>, <i>therefore</i> </p>

<p><code>T(n) = T(n-1) + T(n-2) + O(1)</code> <i>which is equal to</i></p>

<p><code>T(n) = O(2</code><sup><code>n-1</code></sup><code>) + O(2</code><sup><code>n-2</code></sup><code>) + O(1) = O(2</code><sup><code>n</code></sup><code>)</code></p>

<p>However, as noted in a comment, this is not the tight bound. An interesting fact about this function is that the T(n) is asymptotically <b>the same</b> as the value of <code>Fib(n)</code> since both are defined as </p>

<p><code>f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)</code>. </p>

<p>The leaves of the recursion tree will always return 1. The value of <code>Fib(n)</code> is sum of all values returned by the leaves in the recursion tree which is equal to the count of leaves. Since each leaf will take O(1) to compute, <code>T(n)</code> is equal to <code>Fib(n) x O(1)</code>. Consequently, the tight bound for this function is the Fibonacci sequence itself (~<code>θ(1.6</code><sup><code>n</code></sup><code>)</code>). You can find out this tight bound by using generating functions as I'd mentioned above.</p>

"<p>I really don't understand what the problem is with those people who ask you not to use JavaScript on your site. </p>

<p><img src=""http://www.beholdgenealogy.com/img/no_javascript.gif"" alt=""Why the paranoia?""></p>

<p>I went through all sorts of trouble trying to remove a couple of JavaScript scripts I used on one of my sites <a href=""http://groups.google.com/group/soc.genealogy.computing/browse_thread/thread/fc76732425d5f24f"">to appease a couple of ""complainers""</a>. A month later, after a relentless attack by spam bots, I decided I better add the JavaScript spam prevention code back in.</p>

<p>JavaScript is obviously used by a lot of programmers. It is currently the 6th most popular tag here at Stack Overflow. It is used on practically every single website that I know of. </p>

<p>The claim that it is a security risk seems bogus to me. I've had JavaScript on in my browser for as long as I remember, and not once have I found out that anything malicious has happened.</p>

<p>JavaScript has, of course, been extended into AJAX. And AJAX is the thing that makes the wonderful world of Web 2.0 work. And that includes this wonderful Stack Overflow site.</p>

<p>So is there something I'm missing? Is there something wrong with JavaScript that I'm not aware of?</p>

<hr>

<p>Follow-up:</p>

<p>I am flabbergasted by the response to my Question.</p>

<p>The responses are strong and vociferous from the Anti-JavaScript people.</p>

<p>There was one pro-JavaScript comment, and it was voted down (as I write this to -2) by the others.</p>

<p>I turned JavaScript off to add this follow-up. I immediately notice three obvious things (There might be more):</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A big annoying white on red banner at the top of each page saying: ""Stack Overflow works best with JavaScript enabled"". (Annoyance) </p></li>
<li><p>Comments cannot be viewed at all or added. You can't vote up or vote down. You can't select the accepted answer. (Loss of functionality)</p></li>
<li><p>Of course none of the AJAX stuff works. I don't have access to the line of editing tools above this entry box, and I can't see the preview as I type this. (Inconveniences)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So as far as I am concerned, turning your JavaScript off results in Annoyances, Loss of Functionality, and Inconvenience.</p>

<p>I'm sorry for the handicapped people who have no JavaScript support, but I still don't get why so many of you are so religiously against using it. </p>

<p>Personally, I love what AJAX and its beautiful interfaces and enhanced functionality are doing to the Web. I try to add such features to my site and it annoys me when the Anti-JavaScript people ask me - no, demand of me to take it out because they can't access them. </p>

<p>But how many of you use Stack Overflow with JavaScript off? None I would expect. Your answer would be that you turn it on for sites you trust like Stack Overflow.</p>

<p>Okay. If I make a site that uses Ajax or JavaScript, then I'm fine with you turning it off until you decide to trust my site. But don't expect me to be required to give you all the functionality that I do to people who trust me. Even Stack Overflow doesn't. </p>

<p>If someone wants to embellish this idea, I'll give them the accepted answer.</p>

<p>Followup.  I found the following opinion about JavaScript at the <a href=""http://www.polepositionmarketing.com/library/wp-spamfree/#wpsf_how_it_works"">WP-SpamFree WordPress Plugin page</a>:</p>

<p>""Most of the spam hitting your blog originates from bots. Few bots can process JavaScript. Few bots can process cookies. Fewer still, can handle both. In a nutshell, this plugin uses a combo of JavaScript and cookies (on steroids) to weed out the humans from spambots, preventing 99%+ of automated spam from ever getting to your site. Almost 100% of web site visitors will have these turned on by default, so this type of solution works silently in the background, with no inconveniences. There are extremely few users (less than 2%) that have JavaScript and/or cookies turned off by default, but they will be prompted to turn those back on to post their comment.</p>

<p>Stats show that among all Internet users, less than 2% have JavaScript turned off, and less than 1% have cookies turned off. This requirement isn’t anything out of the ordinary because most modern websites require the use of JavaScript and cookies for key features — AJAX, for example, won’t work if JS is disabled.</p>

<p><strong>Overall, the very few that might be inconvenienced because they have JS and cookies turned off will be far fewer than the 100% who would be annoyed by CAPTCHA’s, challenge questions, and other validation methods.</strong>""</p>

Believe me, there is one thing I've seen in every good developer: ""They never stop learning, and they don't go to learn just the piece of code they need to complete their job.""

"<p>I have a webpage on my site that displays a table, reloads the XML source data every 10 seconds (with an XmlHttpRequest), and then updates the table to show the user any additions or removals of the data. To do this, the JavaScript function first clears out all elements from the table and then adds a new row for each unit of data.</p>

<p>Recently, I battled thru a number of memory leaks in Internet Explorer caused by this DOM destroy-and-create code (most of them having to do with circular references between JavaScript objects and DOM objects, and the JavaScript library we are using quietly keeping a reference to every JS object created with <code>new Element(...)</code> until the page is unloaded). </p>

<p>With the memory problems solved, we've now uncovered a CPU-based problem: when the user has a large amount of data to view (100+ units of data, which equals 100 <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code> nodes to create, plus all of the table cells for each column), the process ties up the CPU until Internet Explorer prompts the user with:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Stop running this script?<br />
  A script on this page is causing Internet Explorer to run slowly.
  If it continues to run, your computer may become
  unresponsive.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems that running the row-and-cell-creation code times 100+ pieces of data is what is causing the CPU usage to spike, the function to take ""too long"" (from IE's perspective) to run, thus causing IE to generate this warning for the user. I've also noticed that while the ""update screen"" function runs for the 100 rows, IE does not re-render the table contents until the function completes (since the JS interpreter is using 100% CPU for that time period, I assume).</p>

<p>So my question is: Is there any way in JavaScript to tell the browser to pause JS execution and re-render the DOM? If not, are there any strategies for handling creating large amounts of DOM nodes and <em>not</em> having the browser choke? </p>

<p>One method I can think of would be to handle the ""update table"" logic asynchronously; that is, once the Ajax method to reload the XML data is complete, put the data into some sort of array, and then set a function (using <code>setInterval()</code>) to run which will handle one element of the array at a time. However this seems a little bit like re-creating threading in a JavaScript environment, which seems like it could get very complicated (i.e. what if another Ajax data request fires while I'm still re-creating the table's DOM nodes?, etc.)  </p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p><strong>update</strong>: Just wanted to explain why I'm accepting RoBurg's answer. In doing some testing, I've found that the <code>new Element()</code> method in my framework (I'm using <a href=""http://mootools.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">mootools</a>) is about 2x as slow as the traditional <code>document.createElement()</code> in IE7. I ran a test to create 1000 <code>&lt;spans&gt;</code> and add them to a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, using <code>new Element()</code> takes about 1800ms on IE7 (running on Virtual PC), the traditional method takes about 800ms.</p>

<p>My test also revealed an even quicker method, at least for a simple test such as mine: using <a href=""http://ejohn.org/blog/dom-documentfragments/"" rel=""nofollow"">DocumentFragments as described by John Resig</a>.

"<p>Sometimes I see Θ(n) with the strange Θ symbol with something in the middle of it, and sometimes just O(n). Is it just laziness of typing because nobody knows how to type this symbol, or does it mean something different?</p>
","33708","Mehrdad Afshari","<h3>Short explanation:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>If an algorithm is of Θ(g(n)), it means that the running time of the algorithm as n (input size) gets larger is proportional to g(n).</p>
  
  <p>If an algorithm is of O(g(n)), it means that the running time of the algorithm as n gets larger is <b>at most</b> proportional to g(n).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Normally, even when people talk about O(g(n)) they actually mean Θ(g(n)) but technically, there is a difference. </p>

<hr />

<h3>More technically:</h3>

<p>O(n) represents upper bound. Θ(n) means tight bound.
Ω(n) represents lower bound.</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>f(x) = Θ(g(x)) iff f(x) =
    O(g(x)) and f(x) = Ω(g(x))</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>For example, <em>an</em> upper bound for the naive recursive approach to compute Fibonacci sequence is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fib(x) = O(2<sup>n</sup>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>but the tight bound is </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fib(x) = Θ(F<sub>n</sub>) where F<sub>n</sub> is the Fibonacci sequence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>which is also a valid upper bound.</p>

<p>Basically when we say an algorithm is of O(n), it's also O(n<sup>2</sup>), O(n<sup>1000000</sup>), O(2<sup>n</sup>), ... but a Θ(n) algorithm is <strong>not</strong> Θ(n<sup>2</sup>).</p>

<p>In fact, since f(n) = Θ(g(n)) means for sufficiently large values of n, f(n) can be bound within c<sub>1</sub>g(n) and c<sub>2</sub>g(n) for some values of c<sub>1</sub> and c<sub>2</sub>, i.e. the growth rate of f is asymptotically equal to g: g can be a lower bound <strong>and</strong> and an upper bound of f. This directly implies f can be a lower bound and an upper bound of g as well. Consequently,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>f(x) = Θ(g(x)) iff g(x) = Θ(f(x))</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Similarly, to show f(n) = Θ(g(n)), it's enough to show g is an upper bound of f (i.e. f(n) = O(g(n))) and f is a lower bound of g (i.e. f(n) = Ω(g(n)) which is the exact same thing as g(n) = O(f(n))). Concisely,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>f(x) = Θ(g(x)) iff f(x) = O(g(x)) and g(x) = O(f(x))</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>There are also small-oh and small-omega (<code>ω</code>) notations representing loose upper and loose lower bounds of a function. </p>

<p>To summarize:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>f(x) = O(g(x))</code> (big-oh) means that
  the growth rate of <code>f(x)</code> is
  asymptotically <b>less than or equal
  to</b> to the growth rate of <code>g(x)</code>.</p>
  
  <p><code>f(x) = Ω(g(x))</code> (big-omega) means
  that the growth rate of <code>f(x)</code> is
  asymptotically <b>greater than or
  equal to</b> the growth rate of <code>g(x)</code></p>
  
  <p><code>f(x) = o(g(x))</code> (small-oh) means that
  the growth rate of <code>f(x)</code> is
  asymptotically <b>less than</b> the
  growth rate of <code>g(x)</code>.</p>
  
  <p><code>f(x) = ω(g(x))</code> (small-omega) means
  that the growth rate of <code>f(x)</code> is
  asymptotically <b>greater than</b> the

  <p><code>f(x) = Θ(g(x))</code> (theta) means that

"<p>One of the stated reasons for knowing assembler is that, on occasion, it can be employed to write code that will be more performant than writing that code in a higher-level language, C in particular.

","33708","","<p>Ooh, it's not easy at all. <code>Func&lt;T&gt;</code> represents a generic <code>delegate</code> and not an expression. If there's any way you could do so (due to optimizations and other things done by the compiler, some data might be thrown away, so it might be impossible to get the original expression back), it'd be disassembling the IL on the fly and inferring the expression (which is by no means easy). Treating lambda expressions as data (<code>Expression&lt;Func&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code>) is a magic done by the <strong>compiler</strong> (basically the compiler builds an expression tree in code instead of compiling it to IL).</p>

<h3>Related fact</h3>

<p>This is why languages that push lambdas to the extreme (like Lisp) are often easier to implement as <strong>interpreters</strong>. In those languages, code and data are essentially the same thing (even at <em>run time</em>), but our chip cannot understand that form of code, so we have to emulate such a machine by building an interpreter on top of it that understands it (the choice made by Lisp like languages) or sacrificing the power (code will no longer be exactly equal to data) to some extent (the choice made by C#). In C#, the compiler gives the illusion of treating code as data by allowing lambdas to be interpreted as <strong>code</strong> (<code>Func&lt;T&gt;</code>) and <strong>data</strong> (<code>Expression&lt;Func&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code>) at <em>compile time</em>.</p>

<h3>A rough summary of concepts</h3>

<p><strong>Abstraction</strong> is about the whole idea of modeling a real-world concept in terms of objects rather than thinking about function calls or other stuff. It's basically thinking about objects as separate entities.</p>

<p><strong>Encapsulation</strong> is the act of hiding implementation of an object from the outside world behind well-defined interfaces.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Inheritance</strong> is the relationship between derived classes and base classes and categorization of concepts. It defines ""is-a"" relationship between too entities, adding the ability of using derived classes where a base is expected.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Polymorphism</strong> means two objects are similar in interface but behave in different ways (think about <code>virtual</code> methods).</p>

<p><strong>Aggregation</strong> defines a ""has-a"" relationship between two concepts. Means an object is composed out of another entity.</p>

The column in my <code>DataGridView</code> for the item's due date always has an <code>int</code> value. <code>0</code> indicates the event is never due, any other value is a UTC timestamp for the due date. The MySQL db column corresponding doesn't allow nulls. When the user has moved from one <code>DataGridView</code> row with a due date, to another <code>DataGridView</code> row with a due date (at this point everything is still appears fine), and then presses a button which reloads the data from the database (without sending updates, essentially calling <code>DataAdapter.Fill()</code>), the program generates a <code>StackOverflowException</code>**.</p>

"<p>I roamed the site for this question using the search engine, and I don't think it's out there. If it is, apologies in advance and feel free to point me to it. </p>

<p>Here is my scenario: </p>

<p>I am setting up a web application, Moodle if anyone is familiar with it, with Apache, MySQL, and php on Windows. Moodle supports enabling SSL for login, but then reverts to regular http after login is established. This is running on an internal network with no connection to the outside world, so no Internet access through this network. All users who use the network have logins, however there are some generic guest type logins with certain restricted privilages. Currently the MySQL database is not encrypted.</p>

<p>My question is this: </p>

<p>If my users do an SSL login, and the system then reverts back to http for the remainder of their session, how vulnerable is the data that is transferred back and forth between the browser interface and the database?</p>

<p>I would perhaps prefer to have all the data encrypted, but I am not sure how bad the performance hit would be to do that, so any suggestions concerning that would be appreciated too. Although I will be extending the functionality in Moodle, I don't necessarily want to have to change it to encrypt everything if already does.</p>

<p>However, when I clear the validated control and submit an empty string, the validator thinks it's OK, and I get an error from my server side validation.  Anyone know what is wrong here, except for the broken contract of the RegularExpressionValidator?</p>
","33708","","<p>It is by design. You should also add a <code>RequiredFieldValidator</code> to force user entry. <code>RegularExpressionValidator</code> assumes empty fields as valid (and doesn't even run them through <code>Regex</code>). The reason behind this is that for instance, you might have an optional <code>Email address 2</code> field in the form that is not required, but if it's entered, it should be a valid email address. To achieve this easily, other validators ignore empty fields and if you need to make them required, you'd just add another <code>RequiredFieldValidator</code>.</p>

<p>In fact, it's not necessary to <strong>manually</strong> revalidate on server. ASP.NET validators also support server-side validation built it. You could just check <code>Page.IsValid</code> property. </p>

"<p>I want to have a Singleton that will be auto instantiated on program start.</p>

<p>What I mean by ""auto instantiated"" is that the code in the Singleton should instantiate itself on program start without any calls or declarations by other code.</p>

<p>Any help is appreciated. Thanks.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>What I'm actually wanting to do with this is...
There would be many of these singleton classes (and more can be added as time goes on), all of which would inherit from a common (abstract) parent class (aka. PClass).</p>

<p>The PClass would have a static member that is a collection of PClasses... and a constructor to add itself to the collection...</p>

<p>Then in theory all the singletons would automagically be added to the collection (since when they are instantiated the base PClass constructor is called and adds the new object to the collection)... then the collection can be used without knowing anything about what child (singleton) classes have been implemented, and new child (singleton) classes can be added any time without having to change any other code.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I can't get the children (singletons) to instantiate themselves... screwing up my little plan, resulting in this post.</p>

<p>Hope I explained that well enough.</p>

","33708","","<p>Pretty much. The important thing to know is that unit testing (in TDD) is not much about testing as it's about design. You create unit test to incorporate design decisions of every single component of code in an automated validation system; so that each part of your system conforms to its design. This way, you can rely on each component is not relying on unspecified features of other components.</p>

"<p>memcmp C implementation - any logical errors with this one?</p>

    printf (""ret_val is = %d"",ret_val);

<p>The definition of memcmp() which the above code snippet should conform to is:</p>

<p>The definition of the ‘C’ Library function memcmp is
int memcmp(const char *cs, const char *ct, size_t n)</p>

<p>Compare the first n characters of cs with the first n characters of ct.

Regardless, I need to use a uniqueidentifier as my primary key, and I do NOT want to use newsequentialid() because the generated values are too similar to one another (I need more random IDs so users can't [reasonably] 'guess' another ID).</p>

<p>So, what is the best way to index this PK? Even though a clustered index on this column is not ideal, is it better than a ""unique, non-clustered"" index?</p>

<p>I'm using SQL Server 2005.</p>
","33708","","<p>First of all, if you are trying to use <code>NEWID()</code> to achieve randomness (more than just looking random), you're in trouble.</p>

<p>It's usually less than ideal choice because other indexes will reference the clustered index key and a long clustered index key will degrade the performance of all indexes. You could create an <code>IDENTITY</code> integer column and make that the clustered index and just create a non-clustered unique index on the <code>uniqueidentifier</code> column.</p>

"<p>We're trying to implement formsAuthentication on our site, but in a scenario that we haven't been able to find a solution for yet - other than creating our own HttpModule and doing the custom logic ourselves - so I thought I'd toss the question out there to see if this was indeed the only solution.</p>

<p>We'd like to use formsAuthentication on top of custom Membership providers, but would like to use a different provider for different folders.  Our site partitions these sections with subfolders (eg: ~/Admin, ~/GoldCustomer, ~/SilverCustomer, ~/BronzeCustomer), so we'd like to use different Membership providers for each section/subfolder.  Using the framework to support this, we'd implement our web.config like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;configuration xmlns=""http://schemas.microsoft.com/.NetConfiguration/v2.0""&gt;
&lt;location path=""Admin""&gt;
&lt;system.web&gt;
  &lt;authentication mode=""Forms""&gt;
    &lt;forms name=""AdminAuth"" loginUrl=""~/AdminLogin.aspx"" /&gt;
  &lt;/authentication&gt;
  &lt;membership defaultProvider=""AdminProvider"" &gt;
    &lt;providers &gt;
      &lt;add connectionStringName=""ConnString"" name=""AdminProvider"" type=""Assembly.AdminMembershipProvider"" ... /&gt;
    &lt;/providers&gt;
  &lt;/membership&gt;
&lt;/system.web&gt;
&lt;/location&gt;
&lt;location path=""GoldCustomer""&gt;
  &lt;system.web&gt;
  &lt;authentication mode=""Forms""&gt;
    &lt;forms name=""GoldCustomerAuth"" loginUrl=""~/GoldCustomerLogin.aspx"" /&gt;
  &lt;/authentication&gt;
  &lt;membership defaultProvider=""GoldCustomerProvider"" &gt;
    &lt;providers &gt;
      &lt;add connectionStringName=""ConnString"" name=""GoldCustomerProvider"" type=""Assembly.GoldCustomerMembershipProvider"" ...="""" /&gt;
    &lt;/providers&gt;
  &lt;/membership&gt;
&lt;/system.web&gt;
&lt;/location&gt;
&lt;system.web&gt;
  &lt;compilation debug=""true"" /&gt;
  &lt;authentication mode=""Forms"" /&gt;
&lt;/system.web&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Doing this though results in the runtime error:</p>

<p>It is an error to use a section registered as allowDefinition='MachineToApplication' beyond application level.  This error can be caused by a virtual directory not being configured as an application in IIS.</p>

<pre><code>Line 11:   &lt;location path=""Admin""&gt;

</code></pre>

<p>It seems that the only way to accomplish what we're trying is with a custom HttpModule - or change our approach (like breaking the folders up into different web apps in IIS).  Is this correct, or am I missing something?  Or are there other alternatives I'm not aware of?</p>

<p>Thanks for your help!</p>
","33708","","<p>First of all, I think role-based security makes perfect sense for your application if you have control over the databases. But if you can't change it, it's a no-go.</p>

<p>The alternative solution can be a gateway login forms that redirects user to folder specific login form based on <code>ReturnUrl</code> querystring variable and that form will use the provider it wants to validate the user. Then it uses the <code>FormsAuthentication.RedirectFromLoginPage</code> to set an authentication cookie and redirect to the previous page. You can set the roles and use role based security to control access to each folder with <code>&lt;authorization&gt;</code> tag in <code>web.config</code>.</p>

"<p>Alright, so let's say I'm writing an application using an object-oriented language, and I have a set of key-value pairs that represent program parameters/configuration/options/settings/etc. These may be initial values of certain variables, or just values that aren't bound to change except between sessions. How should I represent these values in my data model? </p>

<p>My initial thought is to simply store all the values in single class that is globally accessible (singleton perhaps), because these values will be used in various places in the code. This, however, will make all the other classes dependent on this singleton. </p>

<p>Is that a problem in this situation? Is there another, ideal solution that I haven't thought of? How do you people usually represent this type of data? Is there anything else I should be aware of concerning this problem?</p>

","33708","","<p>You might want to use dependency injection. Create an interface <code>IConfigurationProvider</code>. Create a class <code>DefaultConfigurationProvider</code> that implements that interface and does the actual task.

"<p>I have 14 LINQ queries to resolve in one method. None of them have a base query that I could hang them from as subqueries and then store the results as properties of an anonymous type instance.</p>

<p>Rather than making 14 separate calls to the database, how can I ensure that they are all called in the same operation?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>I ended up using a dodgy hack which did the trick. I know that there will ALWAYS be at least one user in the user table, so I ended up using:</p>

<p>I think my approach is redundant and from a pragmatic perspective, should be handled differently, either via a stored procedure or some sort of delayed/mixed approach.</p>
","33708","","<p>I'm not completely sure about your queries but you could encapsulate the query logic in a stored procedure drag it with LINQ to SQL data context designer to use.</p>

<p>Consider a base class which provides a standard set of services and functionalities, as well as some structure around those. By way of metaphor, let's consider the following example class:</p>

","33708","","<p>First of all, the condition should read <code>cardCount == 2</code> but that's not the cause of that error.

","33708","","<p>The evidence can be assembly strong name, code base and other stuff. It certainly can verify those stuff. You manually trust assemblies based on the evidence. Basically, you tell the framework if an assembly has the following properties, grant it that permission set. I don't see a way you could provide false evidence. Can you provide an example?</p>

<p>PS. Yes, you could, for example steal someone's key pair and sign your assembly with that. Like any other security system, it relies on a <em>trust chain</em>. If you break a part of the chain, you've screwed up. There's no real way you could circumvent these stuff in a security system. After all, you could compromise the system with a buffer overflow or something and add your assembly to the full trust list.</p>

"<p>I recently came across a great data structures book,""<a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0131997467"">Data Structures Using C</a>"" (c) 1991, at a local Library book sale for <strong>only $2</strong>. As the book's title implies, the book covers data structures using the C programming language.</p>

<p>I got the book knowing it would be out-dated but would probably contain lots of advanced C topics that I wouldn't encounter elsewhere.</p>

<p>Sure enough within 5 minutes I found something I didn't know about C. I came across a section talking about the <code>union</code> keyword and I realized that I had never used it, nor ever seen any code that does. I was grateful for learning something interesting and quickly bought the book.</p>

<p>For those of you not knowledgeable about what a union is, the book uses a good metaphor to explain:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To fully understand the concept of a
  union, it is necessary to examine its
  implementation. A Structure may be
  regarded as a road map to an area of
  memory. It defines how the memory is
  to be interpreted. A union provides
  several different road maps for the
  same area of memory, and it is the
  responsibility of the programmer to
  determine which road map is in current
  use. In practice, the compiler
  allocates sufficient storage to
  contain the largest member of the
  union. It is the road map, however,
  that determines how that storage is to
  be interpreted.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>I could easily come up with contrived situations or hacks where I would use a Union. (But I am not interested in contrived situations or hacks...)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Have you used or seen an implementation where using Union solved the problem **more elegantly** than not using a Union?</strong></p>

<p>Added bonus if you include a quick explanation of why using union was better/easier than not using a union.</p>

<p>Explanation: I don't really know if it requires further explanation but I'll try. <code>inputList</code> is an array or any other collection providing source words. <code>GroupBy</code> function will group the input collection by some similar property (which is, in my code the object itself, as noted by the lambda <code>word =&gt; word</code>). The output (which is a set of groups by a specified key, the word) will be transformed to an object with <code>Word</code> and <code>Frequency</code> properties and sorted by <code>Frequency</code> property in descending order. You could use <code>.Take(10000)</code> to take the first 10000. The whole thing can be easily parallelized by <code>.AsParallel()</code> provided by PLINQ. The query operator syntax might look clearer:</p>

<p>Follow up: LAPACK is a full featured library for dealing with all kind of linear algebra stuff (and it's damn efficient at this, there are also GPU based libraries, such as CUBLAS which runs on NVIDIA GPUs using CUDA). </p>

<p>If you are dealing with same number of equations than unknowns, you'll be dealing with simple equation solving solution.</p>

<p>Basically, if you have more unknowns than equations, you'll be dealing with something called <em>underdetermined system</em>. Similarly, you might be dealing with systems with more equations than unknowns (<em>overdetermined systems</em>). If you have an underdetermined system, you probably want to look for a <em>minimum norm</em> solution (there can be infinite number of solutions to a single underdetermined system). For overdetermined systems, we might be looking for so called <em>least squares solution</em>.

However to cross check I tried to display the ip-address on a message box which it did correctly.
So what exactly is going wrong??</p>
","33708","","<p>You shouldn't bind a socket to remote host address. It's used to indicate on which inbound IP address you should listen. You should either specify one of your own IP addresses (if you want to listen only on a single IP) or specify <code>IPAddress.Any</code> (0.0.0.0) to listen on all IP addresses you have.</p>

<p>By the way, if you want to connect to a remote address, you shouldn't use <code>Bind</code> at all. You'd just use the <code>Connect</code> method</p>

","33708","","<p><code>Module</code>s are VB counterparts to C# <code>static</code> classes. When your class is designed solely for helper functions and extension methods and you <strong>don't</strong> want to allow <strong>inheritance</strong> and <strong>instantiation</strong>, you use a <code>Module</code>.</p>

It tries to access <code>B.i</code> for the first time which will cause execution of the static constructor of class <code>B</code>. <code>.cctor</code> of <code>B</code> will try to access <code>A.i</code> but since it's not the first time a field is being accessed, static constructor of <code>A</code> will <strong>not</strong> run anymore. It just fetches the current value of <code>A</code> which is still 0. Consequently, <code>B.i</code> will be equal to 1 when <code>B..cctor</code> finishes execution and control is returned to <code>A..cctor</code>.

","33708","","<p>As far as I know (disclaimer: and I'm not an expert here, just what I've heard), <code>gzip</code> uses the same algorithm as <code>deflate</code> but it has more header stuff that make it have a larger size (relative to <code>deflate</code>).

","33708","","<p>The primary reason for its existence is the introduction of anonymous types in C#. You can construct types on the fly that don't have a name. How would you specify their name? The answer: You can't. You just tell the compiler to infer them for you:</p>

","33708","","<p>Your theory is true. COM memory management is based on reference counting. The <code>Release</code> method of <code>IUnknown</code> interface will decrement the reference count and return it. That function will not release <em>references</em>. It doesn't know who holds the reference. It just decrements the reference count until it reaches zero and then the object will be destructed. It's dangerous as others might still hold a reference to it that will become invalid after object's destruction.</p>

","33708","","<p>In C#, you can't do </p>

<p>to check for <code>null</code>s. It's a compile time error (if the class doesn't have an implicit boolean conversion operator).</p>

<pre><code>if (!MyObject)
</code></pre>

<p>is also invalid if the class doesn't overload <code>operator !</code> to return a boolean value (or a value that can be implicitly casted to a boolean). </p>

<p>So you have to stick with <code>obj == null</code> and <code>obj != null</code>.</p>

<p>To summarize, the non-subjective reason is being able to compile your code!</p>

<h3>UPDATE (story):</h3>

<p>Once upon a time, in ancient C, there was no <code>bool</code> type. Zero was considered <code>false</code> and every non-zero value was considered <code>true</code>. You could write </p>

<pre><code>while(1) { }
</code></pre>

<p>to create an infinite loop.<br />
You could also do things like </p>

<pre><code>int n  = 10;
while (n--) { }
</code></pre>

<p>to have a loop that executes <code>n</code> times. The problem with this strategy was:</p>

<pre><code>int x = 10;
if (x = 0) { // bug: meant to be x == 0
}
</code></pre>

<p>You missed a single character and you created a bug (most modern C compilers will issue a warning on this statement, but it's valid C, nevertheless).</p>

<p>This is why you see code like </p>

<pre><code>if (5 == variable) 

if (NULL == pObj)
</code></pre>

<p>in many places as it's not prone to the above mistake.</p>

<p>C# designers decided to <strong>require</strong> a <em>boolean</em> expression as the condition for <code>if</code>, <code>while</code>, etc., and not allow casting of types (unless they explicitly declare an overloaded operator, which is discouraged) to boolean to reduce the chance of errors. So things like:</p>

<pre><code>object x = null;
if (x) { }

int y = 10;
if (y) { }
while (y--) { }
</code></pre>

<p>that are valid in C, <strong>do not compile in C# at all</strong>.<br />
This is not a matter of style or agreement by any means.</p>

"<p>Are there any O(1/n) algorithms?</p>

<p>Or anything else which is less than O(1)? </p>
","33708","","<p>I think the source of the debate is possibly the <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/471199/what-is-the-difference-between-n-and-on/471206#471206"">misconception of Big-Oh and Big-theta notations</a>. </p>

<p>In some answers and comments it was mentioned that a <code>O(1/n)</code> can be considered <code>O(1)</code> as the function is already bounded to some constant. This is true <em>and indeed, it's the nature of Big-Oh notation. You can say QuickSort is O(n<sup>100</sup>) and you are technically correct as it's a <strong>valid upper bound</strong> (which is not very tight in this example)</em>. </p>

<p>As a result, technically, this question is obvious: If anything is less than O(1) <em>(or O(whatever), for that matter)</em>, it would <strong>also</strong> be O(1) <em>(O(<code>&gt;</code> whatever))</em>, by definition.</p>

<p>In regular speech, we mostly use Big-Oh to mean tight bounds (instead of Big-theta, which is the correct notation for it). Basically, the question should not include the ""or anything less than O(1)"" part. <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/905551/are-there-any-o1-n-algorithms/905832#905832"">Konrad's answer</a> is completely right.</p>

<p>These notations are <strong>theoretical concepts</strong>. They don't take one important thing into account that currently limits us in practice: In practice, our machines are <strong>finite</strong> and this is where it seems like a paradox. In a finite machine, our ""<code>n</code>"" <strong>always</strong> has an upper bound. Therefore ""<code>1/n</code>"" will have a lower bound which is a constant. So the algorithm practically looks <code>O(1)</code> in <strong>all finite state machines</strong> but because our <strong>n</strong> can never become big enough.</p>

<hr>

<p>To those who believe that there are no <code>o(1)</code> (small-oh) algorithms in practice (as mentioned in some answers), I can argue that in practice all algorithms that eventually halt are also <code>O(1)</code>. With the similar reasoning mentioned above, because the input itself is always bounded, any function of input will also be bounded (it can be very large, but it still has a constant bound!), so every algorithm is <code>O(1)</code> in finite machines. (Put it differently, pigeonhole principle implies that every deterministic finite state machine with <code>S</code> different states can have at most <code>S</code> transitions before getting back to the original state. So any algorithm that eventually halts, which should not make the machine return to the start state, can have at most <code>S-1</code> state transitions, so every algorithm will be O(1)).</p>

<hr>

<p>As pointed out in the comments, computation, as defined by the Turing machine model, is inherently discrete. <em>That will imply that <code>1/n</code> algorithms cannot exist in a discrete computational model</em>. My point is, when using the asymptotic growth about <em>practical implementation</em> of algorithms, we are already ignoring some limitations (for good reasons). There can be algorithms with decreasing running times (till it reaches a bound, of course) as the input grows (as Konrad said). Similarly, one may skew the use of notation to describe the running time of an implementation of such an algorithm.</p>

"<p>I'm involved in a project where a team of developers is building a very long term infrastructure project to replace an existing 10 year old system. By ""very long term"" I mean it must be operating, supported and maintained for at least 10 years into the future from the point of release. Taking into account ~2 years of development, this means we should at this point choose a technology/language/framework to last at least 12 years. We have full control over the computers running the project, their operating systems, etc. I was the developer of the to-be-replaced 10 year old system, and I'm helping the team build the new one right. </p>

<p>The application has a very complex user interface. The UI is built dynamically from configuration files at start-up, each UI component has dependencies on logic and other UI components, which it must receive in run-time. UI elements themselves are very complex, imagine custom gauges, graphs, knobs etc. </p>

<p>Two choices have already been made in the project, that I do not judge or try to change:</p>

<ol>
<li>It will be a desktop application</li>
<li>It will be developed in C#</li>
</ol>

<p>Now we are at a point of choosing the right framework to make our very flexible UI system ""easy to develop"", i.e. reduce the number of developer bugs by relying on a debugged, already-made framework.</p>

<p>The team examined Microsoft's CAB (Composite UI), which suited its purposes extremely well, however the fact Microsoft discontinued it in 2007 is a huge problem taking into account the long-term aspects of the project (think of a framework bug being discovered in 6 years - who will provide support? - and I know we could fix the code in the CAB itself, but that's something we would like to avoid).</p>

<p>One thing that obviously pops to mind is relying Microsoft's WPF. It seems to be ""the future"" of UI development, however it frightens me when thinking about it long term. My main concern is that the market will not accept it, that 3 years from now Microsoft will discontinue it, and that 6 years from now I will not be able to receive proper support for it.</p>

<p>However I don't really see an alternative, besides writing our own framework. I don't want disrespect any 3rd party framework developers, but for such a long term project I can only use products/frameworks/etc from very well-established vendor. </p>

<p>I would appreciate thoughts on whether choosing WPF is the right call given the above context (and if not - what is the right ""complex UI framework"" for such a long term desktop application project using C# ?).</p>

","33708","","<p>Dereferencing an invalid pointer leads to undefined results per spec. It's not guaranteed to fail. </p>

<p><em>Usually (CPU/OS/compiler/... dependent)</em>, the compiler doesn't really care about it at all. It just gives what's currently at that memory address. For example, in x86 architecture, you just see an error only when the address is in a memory page that's not mapped to your process (or your process doesn't have permission to access that), thus an exception will be thrown by the CPU (protection fault) which the OS would handle appropriately (and probably, making your process fail). A trick is sometimes used to make accessing the address <code>0</code> always cause an access violation: The OS sets the read/write bits of the first page of the address space in the page table to 0 so that any access to that page will always generate an exception.</p>

"<p>The case:</p>

<p>There is a .net application calling unmanaged C code. Used method for this:</p>

    private static extern void RunUnmanaged(string fileName);

    public static void Run(string fileName)
    {

<pre><code>if (openFileDialog.ShowDialog() == DialogResult.OK)
{
    MiracleCreator.Run(openFileDialog.FileName);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem:</p>

<p>After several executions of the code in the Windows Forms application the openFileDialog gets broken with exception: <em>""Attempted to read or write protected memory. This is often an indication that other memory is corrupt.""</em></p>

<p>In searching for solution:</p>

<p>Trying ""more reliable"" use of OpenFileDialog doesn't help. Like this solution (tried to give the link, but ""new users aren't allowed to add hyperlinks"" :) ):</p>

<pre><code>public class Invoker
{
    public OpenFileDialog InvokeDialog;
    private Thread InvokeThread;

"<p>This seems to be pretty straight forward. I need to send email from some ASP.NET applications. I need to do this consistently without strange errors and without CPU utilization going through the roof. I'm not talking about mass emailing, just occasional emails.</p>

<p>System.Net.Mail <em>appears</em> to be horribly broken. The SmtpClient does not issue the Quit command (it may be because Microsoft(R) is not interested in following specifications), therefore a connection is left open. Therefore, if someone tries to email before that connection <strong>finally</strong> closes, you can get errors from the SMTP Server about too many connections open. This is a bug that Microsoft(R) is completely uninterested in fixing. See here:</p>

<p>Also, if you look around some suggest to use this code to solve this problem:</p>

<pre><code>smtpClient.ServicePoint.MaxIdleTime = 1;
smtpClient.ServicePoint.ConnectionLimit = 1;
</code></pre>

<p>Ok, yes that does ""solve"" the problem of connections being left open. However, this consistently, try it on a server if you like, causes the CPU on which the process (in this case w3wp.exe) is running to jump and remain at 100% until your application pool is recycled. For whatever reason, the thread that runs mscorwks.dll!CreateApplicationContext is the culprit.</p>

<p>This has the very nice side effect that if you are running on a web host that frowns on sustained 100% CPU usage, you will get your application pool disabled. So this is not as trivial as some suggest. </p>

<p>So my question is what to do? What I need to do is so simple; however getting those ""too many connections open"" errors is not acceptable and nor is the 100% CPU usage. I don't want to purchase a third party component, not because I'm cheap, but I buy enough components  and MSDN subscription that it seems crazy to have to shell out $100-$300 for simple SMTP functionality.</p>

<p>I read that setting the MaxIdleTime higher can help but I'm skeptical of that. I don't want to risk my app pool being disabled just because Microsoft doesn't want to follow the SMTP specification.</p>

"<p>I'm somewhat new to .NET but not new to programming, and I'm somewhat puzzled at the trend and excitement about disassembling compiled .NET code.  It seems pointless.</p>

<p>The high-level ease of use of .NET is the reason I use it.  I've written C and real (hardware processor) assembly in environments with limited resources.  That was the reason to spend the effort on so many meticulous details, for efficiency.  Up in .NET land, it kind of defeats the purpose of having a high-level object-oriented language if you waste time diving down into the most cryptic details of the implementation.  In the course of working with .NET, I have debugged the usual performance issues an odd race conditions, and I've done it all by reading my own source code, never once having any thought as to what intermediate language the compiler is generating.  For example, it's pretty obvious that a for(;;) loop is going to be faster than a foreach() on an array, considering that foreach() is going to use an enumeration <em>object</em> with a method call to advance to each next time instead of a simple increment of a variable, and this is easy to prove with a tight loop run a few million times (no disassembly required).</p>

<p>What really makes disassembling IL silly is the fact that's it's not <em>real</em> machine code.  It's virtual machine code.  I've heard some people actually like to move instructions around to optimize it.  Are you kidding me?  Just-in-time compiled virtual machine code can't even do a simple tight for(;;) loop at the speed of natively compiled code.  If you want to squeeze every last cycle out of your processor, then use C/C++ and spend time learning real assembly.  That way the time you spend understanding lots of low-level details will actually be worthwhile.</p>

<p>What I'm trying to do though is slightly more complicated (and PredicateBuilder doesn't help here..) in that I want a later IQueryable to basically access the Where conditions that were established prior without having to wrap them to create the Or between them.</p>

<p>As each extension method returns IQueryable&lt;> I understand that it should have the knowledge about the current status of query conditions somewhere, which leads me to believe that there should be some automated way or creating an Or across all prior Where conditions without having to wrap what you want Or'd.</p>

<p>I'm using a generic base class to access a common property (DateTime ""Time"" property on LINQ object <em>Dinner</em> which is also on <em>Lunch</em>). </p>

<p>Both objects are implementing <strong>ITimeable</strong> which exposes the DateTime property.</p>

<p>In my base class I'd like to have a method Select() which works on IQueryable&amp;ltT> and can automatically filter based on the Time property. Because I'm working off the generic T, the time property is not visible to the base class, unless I tell it that T is implementing <strong>ITimeable</strong>.</p>

<p>I do want the same base class to work for other non-ITimeable objects too, that's why I need the interface restriction on the Select method, and I also need it in order to access the Time property using generics.</p>

<p>Hope that clears the goal :)</p>

"<p>How do I generate and return a KML document directly to the browser without writing a temporary file to the server or relying on a 3rd party library or class?</p>
","33708","","<p>I suggest you consider using an HTTP Handler instead of a ASP.NET page. It will be cleaner and more performant. Just add new item of type ""Generic Handler"" to your project and consider moving the code to its <code>ProcessRequest</code> method. The general approach is good, though.</p>

<p>By the way, unless you are explicitly mapping <code>.kml</code> files to an ASP.NET handler, it'll not run anyway. I suggest going with the default <code>.ashx</code> extension and add a <code>Content-Disposition</code> HTTP header to set the filename for the client: </p>

<pre><code>Response.AddHeader(""Content-Disposition"", ""attachment; filename=File.kml"");
</code></pre>

<p>Also, note that you should set header stuff <strong>before</strong> anything is sent to the client so you should move setting <code>Content-Type</code> and adding header before other stuff.</p>

<hr>

<p>Full Solution (From the OP):</p>

<p>Here's how I did it:</p>

<h3>Server</h3>

<ol>
<li>Add the .kml mimetype to the folder where you want this ""file"" to live. Say, <code>\\myDevServer\...\InetPub\KML</code><br>
(<a href=""http://code.google.com/apis/kml/documentation/kml_tut.html#kml_server"" rel=""nofollow"">Google's instructions are only for Apache</a>)
<ol>
<li>Open <code>Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager</code> on your DEV server</li>
<li>Navigate to your DEV site</li>
<li>Right-click the <code>KML</code> folder and choose <code>Properties</code></li>
<li>Click the <code>HTTP Headers</code> tab</li>
<li>Click the <code>MIME types</code> button</li>
<li>Click <code>New</code></li>
<li>Enter
<ul>
<li>Extension: .kml</li>
<li>MIME Type: application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Click <code>OK</code> twice to get back to the <code>HTTP Headers</code> tab</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Set the <code>KML</code> folder as an ASP.NET application (maybe optional depending on how your server is set up)
<ol>
<li>Click the <code>Directory</code> tab</li>
<li>Click the <code>Create</code> button</li>
<li>The <code>Application name</code> field becomes active with the setting <code>KML</code></li>
<li>Click <code>OK</code> taking you back to the main IIS Manager window</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<h3>Website</h3>

<ol>
<li>Open VS2008:
<ol>
<li>File >> New Website</li>
<li>Choose:
<ul>
<li><code>Empty Web Site</code></li>
<li>Language: <code>C#</code></li>
<li>Location: <code>\\myDevServer\...\InetPub\KML\</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
<li>In <code>Solution Explorer</code>
<ol>
<li>Rightclick the website</li>
<li>Choose <code>New Item</code></li>
<li>Choose <code>Generic Handler</code> from the <code>Visual Studio installed templates</code> window</li>
<li>Enter a name (I used <code>MelroseVista.ashx</code> )</li>
<li>Choose Language: <code>Visual C#</code></li>
<li>Click <code>OK</code></li>
</ol></li>
<li>Paste the following code</li>

"<p>In just about any formally structured set of information, you start reading either from the start towards the end, or occasionally from the end towards the beginning (street addresses, for example.)

"<p>I'm reading up on ASP .NET MVC, and I just got to a section talking about the Authorize attribute.  It's saying that the Authorize attribute is used to check that a user is authenticated against a Controller.  Is this true?  I know that the attribute is designed to be used for authorization purposes, but is it also a best practice to use this attribute for authentication?</p>

<p>If not, what is the best practice for <em>verifying</em> (not performing) authentication?</p>

<p>If so, why is it done this way?  Am I missing something?</p>
","33708","","<p><code>Authorize</code> attribute can be used to check to see whether the user is logged in. It can also be used to check if the user is a member of a specific role and has a specific name.</p>

<p>It essentially does the same thing handled by <code>&lt;authorization&gt;</code> section in <code>web.config</code> when using Web forms.</p>

<p>It doesn't specify the authentication method. It's handled by <code>&lt;authentication&gt;</code> section in <code>web.config</code> just like Web forms.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT (clarification about authentication and authorization):</strong></p>

<p>Authentication is <em>identity verification</em>. That is, you check to see who the user is. This can be performed by checking a user name and password, checking your Windows authentication token, scanning retina, voice identification or whatever else.</p>

<p>Authorization is the act of <em>limiting access</em> to a specific resource to users that satisfy a certain criteria. To be able to authorize a user to a resource, you should know the rights the user have. To check that, you should know who the user is in the first place. So the user have to be authenticated.  </p>

<p>Essentially an empty <code>[Authorize]</code> attribute does authorization, not authentication. It doesn't check who you are. It just checks if the one who you verified to be does have access to the resource or not. However, its authorization criteria is ""anyone successfully authenticated."" You can specify a different criteria. So, indeed it's doing authorization, not authentication.</p>

"<pre><code>&lt;%if (CanRemove) Response.Write(""&lt;b&gt;""+ProductName+""&lt;/b&gt;""); %&gt;

<p>This code strikes me as ugly.  More specifically, any time I see a call to Response.Write inside an ascx or aspx file, I get suspicious that I'm doing something wrong.  Perhaps this is due to previously working with XSLT and noticing that when done right, there is rarely a need for <code>&lt;xsl:text&gt;</code> element in order to generate html.  I feel like it interferes with my ability to read the code when my html code is hidden inside a <code>&lt;% %&gt;</code> block.</p>

<p>Is this just something I need to get used to with Asp.Net or is there a better way to do it?</p>
","33708","","<p>An alternative approach is to use a <code>&lt;asp:Literal&gt;</code> control and bind (or manually set) its <code>Visible</code> property to <code>CanRemove</code> and its contents to the specific text.</p>

<p>Whether this approach is better or worse depends on the style the application is developed in. In ASP.NET MVC style apps (or those that heavily modify HTML directly), I think the current method makes more sense. In ASP.NET Web form and server control based apps, the <code>&lt;asp:Literal&gt;</code> solution is more consistent.</p>

"<p>In C# can I cast a variable of type object to a variable of type T where T is defined in a Type variable?</p>
","33708","","<p>Putting boxing and unboxing aside for simplicity, there's no specific runtime action involved in casting along the inheritance hierarchy. It's mostly a compile time thing. Essentially, a cast tells the compiler to treat the value of the variable as another type.</p>

<p>What you could do after the cast? You don't know the type, so you wouldn't be able to call any methods on it. There wouldn't be any special thing you could do. Specifically, it can be useful only if you know the possible types at compile time, cast it manually and handle each case separately with <code>if</code> statements:</p>

<pre><code>if (type == typeof(int)) {
    int x = (int)obj;

","33708","","<p>You can't allocate or initialize a global or static array declaratively using non-constant values (compile-time). It's possible for local arrays though (C99 variable sized arrays, as their initializer essentially runs at runtime every time the function is executed).</p>

"<p>I have a business class that contains two nullable decimal properties. A third property returns the result of multiplying the other two properties.

<li>Return a magic number (-1)</li>

<p>For the record, returning 0 makes the most sense in this case and that's what I plan to do unless someone has a better suggestion.</p>
","33708","","<p>Integral types in .NET use two's complement system for representation. While they could reserve some bit patterns for special values, they chose not to. <code>double</code> and <code>float</code> use a completely different representation system (IEEE 754) which reserves some special bit patterns for NaN, +Infinity, -Infinity, ...</p>

<p>One reason that NaN and Infinity values make more sense for floating point arithmetic is that operations could result division by zero, not only because the divisor is actually zero, but because it's too small to be represented by the type. As a result, if that wasn't the case, you could have some valid calculation mysteriously throw a divide by zero exception. This won't happen for <code>int</code> types as they are exact and don't have a precision error.</p>

<p><code>decimal</code> is designed to be used for ""real-world"" decimal floating point numbers. It's rarely subject to calculations that <code>double</code> and <code>float</code> are designed to do. What would <code>NaN</code> express for a real world number?</p>

<p>Leaving reasons behind it alone, it is what it is and there's nothing we could do about it, so the best route to go is to use nullable types (they are designed to help with exactly this kind of situation). It's the <em>right way</em> to solve this problem. If you don't want to do that (and exceptions don't make sense), you should resort to the magic number solution. If you chose to do so, just make sure it's outside of the domain of valid results.</p>

<h3>EDIT (very common misconception about decimal):</h3>

<p><a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.decimal.aspx"">As also noted by MSDN</a>, <code>decimal</code> is not fixed point. It is a floating point number:</p>

) we are using extensively allows the programming of what it calls 'extensions' using a Component Object Model (COM) interface (actually several interfaces). It provides the MIDL files for these interfaces as well as a 'project template' for Visual C++ as part of an SDK (IDL files, headers and interfaces are already there, only the implementations for the interface functions are missing). To be comaptible, all extensions have to conform to (i.e. must implement) the given COM interface structure.</p>

<p>However, as my familiarity with C++ is rather limited I was hoping to implement the COM in C# and .NET - on the other hand, the pre-defined interfaces make heavy use of pointers and custom data structures, so I'm wondering if I'm not better off implemementing the interfaces in their native C++ rather than trying to recreate everything in C#.</p>

<p>A little more background maybe: the ultimate goal is to control a piece of custom hardware (via USB)  from inside Software A. I have already written a small .NET app wrapping the driver (another third party software) using DLLimport, which was surprisingly painless. In other words, the COM object I am trying to build is essentially a bridge between (third-party) Software A and (third-party) device driver B, which must conform to the interface specifications given by A.</p>

Higher OS layers (e.g. Cocoa Touch), while probably do share some code with their desktop counterpart, are specifically written for the iPhone platform which is significantly different from desktop in terms of screen size, processing power, storage and most importantly, user interface.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>I disagree that UI is a completely different library though. While it's a separate set of APIs (<code>UIKit</code> in iPhone OS and <code>AppKit</code> in Mac OS X), the fundamental ideas are pretty much the same and are coming from their NeXTSTEP heritage. Core Audio is very similar on the surface to its desktop version but I guess the implementation might have some hardware optimizations to better suit iPhone hardware and usage scenarios. Networking is handled at the low level by Darwin which is the same across both OSes and at higher level by Cocoa APIs which is also pretty much identical.</p>

<p>Personally, I think iPhone OS is ""Mobile Leopard"" as much as it made sense. While Windows Embedded CE is more similar to desktop Windows at the API level, the underlying core is very different. In that sense, Mac OS X and iPhone OS are much more similar. However, it didn't make sense to use an identical set of UI APIs for both as their characteristics are very different at that level. They didn't want to sacrifice iPhone UI at any cost. It wasn't supposed to bring a desktop experience to the phone but to create a great experience really suited for such a device. I believe iPhone has succeeded in reaching that goal so Apple has made the correct decision in going with this route ;)</p>

","33708","","<p>Oh, you shouldn't do it in button click event handler.

"<p>I'm having trouble understanding the following bit of code that I was hoping would create an array on the heap and fill it with the characters 9 down to 0 (I know I could just index the array like a normal stack array with [] notation to do this but I'm doing it this way to try to understand pointers in more depth):</p>

<pre><code>int *ptrHeapArray = new int[10];

<p>It prints out compleletly unexpected values.</p>

<p>As I understand the above, the 'new' command creates an array on the heap and sends me back a pointer to the address where the array is. Since the pointer I assign (ptrHeapArray) is of int size I assumed I could use pointer post incrementing to navigate through the array. However the results indicate that my assumptions are wrong.</p>

<p>This got me to thinking that perhaps the pointer passed back by the 'new' keyword is just a pointer to the whole array and can't be used to step through the array for some reason.
So I tried creating another pointer to the pointer returned by the 'new' keyword and used that to do my array population:</p>

<pre><code>int *ptrHeapArray = new int[10];  //array to hold FRANK data in 32 bit chunks
int *ptrToHeapArrayPointer = ptrHeapArray;

for(int f=9; f&gt;=0 ;f--)

	cout &lt;&lt; ptrHeapArray[f]  &lt;&lt; ""\n"";

","33708","","<p>No, they enumerate the collection alike. </p>

<p>If you think of a collection as a set of objects (rows), each with some properties (columns) like a database table. You could filter the results out by removing some rows (<em>vertically</em>) by specifying a condition using <code>Where</code> or remove a set of columns by <code>Select</code>ing a subset of properties (<em>horizontally</em>).</p>

You could have several different custom per user customization modules that would work with anonymous identification. <code>ProfileModule</code> is just one of them (and note that <code>MigrateAnonymous</code> is controlled by <code>ProfileModule</code> and not <code>AnonymousIdentificationModule</code>). So, design-wise, <code>ProfileModule</code> <strong>shouldn't touch the anonymous identification cookie</strong>. <code>AnonymousIdentificationModule</code> could possibly intercept the request at some time and delete the cookie itself if it wanted to but that would <strong>reduce flexibility</strong> and you would have lost data if you haven't migrated it.</p>

","33708","","<p>From your code, it's not clear where your function starts and ends and what it takes as parameters but I <em>guess</em> your problem is with the <code>fitxesJoc</code> variable which is probably passed as an argument to the function. C copies arguments when calling functions (call-by-value). You could pass the address to <code>fitxesJoc</code> variable using a pointer instead and rewrite it as something like this:</p>

<pre><code>// fitxesJoc would be a `tNode**` rather than `tNode*`.
tNode* ultimaFitxa = (tNode *)malloc(sizeof(tNode));
ultimaFitxa-&gt;info.inferior = opcionesCorrectas[opcionFitxa - 1].inferior;

"<p>In Delphi, if there was an exception during construction of an object: any allocated memory would be released and an exception would be thrown.

<pre><code>Camera c = new Camera();
</code></pre>

<p>You <strong>never</strong> had to check the resulting variable for null:</p>

<pre><code>Camera c = new Camera();
if (c == null)
   throw new Exception(""Error constructing Camera"") //waste of time

","33708","","<p>Yes. I'd like to put it this way (as <em>fail</em> might mean <em>logical failure</em> too): If a constructor doesn't throw an exception, the return value is guaranteed to be non-<code>null</code> so you never have to perform such a check.</p>

<p>Creating structures (e.g. Rectangle): A <code>struct</code> can't be <code>null</code> at all (<code>Nullable</code> types are considered completely different types, i.e. <code>typeof(int?) != typeof(int)</code>). Calling a constructor for a structure would either fail by throwing an exception or return an instance.</p>

<p>Getting a member of an enumeration: An <code>enum</code> is a just a set of constants. There's nothing like ""getting a member at runtime."" It's substituted at compile time.</p>

<p>The result of <code>Object.ToString()</code>: Like any method, it can return any valid value for <code>string</code> type which includes <code>null</code> and could also throw an exception (in which case, it doesn't return a value at all).</p>

<p>Mathematical operations: All expressions will return a value or throw an exception. The return value can be any valid value for that type (e.g. <code>Int32</code> can never be <code>null</code>).</p>

","33708","","<p>IIS7 uses its own configuration file located at <code>%windir%\System32\inetsrv\config\applicationHost.config</code>.

I believe those are still read from <code>machine.config</code> and <code>web.config</code> files. Indeed, the default value (specified in <code>machine.config</code>) for <code>requiresQuestionAndAnswer</code> for the <code>AspNetSqlMembershipProvider</code> is <code>true</code> on my machine.</p>

<p>Under a 64 bit OS, a .NET application can either run on a 32 bit CLR in WOW64 mode or natively run under x64 mode. Each .NET framework instance has its own set of config files and ignores all other configuration files. </p>

<p>IIS7 on a 64 bit OS runs applications in 64 bit mode by default. You can, however, set an application pool to run as a 32 bit WOW64 process (<code>enable32BitAppOnWin64</code>, which you can set in Advanced Settings dialog for an application pool in IIS7 manager). If you do that, obviously it'll use settings from 32 bit <code>machine.config</code>. The reason VS Web server uses 32 bit <code>machine.config</code> is exactly this: it runs as a WOW64 process.</p>

"<p>It's hard enough to find reliable numbers as to general adoption of the .NET framework. This questions concerns an even more specific case: what's the situation among home users?</p>

<p>I am wondering wether .NET is a good choice for a desktop application when targetting home users?</p>

"<p>This seems to be a trivial question but I got hung on it for a few hours now (maybe too much Java killed my C++ braincells).</p>

<p>I have created a class that has the following constructor (i.e. no default constructor)</p>

<pre><code>VACaptureSource::VACaptureSource( std::string inputType, std::string inputLocation ) {
    if( type == """" || location == """" ) {
	throw std::invalid_argument(""Empty type or location in VACaptureSource()"");
}
type = inputType;
location = inputLocation;

// Open the given media source using the appropriate OpenCV function.
if( type.compare(""image"") ) {
	frame = cvLoadImage( location.c_str() );
	if( !frame ) {
		throw std::runtime_error(""error opening file"");
	}
}
else {
	throw std::invalid_argument(""Unknown input type in VACaptureSource()"");
}
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>When I want to create an instance, I use </p>

<pre><code>    // Create input data object
try {
	VACaptureSource input = VACaptureSource(""image"", ""/home/cuneyt/workspace/testmedia/face_images/jhumpa_1.jpg"");
}
catch( invalid_argument&amp; ia ) {
	cerr &lt;&lt; ""FD Error: "" &lt;&lt; ia.what() &lt;&lt; endl;

}
catch( runtime_error&amp; re ) {
	cerr &lt;&lt; ""FD Error: "" &lt;&lt; re.what() &lt;&lt; endl;
	usage(argv[0]);
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, in this case the instance is local to this block and I can't refer to it anywhere else. On the other hand, I can't say</p>

<pre><code>VACAptureSource input;
</code></pre>

<p>at the beginning of the program since there's no default constructor. </p>

<p>What is the correct way to do this?</p>

","33708","","<p>A local variable is scoped to the block in which it's allocated (like Java) but it'll destruct as soon as the block ends (unlike Java) so you should either do all the stuff you want in the try block itself (which might not be desirable if you want to only handle constructor exceptions) or you should allocate the object somewhere else (e.g. heap) and use a pointer in the parent block to access it.</p>

"<p>I'm currently doing a project in C# working with windows forms.  During the course of it, I did the following</p>

<pre><code>        void HideButtons(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        Button hider = ((Button)sender);
        foreach(Button tohide in hider.Parent.Controls)
            tohide.Hide();
        hider.Show();
        hider.Text = ""UnHide"";
        hider.Click -= new EventHandler(HideButtons);
        hider.Click += new EventHandler(ShowButtons); 
    }
</code></pre>

<p>The purpose of this code is to have a button which hides all the other buttons in the container it's in except itself, and then turn into an Unhide button which does the same thing in reverse.</p>

<p>Now, that's all well and good, except, as I compile this, I realize to myself I've hit a problem.  hider is its unique object, being the return from ((Button)sender).  It's not necessarily the reference to sender, and this code will probably do nothing.</p>

<p>But low and behold, it works exactly like I wanted it to and initially thought it would.  Which got me to wondering, does a cast always return a reference to the original object?  If not, how do I guarantee that (button)sender = sender?</p>

<p>I know that's not the case for doubles/ints, as</p>

<pre><code>        public static int Main()
    {
        int a;
        double b;
        b = 10.5;
        a = (int)b;
        a++;
        return 0;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>ends up with a being 11, and b being 10.5   But that may be due to doubles/ints being structs.  This behavior worries me, and it'd be nice to know that it will always return a reference so I can put my worrysome mind to rest.</p>
","33708","","<p>For <strong>reference types</strong> casted through the inheritance hierarchy, it'll always reference the same instance. However, for value types, casts might involve boxing and unboxing which will copy stuff. Other than that, casts are not just in the inheritance hierarchy. You can declare your own cast operator which has the characteristics of a method. It can return whatever object it likes.</p>

"<p>I've got a process which attempts to decode different encodings of strings from a binary stream.  I get some behavior which does not quite add up in my mind when I step through it.  Specifically, what I do is:</p>

<li>grab the amount of bytes from the stream</li>
<li>use <code>Encoding.GetCharCount</code> to determine just how many characters might have been encoded in those bytes (could be 0 one or two...)</li>
<li>if its not zero i use <code>Encoding.GetString</code> to grab the characters out of the byte array</li>
<li>i then figure out how many bytes were used to encode the extracted characters and advance the stream index by that amount</li>
<li>if the number of decodable bytes turns out to be zero i advance the index by one byte and try the whole thing again...in this fashion i expect not to miss any decodable characters</li>
</ul>

<p><em>BTW, if anyone notices any incorrect assumption made in the above, feel free to say so...</em></p>

<p>I have my decoders set to throw <code>DedcoderFallbackExceptions</code> when they cannot decode a given set of bytes.  What confuses me is that some times the exception arises when I call <code>GetCharCount</code> and other times it occurs when I call <code>GetString</code>.  Is there any reason this should be happening?  Is this in fact expected?

<p><strong>BIG UPDATE:</strong>
It seems that my initial description of the problem is lacking a bit.  Let me add a few more premises to the problem:</p>

<ul>
<li>the stream could be <strong><em>extremely</em></strong> large - it <strong><em>will not</em></strong> fit in memory for most users</li>
<li>at any given place in the stream i don't know for sure that I am at the beginning of text, in the middle of text</li>
<li>at any given place in the stream i don't know if i am in the middle or beginning of a multi byte character</li>
<li>the stream will contain much material that is in fact not text of any sort, as well as a smattering of different encodings</li>
</ul>

<p>Hopefully this clarifies some of the issues.  Responses so far have been very helpful!  Please do continue!</p>
","33708","","<p>Encodings like UTF8 use variable number of bytes for characters so you can't simply multiply the maximum number of bytes to fetch from the stream. The last byte might fall at the middle of a character (and might be invalid in isolation) or the last character might represent a completely different character on that specific encoding.</p>

"<p>What is the difference, if there is one, between a destructor and a Finalize method in a class?</p>

<p>I recently discovered that Visual Studio 2008 considers a destructor synonymous with a Finalize method, meaning that Visual Studio won't let you simultaneously define both methods in a class.</p>

<p>For example, the following code fragment:</p>

<pre><code>class TestFinalize
{
    ~TestFinalize()
    {
        Finalize();
    }

    public bool Finalize()
    {
        return true;
    }
}

<p>Gives the following error on the call to Finalize in the destructor: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The call is ambiguous between the following methods or properties:
          'TestFinalize.~TestFinalize()' and 'TestFinalize.Finalize()'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And if the call to Finalize is commented out, it gives the following error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Type 'ManagementConcepts.Service.TestFinalize' already defines a member called 
      'Finalize' with the same parameter types</p>
</blockquote>
","33708","","<p>A destructor in C# overrides <code>System.Object.Finalize</code> method. You <strong>have to</strong> use destructor syntax to do so. Manually overriding <code>Finalize</code> will give you an error message. </p>

<p>Basically what you trying to do with your <code>Finalize</code> method declaration is <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa691135%28VS.71%29.aspx""><strong>hiding</strong></a> the method of the base class. It will cause the compiler to issue a warning which can be silenced using the <code>new</code> modifier (if it was going to work). The important thing to note here is that you <strong>can't</strong> both <code>override</code> and declare a <code>new</code> member with identical name at the same time so having both a destructor and a <code>Finalize</code> method will result in an error (but you <strong>can</strong>, although not recommended, declare a <code>public new void Finalize()</code> method if you're not declaring a destructor).</p>

</code></pre>

<p>but if I remove the IWorkItemControl it compiles fine.</p>

<p>Why am I getting this error and what is the difference of having / not having the interface name in the signature?</p>
","33708","","<p><a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms173157.aspx"">Explicit interface implementation</a> does not let you specify any access modifiers. When you implement an interface member explicitly (by specifying the interface name before the member name), you can access that member <strong>only using that interface</strong>. Basically, if you do:</p>

<pre><code>System.Collections.Specialized.StringDictionary IWorkItemControl.Properties
{
    get { return properties; }
    set { properties = value; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can't do:</p>

<pre><code>MyClass x = new MyClass();
var test = x.Properties; // fails to compile
// You should do:
var test = ((IWorkItemControl)x).Properties; // accessible through the interface
</code></pre>

<p>There are several use cases for EII. For example, you want to provide a <code>Close</code> method for your class to free up acquired resources but you still want to implement <code>IDisposable</code>. You could do:</p>

<pre><code>class Test : IDisposable {
    public void Close() {
        // Frees up resources
    }
    void IDisposable.Dispose() {
        Close();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This way, the consumers of class can only call <code>Close</code> directly (and they won't even see <code>Dispose</code> in Intellisense list) but you can still use the <code>Test</code> class wherever an <code>IDisposable</code> is expected (e.g. in a <code>using</code> statement).</p>

<p>Another use case for EII is providing different implementations of an identically named interface member for two interfaces:</p>

<pre><code>interface IOne {
   bool Property { get; }
}

interface ITwo {
   string Property { get; }
}

class Test : IOne, ITwo {
   bool IOne.Property { ... }
   string ITwo.Property { ... }
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you see, without EII it's <strong>not even possible</strong> to implement both interfaces of this example in a single class (as the properties differ just in return type). In other cases, you might want to intentionally provide different behavior for individual views of a class through different interfaces.</p>

"<p>I have the very common problem of creating an index for an in-disk array of strings. In short, I need to store the position of each string in the in-disk representation. For example, a very naive solution would be an index array as follows:</p>

<p>Which says that the first string is at position 0, the second at position 20, the third at position 500 and the nth at position 103434.</p>

<p>The positions are always non-negative 64 bits integers in sequential order. Although the numbers could vary by any difference, in practice I expect the typical difference to be inside the range from 2^8 to 2^20. I expect this index to be mmap'ed in memory, and the positions will be accessed randomly (assume uniform distribution).</p>

<p>I was thinking about writing my own code for doing some sort of block delta encoding or other more sophisticated encoding, but there are so many different trade-offs between encoding/decoding speed and space that I would rather get a working library as a starting point and maybe even settle for something without any customizations.</p>

<p>Any hints? A c library would be ideal, but a c++ one would also allow me to run some initial benchmarks.</p>

<p>A few more details if you are still following. This will be used to build a library similar to cdb (<a href=""http://cr.yp.to/cdb/cdbmake.html"">http://cr.yp.to/cdb/cdbmake.html</a>) on top the library cmph (<a href=""http://cmph.sf.net"">http://cmph.sf.net</a>). In short, it is for a large disk based read only associative map with a small index in memory.</p>

<p>Since it is a library, I don't have control over input, but the typical use case that I want to optimize have millions of hundreds of values, average value size in the few kilobytes ranges and maximum value at 2^31.</p>

<p>For the record, if I don't find a library ready to use I intend to implement delta encoding in blocks of 64 integers with the initial bytes specifying the block offset so far. The blocks themselves would be indexed with a tree, giving me O(log (n/64)) access time. There are way too many other options and I would prefer to not discuss them. I am really looking forward ready to use code rather than ideas on how to implement the encoding. I will be glad to share with everyone what I did once I have it working.</p>

"<p>What is the difference between boxing/unboxing and type casting?</p>

<p>Often, the terms seem to be used interchangeably.</p>
","33708","","<p>Boxing and unboxing is a subset of type casts. Boxing is the act of treating a value type as reference type (which in practice, involves copying the contents of that value type (from stack) to the heap and returning a reference to that object). This allows a value type to be passed wherever a compatible reference type is expected. It also allows virtual method calls and other features of reference types to be performed on the value type. Unboxing is the reverse of this operation (getting back a value type out of a boxed object).</p>

<p>Type cast is the term used for <em>any</em> type of conversion from a variable of specific type to another. It's a broader concept. </p>

<p>A few minutes ago <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1085097/1085105#1085105"">I answered a related question that covers this difference</a>. To summarize, I categorized different types of IL instructions generated by C# cast operator:</p>

"<p>All of the examples I've seen of using <code>yield return x;</code> inside a C# method could be done in the same way by just returning the whole list. In those cases, is there any benefit or advantage in using the <code>yield return</code> syntax vs. returning the list?</p>

<p>Also, in what types of scenarios would <code>yield return</code> be used that you couldn't just return the complete list?</p>
","33708","","<p>But what if you were building a collection yourself?</p>

<p>In general, iterators can be used to <strong>lazily generate a sequence of objects</strong>. For example <code>Enumerable.Range</code> method does not have any kind of collection internally. It just generates the next number <strong>on demand</strong>. There are many uses to this lazy sequence generation using a state machine. Most of them are covered under <strong>functional programming concepts</strong>.</p>

<p>In my opinion, if you are looking at iterators just as a way to enumerate through a collection (it's just one of the simplest use cases), you're going the wrong way. As I said, iterators are means for returning sequences. The sequence might even be <strong>infinite</strong>. There would be no way to return a list with infinite length and use the first 100 items. It <strong>has</strong> to be lazy sometimes. <strong>Returning a collection is considerably different from returning a collection generator</strong> (which is what an iterator is). It's comparing apples to oranges.</p>

<p>Hypothetical example:</p>

<pre><code>static IEnumerable&lt;int&gt; GetPrimeNumbers() {
   for (int num = 2; ; ++num) 
       if (IsPrime(num))
           yield return num;
}

static void Main() { 
   foreach (var i in GetPrimeNumbers()) 
       if (i &lt; 10000)
           Console.WriteLine(i);
       else
           break;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This example prints prime numbers less than 10000. You can easily change it to print numbers less than a million without touching the prime number generation algorithm at all. In this example, you can't return a list of all prime numbers because the sequence is infinite and the consumer doesn't even know how many items it wants from the start.</p>

","33708","","<p>Because <code>IRepository</code> is an <code>IRepository&lt;MyObject&gt;</code> and not the other way around.</p>

"<p>I am trying to figure out when and why to use a Dictionary or a HashTable.  I have done a bit of a search on here and have found people talking about the generic advantages of the Dictionary which I totally agree with, which leads the boxing and unboxing advantage for a slight performance gain.</p>

<p>But I have also read the Dictionary will not always return the objects in the order they are inserted, thing it is sorted.  Where as a HashTable will.  As I understand it this leads to the HashTable being far faster for some situations.</p>

<p>My question is really, what might those situations be?  Am I just wrong in my assumptions above?  What situations might you use to choose one above the other, (yes the last one is a bit ambiguous).</p>
","33708","","<p><code>System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary&lt;TKey, TValue&gt;</code> and <code>System.Collections.Hashtable</code> classes both maintain a hash table data structure internally. <strong>None of them guarantee preserving the order of items.</strong> </p>

<p>Leaving boxing/unboxing issues aside, most of the time, they should have very similar performance. </p>

<p>The primary structural difference between them is that <code>Dictionary</code> relies on <em>chaining</em> (maintaining a list of items for each hash table bucket) to resolve collisions whereas <code>Hashtable</code> uses <em>rehashing</em> for collision resolution (when a collision occurs, tries another hash function to map the key to a bucket).</p>

"<p>When calling the Skip() method with a starting index other than 0, the method automatically appends additional columns 'in addition to' the existing order-by column.  These additional order-by columns consist of the remaining columns that are not in the sort expression.  Great job for LINQ to handle this automatically for us as it provides deterministic sorting on the data returned;however, when 0 is passed to the Skip() method (when querying for the first page for instance), it appears that the method is optimized and the additional order-by columns aforementioned is not rendered.  This is problematic as the sort condition is inconsistent between Skip(0) and Skip(n).</p>

Notice how the query generated by Skip(10) append additional ordering for the remaining columns which causes a different data ordering when there are records with the same RequestReceivedDate.  The idea of appending these extra sorting is great; however, the library should implement the same logic for Skip(0) so both Skip(0) and Skip(n) would return data in the same order. </p>

var result = (from a in new DataContext().Persons

</code></pre>

<p>You can freely swap <code>var</code> with <code>List&lt;PersonInformation&gt;</code> here without affecting anything (as this is what the <strong>compiler</strong> does).</p>

<p>Otherwise, if you are working locally with the query, I suggest considering an anonymous type:</p>

<pre><code>var result = (from a in new DataContext().Persons
              where a.Age &gt; 18
              select new { a.Name, a.Age }).ToList();
</code></pre>

<p>Note that <strong>in all of these cases</strong>, the <code>result</code> is <strong>statically typed</strong> (it's type is known at compile time). The latter type is a <code>List</code> of a compiler generated anonymous class similar to the <code>PersonInformation</code> class I wrote above. As of C# 3.0, there's no dynamic typing in the language.</p>

<h2>UPDATE:</h2>

<p>If you really want to return a <code>List&lt;Person&gt;</code> (which might or might not be the best thing to do), you can do this:</p>

<pre><code>var result = from a in new DataContext().Persons
             where a.Age &gt; 18
             select new { a.Name, a.Age };

List&lt;Person&gt; list = result.AsEnumerable()
                          .Select(o =&gt; new Person {
                                           Name = o.Name, 
                                           Age = o.Age
                          }).ToList();

"<p>I've read through previous topics on closures on stackflow and other sources and one thing is still confusing me.  From what I've been able to piece together technically a closure is simply the set of data containing the code of a function and the value of <strong>bound variables</strong> in that function.</p>

<p>In other words technically the following C function should be a closure from my understanding:</p>

<pre><code>int count()
{
    static int x = 0;

    return x++;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Yet everything I read seems to imply closures must somehow involve passing functions as first class objects.   In addition it usually seems to be implied that closures are not part of procedural programming.  Is this a case of a solution being overly associated with the problem it solves or am I misunderstanding the exact definition?</p>
","33708","","<p>For the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure%5F%28computer%5Fscience%29"">exact definition, I suggest looking at its Wikipedia entry</a>. It's especially good. I just want to clarify it with an example.</p>

<p>Assume this C# code snippet (that's supposed to perform an <code>AND</code> search in a list):</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;string&gt; list = new List&lt;string&gt; { ""hello world"", ""goodbye world"" };
IEnumerable&lt;string&gt; filteredList = list;
var keywords = new [] { ""hello"", ""world"" };
foreach (var keyword in keywords)
    filteredList = filteredList.Where(item =&gt; item.Contains(keyword));

foreach (var s in filteredList)  // closure is called here
    Console.WriteLine(s);
</code></pre>

<p>It's a common pitfall in C# to do something like that. If you look at the lambda expression inside <code>Where</code>, you'll see that it defines a function that it's behavior depends on the value of a variable at its definition site. It's like passing a <em>variable itself</em> to the function, rather than the <em>value of that variable</em>. Effectively, when this closure is called, it retrieves the value of <code>keyword</code> variable at that time. The result of this sample is very interesting. It prints out <strong>both</strong> ""hello world"" and ""goodbye world"", which is not what we wanted. What happened? As I said above, the function we declared with the lambda expression is <strong>a closure over <code>keyword</code> <em>variable</em></strong> so this is what happens:</p>

<pre><code>filteredList = filteredList.Where(item =&gt; item.Contains(keyword))
                           .Where(item =&gt; item.Contains(keyword));
</code></pre>

<p>and at the time of closure execution, <code>keyword</code> has the value ""world,"" so we're basically filtering the list a couple times with the same keyword. The solution is:</p>

<pre><code>foreach (var keyword in keywords) {
    var temporaryVariable = keyword;
    filteredList = filteredList.Where(item =&gt; item.Contains(temporaryVariable));
}
</code></pre>

<p>Since <code>temporaryVariable</code> is scoped to the <strong>body</strong> of the <code>foreach</code> loop, in every iteration, it is a different variable. In effect, each closure will bind to a distinct variable (those are different instances of <code>temporaryVariable</code> at each iteration). This time, it'll give the correct results (""hello world""):</p>

<pre><code>filteredList = filteredList.Where(item =&gt; item.Contains(temporaryVariable_1))
                           .Where(item =&gt; item.Contains(temporaryVariable_2));
</code></pre>

<p>in which <code>temporaryVariable_1</code> has the value of ""hello"" and <code>temporaryVariable_2</code> has the value ""world"" at the time of closure execution. </p>

<p>Note that the closures have caused an extension to the lifetime of variables (their life were supposed to end after each iteration of the loop). This is also an important side effect of closures. </p>
"
"<p>I was trying to create an extension that could slice any array-like class (since slicing is oddly absent in the standard libraries). For example:</p>

<pre><code>public static M Slice&lt;M,T&gt;(this M source, int start, int end) where M : IList&lt;T&gt;
{
    //slice code
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, the compiled does not attach this method to objects of type M (even though its error message claims that that is what it is looking for). It seems rather to be dependent upon the type parameters of the method itself, e.g.  in some manner, but I don't fully understand how things are working.</p>

<p>(yes, one could easily write an example that just works with List, but I'm curious if this is even possible.)</p>
","33708","","<p>There compiler does not infer the type <code>T</code> automatically for these cases. Even if it wasn't an extension method, you still had to specify the type parameters manually.</p>

<p>For example what if the class was declared as:</p>

<pre><code>class MyNastyClass : IList&lt;int&gt;, IList&lt;double&gt; {
}
</code></pre>

<p>What would you expect <code>T</code> to be? <code>int</code> or <code>double</code>? As a result, you'll always have to manually call it with the specific parameters:</p>

<pre><code>Slice(myList, 0, 10); // compile-time error, T cannot be inferred.
Slice&lt;IList&lt;int&gt;, int&gt;(myList, 0, 10); // works.
</code></pre>

<p>The workaround is to remove the type parameter <code>T</code> (no constraints needed here):</p>

<pre><code>public static void Slice&lt;M&gt;(this IList&lt;M&gt; source, int start, int end)
</code></pre>

<p>By the way, note that, this is by no means related to the number of parameters. You can have as many type parameters as you like, as long as the compiler can infer them (according to C# specification generic type inference rules). For example, this extension method can be called without specifying type arguments:</p>

<pre><code>public static void SomeMethod&lt;T,U&gt;(this IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; collection, U anotherParameter)

"<p>I have a class that currently has several methods that take integer parameters. These integers map to operations that the application can perform. I'd like to make the class generic so that the consumers of the class can provide an enum type that they have with all the operations in it, then the methods will take parameters of that enum type. However, I want them to be able to not specify a generic type at all, and have it default back to integers with no change in syntax from the current way. Is this possible?</p>

Nothing guarantees that the sequence doesn't change in different enumerations so methods that are doing it multiple times can be dangerous (and inefficient, depending on the nature of the sequence).

"<p>I'm setting up my site to receive info from people via text message. The way it works is they text a number, that service then sends an HTTP POST to a url I specify.

However, I don't really understand how to get a .asmx file running, and can you even call it with a POST, ie, www.mysite.com/webservice.asmx?

<p>Thanks for your insight!</p>
","33708","","<p>While any extension can be mapped to any handler in ASP.NET, by default <code>.aspx</code> is mapped to page handler and <code>.asmx</code> is mapped to Web service handler. I think you are looking for <code>.ashx</code> which represents a generic simple handler. You just need to implement <code>ProcessRequest</code> method of the <code>IHttpHandler</code> interface after adding one to your project (Add New Item <code>-&gt;</code> Generic Handler).</p>

<p>The <code>.ashx</code> works well if you want to manually process the request. Only if you want to provide a Web service (e.g. SOAP), you should go with <code>.asmx</code>. As a consequence, the best solution depends on the format of the HTTP POST request they send. If they send raw data in POST with their own specific protocol, go with <code>.ashx</code>. Otherwise, if they are using a standard RPC (SOAP, XML-RPC, ...) protocol, <code>.asmx</code> is probably better.</p>

He used the <code>BinaryFormatter</code> class to ""unparse"" the byte data I was sending to him. This did not work and he obviously had <em>exceptional</em>... exceptions. <code>Binaryformatter</code> could not ""unparse"" the data correctly since my data was simply a byte array.</p>

<p>What is the use therefore of <code>BinaryFormatter</code> and should I look at using it in each scenario wherever I need to send bytes over the wire?</p>
","33708","","<p>Definitely, if you have your data as <code>byte[]</code>, <code>BinaryFormatter</code> is not a wise thing to use. You just write the data out to the wire. However, if you have a set of objects and want to serialize them to a stream, <code>BinaryFormatter</code> is much easier to use than manually writing each field of each type by hand. The purpose of <code>BinaryFormatter</code> or any serializer/deserializer scheme in general is to provide a way to persist an object graph (possibly complex) as a sequence of bytes.</p>

"<p>So I have an std::set which needs to keep specific ordering as well as not allowing duplicates of a user defined (by me) type. Now I can get the order to work correctly by overloading the '&lt;' operator in my type. However, the set does not appropriately detect duplicates, and to be honest I'm not entirely sure how it does this internally. I have overloaded the '==' operator, but somehow im not sure this is what the set is actually using? So the question is how does the set determine duplicates when you add values? Here is the relevant code:</p>

<p>The user defined type:</p>

<pre><code>//! An element used in the route calculation.
struct RouteElem {
    int shortestToHere; // Shortest distance from the start.
    int heuristic;		// The heuristic estimate to the goal.

<p>So the elements are equivalent when their position is equivalent, and an element is less than another if its combined functional is less than that of the other. The sorting works, but the set will accept two elements of the same position.</p>
","33708","","<p><code>std::set</code> supports specifying a comparison function. The default is <code>less</code> which will use <code>operator &lt;</code> to check equality. You can define a custom function to check equality and use that one instead:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>Note that it's not possible to separate the comparison function from sorting function. <code>std::set</code> is a binary tree and if an element in a binary tree is not bigger nor smaller than a specific element, it should be in the same place. It does something like this in the place finding algorithm:</p>

<pre><code>if (a &lt; b) {

"<p>hey guys, <br />
Lately, I'v been struggling with an annoying situation on ASP.NET MVC. Here's the story in short, <br />
I'm supposed to have a view that lists all of the products; now because those products are too many, I'm paging them (very innovative heh!). The page contains two paging arrows -""Next 10 products"", ""and previous 10 products"". The view is passed a <code>IEnumerable&lt;Product&gt;</code> collection containing the list of products to be displayed. The view is also passed two integers (currentPage, totalPages) as ViewData items. Now what I need to accomplish is to check if it's the first page (ViewData[""CurrentPage""] == 0) I should change the css class of the ""previous 10 pages"" link to disabled, so I came up with something like the following <br />  <br />           </p>

<pre><code> &lt;a href=""/Products/Page&lt;%=Html.Encode(Convert.ToInt32(ViewData[""CurrentPage""])-1)%&gt;/"" 
           class=""&lt;%=Convert.ToInt32(ViewData[""CurrentPage""]) &lt;= 1 ? ""bgn disabled"" : """"%&gt;""&gt;                          
                previous 10 products                
        &lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This worked fine, still there's a problem. Though the link is disabled, or specifically grayed, it still points to a valid URL, so I tried to actually change the href attribute of the link based on the CurrentPage variable. Here's how the code looks like (get ready to the pure ugliness): <br /><br /></p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href=""&lt;%=Convert.ToInt32(ViewData[""CurrentPage""]) &lt;= 0 ? 
        ""javascript:void[]"" : 
        ""/products/Page&lt;%=Html.Encode(Convert.ToInt32(ViewData[""CurrentPage""])+1)%&gt;/"" %&gt;"" 
        class=""&lt;%=Convert.ToInt32(ViewData[""CurrentPage""]) &lt;= 0 ? 
        ""bgn disabled"" :
        """"%&gt;""&gt;

    previous 10 products
    &lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now, my problems with this code are: <br /></p>

<ol>
<li>The second statement doesn't work, apparently because of the nested server side scripts</li>
<li>It's very ugly, and absolutely unreadable (imagine I'm doing this with each page that requires paging! pain in the but). :( </li>
</ol>

<p>Any better alternatives guys?</p>
","33708","","<p>You can use an <code>if</code> statement:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;% if (Convert.ToInt32(ViewData[""CurrentPage""]) &lt;= 0) { %&gt;

&lt;% } else { %&gt; 
     Link template goes here...

"<p>I want to implement architecture involving different .NET assemblies (i.e. modules). Some of these modules should provide services which are used as .NET interfaces by other modules.
The modules should be loaded and registered dynamically at runtime, I do not want to have ""hardcoded"" dependencies between them.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre>
  Module1.dll:
    Defines a class implementing interface IService1
  Module2.dll:
    Uses the class provided by Module1 through the interface IService1 
</pre>

<p>The problem is where to put the definition of <code>IService1</code>: Both modules need this definition. But since <code>Module2</code> should also work in absence of <code>Module1</code> (the availability of the service is checked at runtime) I don't want <code>Module2.dll</code>  to reference <code>Module1.dll</code> directly.</p>

<p>One possibility is to split every module into two assemblies (interface and definition), but that would mean that I double the number of DLLs which I do not want.</p>

<p>I thought also of using a separate ""Interface Dll"" i.e. one single assembly containing all interface definitions, but then again, if I change one single interface or if I add new modules (with new iterfaces), I need to update this central DLL and therefore all other modules (since they all depend on it...)</p>

<p>What I would like is to link the interface definition into both <code>Module1</code> and <code>Module2</code>, but I do not know if resp. how this is possible.</p>

<p>I'd appreciate any ideas</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>
Perhaps the example was a bit too simple: There could be a scenario where <code>Module1a.dll</code>, <code>Module1b.dll</code> etc. provide implementations for <code>IService</code> and <code>Module2a.dll</code>, <code>Module2b.dll</code> etc. are using them...</p>
","33708","","<p><code>Module2.dll</code> should declare <code>IService</code> and <code>Module1.dll</code> should reference <code>Module2.dll</code>.

","33708","","<p>I think the <code>Lines</code> property is recalculated every time you want to access it.

"<p>I have question regarding the use of function parameters.</p>

<p>In the past I have always written my code such that all information needed by a function is passed in as a parameter. I.e. global parameters are not used.</p>

<p>However through looking over other peoples code, functions without parameters seem to be the norm. I should note that these are for private functions of a class and that the values that would have been passed in as paramaters are in fact private member variables for that class.</p>

<p>This leads to neater looking code and im starting to lean towards this for private functions but would like other peoples views.</p>

<p>E.g.  </p>

<pre><code>Start();  
Process();  
Stop();

","33708","","<p>As you mentioned, there's a trade-off between them. There's no hard rule for always preferring one to another. Minimizing the scope of variables will keep their side effect local, the code more modular and reusable and debugging easier. However, it can be an overkill in some cases. If you keep your classes small (which you should do) then the shared variable would generally make sense. However, there can be other issues such as thread safety that might affect your choice.</p>

As I understand it, this would still avoid the pitfalls of static classes, such as not being able to implement generic functionality via interfaces, but still offer the ease of single line calls to the repository object?</p>

"<p>I have an abstract class in a library. I'm trying to make it as easy as possible to properly implement a derivation of this class. The trouble is that I need to initialize the object in a three-step process: grab a file, do a few intermediate steps, and then work with the file. The first and last step are particular to the derived class. Here's a stripped-down example.</p>

<pre><code>abstract class Base
{
    // grabs a resource file specified by the implementing class
    protected abstract void InitilaizationStep1();

    // performs some simple-but-subtle boilerplate stuff

<p>I feel like either way there is a serious and non-obvious ""gotcha"" that future users of the library will have to work around. Is there some other design I should be using to achieve this kind of initialization?</p>

<p>I can provide more details if necessary; I was just trying to provide the simplest example that expressed the problem.</p>
","33708","","<p>In lots of cases, initialization stuff involves assigning some properties. It's possible to make those properties themselves <code>abstract</code> and have derived class override them and return some value instead of passing the value to the base constructor to set.

","33708","","<p><code>&lt;% %&gt;</code> declares a code block. What you can do in a code block is similar to a body of a function.

","33708","","<p>The common language runtime contains a verifier that makes sure the running code (verifiable IL) cannot possibly corrupt memory in the managed environment. This prevents you to declare such a structure in which fields overlap. Basically, your struct contains two data members. One integer (which is 4 bytes) and a native integer (pointer size). On a 32 bit CLR, in which you are probably running your code, the <code>char[]</code> will take 4 bytes so if you put the integer less than four bytes away from the beginning of the struct, you'll have overlapping fields. It's interesting to note that both of your code snippets with fail on a 64 bit runtime, as the pointer size is 8 bytes.</p>

If instead of dividing it in two 4 bytes ""variables"", I'd want to consider eight 1 byte variables I could use a bool, but there is no defined smaller variable in c#.

"<p>Right, so MS introduces <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb383977.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">Extension Methods for C# 3.0</a>. Basically, it allows you to add new methods to an existing classes without having to subclass from it or change its implementation. Immediately alarm bells go off in my mind.</p>

<p>1) You start implementing your own extension methods for a library or standard library classes. Now it is not standardized anymore.</p>

<p>2) In OOP, you define a new type either through inheritance or composition. What actually is extension methods then? Likewise, in using extension methods there is no explicit relationship defined.</p>

<p>3) Are extension methods portable between projects? What if two extension methods for a method exists?</p>

<p>So are extension methods a whole bunch of worms worth avoiding? I can see that there are merits in it, as in you type less, but somehow it looks like would lead to bad practice. </p>

<p>Opinions?</p>
","33708","","<p>Extension methods <strong>are not</strong> added to a type. They are just syntactic sugar. You can't access private stuff. An extension method is just like any static method that consumes a type.</p>

<p>Worst thing they can do is to harm readability and mislead people. Beyond the syntax, they are nonexistent.</p>

<h3>UPDATE (re comment):</h3>

<p>This is exactly what I meant from ""misleading people"" and ""harming readability."" Fortunately, Visual Studio is pretty helpful in distinguishing extension methods (using an icon in the IntelliSense list and the tooltip). Personally, I'm a little biased against adding a bunch of extension methods to <em>arbitrary</em> classes of the framework (with the exception of <code>sealed</code> classes where extension methods can make a lot of sense) unless they provide a significant benefit for the particular project. I prefer keeping extension methods mostly for interfaces and classes on top levels of inheritance hierarchy. This will make developers only use them where they are applicable to many cases in the framework rather than making any utility method an extension (IMO, this is direct artifact of autodiscovery of extension methods in a whole namespace. I really wish C# required you to add a <code>using</code> directive on a the specific <code>class</code> rather than automatically importing all extensions in a <code>namespace</code>).</p>

<p>In my experience, if you don't overuse extension methods by making every utility method that's used a few times (I've seen some people do this) an extension, it's rarely a maintenance problem. It will improve readability if used wisely. </p>

<p>Cluttering up classes with extension methods is not a good thing. At the extreme cases, it can be dangerous. One might introduce a <strong>name collision</strong> issue by adding a method to class with the same name of an already existing extension. This can break code snippets that previously called the extension and are now calling the new method.<br />
In my opinion, this is the biggest issue associated to extension methods. This makes good naming of extensions very important. </p>

","33708","","<p>No, there's no better built-in collection. I think your ""natural tendency"" is perfectly suited for solving this problem, as those are not really ""same keys,"" but unique keys composed of different parts and <code>Dictionary</code> does the job. You can also nest dictionary (makes sense if you have large number of values for each name):</p>

<pre><code>Dictionary&lt;string, Dictionary&lt;Type, object&gt;&gt; dict = ...;
var value = (T)dict[name][typeof(T)];
</code></pre>

<p>This approach will resolve to the element using a single hash table lookup. If you maintain a list of items for each element, you'll have to linearly traverse the list each time you need an element to lookup which defeats the purpose of using a <code>Dictionary</code> in the first place.</p>

","33708","","<p>It really depends on the situation. First of all, you should focus on correctness so that it doesn't freeze or die but if you need more reliability, you should first think about how you can gracefully recover from such a situation. You should think about why it might freeze or die and if it did, now what you can do. If you can't do anything good that reliably recovers from such a situation, you shouldn't even try.

<p>If you want to automatically map the columns to properties, the code idea is the same.

"<p>What is the best way to combine two uints into a ulong in c#, setting the high/low uints.</p>

","33708","","<pre><code>ulong mixed = (ulong)high &lt;&lt; 32 | low;

<p>The cast is very important. If you omit the cast, considering the fact that <code>high</code> is of type <code>uint</code> (which is 32 bits), you'll be shifting a 32 bit value 32 bits to the left. Shift operators on 32 bit variables will use shift stuff by <code>right-hand-side</code> mod 32. Effectively, <em>shifting a <code>uint</code> 32 bits to the left <strong>is a no-op</em></strong>. Casting to <code>ulong</code> prevents this.</p>

<p>Verifying this fact is easy:</p>

<pre><code>uint test = 1u;
Console.WriteLine(test &lt;&lt; 32); // prints 1
Console.WriteLine((ulong)test &lt;&lt; 32); // prints (ulong)uint.MaxValue + 1

<p><strong>Follow up answer:</strong> I don't think so. I'm afraid you'll have to manually specify the default argument in the method call. However, if <code>x</code> or <code>y</code> parameter had a different name like:</p>

"<p>I've found loads of practical examples of this, and understand the practical output when overriding or hiding methods, but I'm looking for some under the covers info on why this is and why C# allows it when according to the rules of polymorphism, this shouldn't be allowed - at least, insofar as my understanding of polymorphism goes (which seems to coincide with the standard definitions found on Wikipedia/Webopedia).</p>

    }
}

Class SecondDerived : Base
{
    public new void PrintName()
    {

<p>Using the following code:</p>

<pre><code>FirstDerived b = new FirstDerived();
BaseClass a = b;
b.PrintName();

<p>I get:</p>

<p>FirstDerived
FirstDerived</p>

<p>Okay, I get that, makes sense.</p>

c.PrintName();

</code></pre>

<p>I get:</p>

<pre><code>SecondDerived 
BaseClass

<p>Okay, that makes sense, too, instance a can't see c.PrintName() so it's using its own method to print its own name, however I can cast my instance to its true type using:</p>

<pre><code>((SecondDerived)a).PrintName();

<p>So what is going on under the covers and what does this mean in terms of polymorphism?  I'm told that this facility ""breaks polymorphism"" - and I guess according to the definition, it does.  Is that right?  Would an ""object oriented"" langage like C# really allow you to break one of the core principles of OOP?</p>
","33708","","<p>I answer ""how"" it works. Jon has answered the ""Why"" part.</p>

<p>Calls to <code>virtual</code> methods are resolved a bit differently to those of non-<code>virtual</code> ones. Basically, a <code>virtual</code> method declaration introduces a ""virtual method slot"" in the base class. The slot will hold a pointer to the actual method definition (and the contents will point to an overridden version in the derived classes and no new slot will be created). When the <em>compiler</em> generates code for a virtual method call, it uses the <code>callvirt</code> IL instruction, specifying the method slot to call. The <em>runtime</em> will dispatch the call to the appropriate method. On the other hand, a non-virtual method is called with a <code>call</code> IL instruction, which will be statically resolved to the actual method by the compiler, at compile time (only with the knowledge of the compile-time type of the variable). <code>new</code> modifier does nothing in the compiled code. It essentially tells the C# compiler ""Dude, shut up! I'm sure I'm doing the right thing"" and turns off the compiler warning. </p>

<p>A <code>new</code> method (actually, any method without an <code>override</code> modifier) will introduce a completely separate chain of methods (new method slot). Note that a <code>new</code> method can be <code>virtual</code> itself. The compiler will look at the static type of the variable when it wants to resolve the <em>method chain</em> and the run time will choose the <em>actual method</em> in that specific  chain.</p>

"<p>Hi
I've often wondered if the following scenario actually happens in c# </p>

<p>If I have a struct but I don't explicitly override any of the methods that derived from object such as ToString(), GetHashCode(), etc then if I declare a local instance of my struct class and call 'ToString()' on it, would my struct get boxed i.e would the CLR convert it implicitly to an object on the heap and then call ToString()? Or is it clever enough to know that there's no implementation for that struct and ignore it?</p>

<p>i.e</p>

    public float m_y;

<p>== Edit - Update==
Mehrdad's <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.reflection.emit.opcodes.constrained.aspx"">link to MSDN</a>, whilst being useful has confused me slighly.
I'll quote and see if any one can unpick this for me</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When a callvirt  method instruction
  has been prefixed by constrained 
  thisType, the instruction is executed
  as follows:</p>
  
  <p>If thisType is a reference type (as
  opposed to a value type) then ptr is
  dereferenced and passed as the 'this'
  pointer to the callvirt of method.</p>
  
  <p>If thisType is a value type and
  thisType implements method then ptr is
  passed unmodified as the 'this'
  pointer to a call  method instruction,
  for the implementation of method by
  thisType.</p>
  
  <p><strong>If thisType is a value type and
  thisType does not implement method
  then ptr is dereferenced, boxed, and
  passed as the 'this' pointer to the
  callvirt  method instruction.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So does that mean that if I don't explicitly implement ToString() on my struct type that it will fall into the last case and get boxed? Or am I mis-understanding it somewhere?</p>
","33708","","<p>No it's not boxed when you call <code>ToString</code> or <code>GetHashCode</code> if it's implemented by your struct (<a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.reflection.emit.opcodes.constrained.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">why should it? <code>constrained</code> IL instruction takes care of it</a>.) It's boxed when you call a non-virtual method (or a virtual method not overriden in the struct) on <code>System.Object</code> (its base class), i.e. <code>GetType</code>/<code>MemberwiseClone</code>.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Sorry for the misunderstanding it may have caused. I wrote the answer with overriding the methods in the struct in mind (that's why I mentioned non-virtual methods need boxing, I should have been more explicit not to confuse readers, especially since I missed your statement regarding not overriding the method) as if you don't override it, the <code>Object.ToString</code> method <strong>expects</strong> it's first argument (reference to <code>this</code>) to be a reference type (an <code>Object</code> instance). Obviously, the value has to be boxed in that call (as it's a call in the base class.) </p>

<p>However, the point is, the nature of calling a virtual method on a value type <strong>does not</strong> result in emitting the <code>box</code> instruction (unlike non-virtual methods on <code>Object</code> that always result in emitting an explicit <code>box</code> instruction.) It's the <code>callvirt</code> instruction that will do the boxing if it has to resort to the <code>Object.ToString</code> implementation (as you mentioned in the updated question) just like when you are passing a struct to a method that expects an <code>object</code> parameter.</p>

<p>The answer to your first question is yes, all fields are retrieved from the database with the first statement.</p>

<p>Yes, but in order to use SQL directly, you'll have to manually create entity classes, manually retrieve data using <code>SqlDataReader</code> or something to achieve the level of abstraction LINQ provides in that line.

"<p>.NET provides four very similar versions of <code>String.Format(...)</code> (excluding the one that takes an <code>IFormatProvider</code> argument):</p>

","33708","","<p>Yes. There is a performance difference associated with building an array and passing that one instead of simply passing individual arguments on stack.

<p>The truth lies in the stateless nature of HTTP. The Web server is out of the picture as soon as it finishes sending the response to the client.

"<p>Given a text file, how would I go about reading an arbitrary line and nothing else in the file?</p>

<p>Say, I have a file test.txt.  How would I go about reading line number 15 in the file?</p>

<p>All I've seen is stuff involving storing the entire text file as a String array and then using the value of the line number as the number of the String to use from the array... but there are some complications: The text file is enormously huge and the machine that the application I'm coding isn't exactly a top-notch system. Speed isn't the top priority, but it is definitely a major issue.</p>

The file is KINDA structured. It's got 25 lines of info and then <em>X</em> lines of numbers but line 17 of the first 25 has the value of <em>X</em>.</p>

<p>But then, there's 1 blank line and it repeats itself all over as a second record in the file and <em>X</em> can have a different value for each record.</p>

<p>What I want to do is read and store the first 25 lines as independent values and then store the next <em>X</em> (usually around 250) lines as an array. Then I'm going to store it in an SQL database and repeat with the NEXT record until I reach the <em>Y</em>th record (the number of records in the file is in line 3)</p>

Alright, I think I've gotten to a solution based on a combination of your alls' responses.</p>

<p>I'm going to read the first 25 lines and store it as an array. I'll copy the pertinent contents of the array to local variables then I'll delete the first 25 lines. Then, I can use the info to store the next <em>X</em> lines (the value of item 13 in the array) as an array, serialize it, store it in a database then delete the lines that I just read.</p>

<p>I could then repeat the process for each subsequent record.</p>

<p>Of course, this relies on one assumption I'm making, which to be honest, I'm not sure is true. Is it possible to delete the first <em>n</em> lines from a text file from within C# without having to read the entire thing and re-write it without the first <em>n</em> lines?</p>

The rules mentioned near the beginning of the page are correct (except the item ""Shared constructors are run before any types that derive from the type are loaded."" in which ""loaded"" is a bit vague.

"<p>If a .pdb (program debug) file is included with a .dll then line numbers appear in the stack trace of any exception thrown. Does this affect the performance of the application?</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>This question is not about release vs. debug, i.e. optimisations. It is about the performance implications of having .pdb files. Are the .pdb files read every time an exception is thrown? Is the information cached in some way when the assemblies are loaded? Or is it cached the first time a relevant exception is thrown? How much difference does it make?</p>
","33708","","<p>Not normally. PDBs and optimizations are orthogonal. One can be enabled regardless of the value of the other option. However, it might reduce performance if you want to actually use the information contained in PDB, like when you are accessing the <code>StackTrace</code> of an exception and it needs to get line numbers from PDB or when you call <code>new StackTrace(true)</code>. </p>

<p>The .NET framework has full support for <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/wa80x488.aspx"">Partial classes, interfaces, and methods</a>.  Is there a compelling reason that support for partial constructors was not added, in the same manner?</p>

<p>This seems like it would simplify class construction within partial classes.  For example, form constructors built by a designer in Windows Forms could have the form construction code directly in the constructor, split into two files.  Partial ""Initialize()"" methods seem to be a somewhat common pattern, which could be simplified in this case.</p>

<p>The only potential downside I can see would be the lack of determinism in the order of constructor calls, but in many cases, the ordering of the parts wouldn't matter.  If it did, you could always avoid the partial constructor.</p>
","33708","","<p>Well, <code>partial</code> classes and interfaces are another story. This concept would be comparable to <code>partial</code> methods. They actually does nothing but to tell the compiler this method can exist somewhere and if it doesn't remove the method call. It doesn't allow introduction of a duplicate method. </p>

<p>Since a constructor is never called directly, it wouldn't make any sense to have such a concept. I believe the current initialize pattern works pretty well in most scenarios. Introducing another partial thing would unnecessarily make the language more complex without introducing significant benefits.</p>

","33708","","<p>MVC projects created in Visual Studio use Web application project model by default. <code>App_Code</code> is mostly used by Web site model. I suggest reading about differences between them (<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/398037/asp-net-web-site-or-web-application"">another question covers this</a> and it's also covered extensively on MSDN). If you add a source file to <code>App_Code</code> in a Web application project, Visual Studio will compile it to a DLL (since it's included in the project) and puts it in <code>/bin</code>. At run time, the ASP.NET compiler sees <code>App_Code</code> and tries to compile the source in a different assembly. As a consequence, two separate classes with identical names will exist in two different assemblies and when the ASP.NET parser tries to compile the <code>.aspx</code> file, it'll fail to choose one.</p>

<h3>Update:</h3>

<p>Are those two (extension method and the class you're instantiating) in a single .cs file? Otherwise, probably, the class you're instantiating is in a source file with <strong>Build Action</strong> (right click on file, click properties) set to <strong>Content</strong> which tells Visual Studio to skip it in the build process (in that case, you won't be able to reference it in other .cs files that are outside <code>App_Code</code> but you'll be able to use it in the view since it'll only come to life at run time.) If the build action is <strong>Compile</strong>, you'll get an error. The issue is definitely not specific to extension methods.

Also, it may cause a memory leak for the previous value of the property.<br />
The reason it looks like working sometimes is that the object is probably not deallocated yet, by someone else.</p>

"<p>I am trying to perform some generic number manipulation independent of the number type. However, I know of no way to use generics to do this.

<p>In .NET, there's no deterministic <code>delete</code> (like C++, where you free up memory allocated to a single object.) Only GC can free memory. By forfeiting all references to an object, you'll let GC be able to deallocate the object if it wants to. You can force a garbage collection by calling the <code>System.GC.Collect</code> method. However, it's not recommended to manipulate with GC unless you really know what you are doing. GC is smart. It's rarely beneficial to force it.</p>

","33708","","<p>In the .NET Framework, most ""normal"" enums (e.g. <code>DayOfWeek</code>) have singular names and flag enums (e.g. <code>StringSplitOptions</code>, <code>BindingFlags</code>) have plural names. It makes sense, since a value of a flag enum can represent multiple items but for a non-flag enum, it can only represent a single item.</p>

<p>nothing else is necessary. Null check is unncessarily in VB.NET. It's done by <code>RaiseEvent</code> internistically.</p>

<h3>Response to comment:</h3>

<p>In C#, you save the delegate in a local variable to prevent race conditions. If you call a null delegate in C#, you'll get a <code>NullReferenceException</code>. To prevent it, you check it to ensure it's not null. If you write it as:</p>

<pre><code>if (StatusChanged != null) { 
   // another thread might set `StatusChanged` to null at this point
   // causing the next line to fail.
   StatusChanged(this, e);
}

<p>However, since VB does all this stuff in <code>RaiseEvent</code>, it's not necessary to check for nulls and consequently, it's not necessary to make a local copy of the delegate.</p>

"<p>I've got a client app which has to connect to a server and register for waiting, that is, it wants to be notified when the server is done with some processing. Ideally, I want to keep this client as simple as possible, but the question is, how to ""register for waiting"".

Now this list can only be displayed if <code>T</code> is an <code>IDisplayable</code>, so you could ask in the MyList class that T should implement IDisplayable. But you also want to use this list type in some places when T is not IDisplayable (and as a result this list will not be displayable). So is it possible to say that MyList implements IDisplayable if T implements IDisplayable? I would also be happy if <code>MyList&lt;T&gt;</code> always implements IDisplayable but throws an exception at runtime if you try to call <code>GetControl()</code> if T is not IDisplayable, but I'd like to know if there's a statically type-safe way to do it. Can this be done? Or am I looking at the wrong solution?</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>I agree with the suggestions so far that MyList may have too many responsibilities. My original idea was to create a <code>MyDisplayableList&lt;T&gt; : MyList&lt;T&gt; (where T : IDisplayable)</code>.</p>

<p>The problem with this approach is that I have a lot of methods that take a MyList and return a MyList (for example methods like Select in Linq). So if I use select on an MyDisplayableList I get back a MyList and them I'm unable to display it even though it is a MyList...is there a type safe way to handle this problem in C#?</p>
","33708","","<p>Simple. Check if the type is <code>IDisplayable</code>. If it's not, throw an <code>InvalidOperationException</code>:</p>

<pre><code>if (!typeof(IDisplayable).IsAssignableFrom(typeof(T)))

</code></pre>

<p>Or if you have an instance of <code>T</code>, simply check with that:</p>

<pre><code>IDisplayable disp = instanceOfT as IDisplayable;
if (disp == null)
    throw new InvalidOperationException();
// do stuff with `disp`.

<p>I'm most used to pointers being used in a contiguous, virtual memory space. For that usage, I can generally get by thinking of them as addresses on a number line.

"<p>My brain farts a lot when it comes to hex. Some people are abidextrous and others are just plain right handed... well, kind of like that, I'm VERY base10 I guess.</p>

<p>Anyway... I'm trying to make some firmware more efficient.  We have a function that's calculating a vehicle's speed based on some hex data it gets via the CANBUS.  Right now I'm converting it to a float so I can wrap my head around it but I'm wondering if we'd use less ROM space if we left it in integer format?  Can that be done without losing accuracy?  Right now my floats are accurate to 1/16th of a kph.  I know this function seems simple, but running hundreds of times per second it is bogging it down a little.</p>

<p>First, here is some sample data:</p>

<p>[06] [3c] ...
[06] [3a] ...
[06] [3b] ...
[06] [46] ...
[06] [3b] ...</p>

<p>I've left off the other 6 bytes as they don't relate to speed.  The byte on the left we'll call speed_a and the byte on the right is speed_b.  Here is the function to convert:</p>

<pre><code>float calculateSpeed()
{
    float speed;
    speed = ( ( float )speed_a * 256.0 + speed_b ) / 16.0;
    return speed;
}
</code></pre>

<p>So the data above would translate to:</p>

<p>99.7500
 99.6250
 99.6875
100.3750
 99.6875</p>

<p>and that does accurately reflect the true speed of the vehicle in kph.  For our application though, we don't really care what the true speed is because everything is relative. As long as we don't lose resolution we're happy.  I thought about just keeping everything in INT form, but then when you divide by 16 it just truncates.</p>

<p>I'm not an idiot about most things... but I'm an idiot with base2.</p>

"<p>Extract from CLR via C# on Boxing / Unboxing value types ...</p>

<p>On Boxing: If the nullable instance is not <strong>null</strong>, the CLR takes the value out of the nullable instance and boxes it. In other words a <strong>Nullable &lt; Int32 ></strong> with a value of <strong>5</strong> is boxed into a <strong>boxed-Int32</strong> with a value of 5.</p>

<p>On Unboxing: Unboxing is simply the act of obtaining a reference to the unboxed portion of a boxed object. The problem is that a boxed value type cannot be simply unboxed  into a nullable version of that value type because the boxed value doesn't have the <strong>boolean hasValue</strong> field in it. So, when unboxing a value type into a nullable version, the CLR must allocate a <strong>Nullable &lt; T ></strong> object, initialize the <strong>hasValue</strong> field to <strong>true</strong>, and set the <strong>value</strong> field to the same value that is in the boxed value type. This impacts your application performance (memory allocation during unboxing).</p>

<p><strong>Why did the CLR team go through so much trouble for Nullable types  ? Why was it not simply boxed into a Nullable &lt; Int32 > in the first place ?</strong> </p>
","33708","","<p>I remember this behavior was kind of last minute change. In early betas of .NET 2.0, <code>Nullable&lt;T&gt;</code> was a ""normal"" value type. Boxing a <code>null</code> valued <code>int?</code> turned it into a boxed <code>int?</code> with a boolean flag. I think the reason they decided to choose the current approach is consistency. Say:</p>

<pre><code>int? test = null;
object obj = test;
if (test != null)
   Console.WriteLine(""test is not null"");
if (obj != null)
   Console.WriteLine(""obj is not null"");
</code></pre>

<p>In the former approach (box <code>null</code> -> boxed <code>Nullable&lt;T&gt;</code>), you wouldn't get ""test is not null"" but you'd get ""object is not null"" which is weird. </p>

<p>Additionally, if they had boxed a nullable value to a <code>boxed-Nullable&lt;T&gt;</code>:</p>

<pre><code>int? val = 42;
object obj = val;

if (obj != null) {

}
</code></pre>

<p>Beside that, I believe the current behavior makes perfect sense for scenarios like nullable database values (think SQL-CLR...)</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<h3>Clarification:</h3>

<p>The whole point of providing nullable types is to make it easy to deal with variables that have no meaningful value. They didn't want to provide two distinct, unrelated types. An <code>int?</code> should behaved more or less like a simple <code>int</code>. That's why C# provides lifted operators. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So, when unboxing a value type into a nullable version, the CLR must allocate a <code>Nullable&lt;T&gt;</code> object, initialize the hasValue field to true, and set the value field to the same value that is in the boxed value type. This impacts your application performance (memory allocation during unboxing).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not true. The CLR would have to allocates memory <strong>on stack</strong> to hold the variable whether or not it's nullable. There's not a performance issue to allocate space for an extra boolean variable.</p>

"<p>what are the benefits of implementing an interface in C# 3.5 ?</p>
","33708","","<p>You'll be able to pass your object to a method (or satisfy a type constraint) that expects the interface as an argument. C# does not support ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck%5Ftyping"">duck typing</a>."" Just by writing the methods defined by the interface, the object will not automatically be ""compatible"" with the interface type:</p>

<pre><code>public void PrintCollection&lt;T&gt;(IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; collection) {
    foreach (var x in collection)
       Console.WriteLine(x);
}
</code></pre>

<p>If <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> did not implement the <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code> interface, you wouldn't be able to pass it as an argument to <code>PrintCollection</code> method (even if it had a <code>GetEnumerator</code> method).</p>

<p>Basically, an interface declares a contract. Implementing an interface enforces your class to be bound to the contract (by providing the appropriate members). Consequently, everything that relies on that contract (a method that relies on the functionality specified by the interface to be provided by your object) can work with your object too.</p>
"
"<p>I have the following code:  </p>

<pre><code>public List&lt;IWFResourceInstance&gt; FindStepsByType(IWFResource res)  
{  
    List&lt;IWFResourceInstance&gt; retval = new List&lt;IWFResourceInstance&gt;();  
    this.FoundStep += delegate(object sender, WalkerStepEventArgs e)   
                      {   
                        if (e.Step.ResourceType == res) retval.Add(e.Step);   
                      };  
    this.Start();  
    return retval;

<p>I hope my question was clear. </p>
","33708","","<p>No, it will not be removed automatically. In this sense, there's not a difference between an anonymous method and a ""normal"" method. If you want, you should manually unsubscribe from the event.</p>

I can then have a service layer that manipulates prices on it, changes stuff, etc.  Then, I can pass these objects as IShoppingCartItemReadOnly to some kind of presentation layer that won't change them.  (Yes, I know it technically <em>can</em> change them-- this is a design question, not security, etc.)</p>
","33708","","<p>It's not a particularly bad idea. You should be aware that the implementor <strong>can</strong> (if it implicitly implements the interface, then a single read/write property could satisfy both interfaces) provide two distinct implementations:</p>

"<p>I came across a strange problem today. I created a subclass of UIView and added only 1 method to the template code provided by xcode.</p>

<pre><code>@interface FloatView : UIView {

}
- (void)floatTest:(CGFloat)x;
@end

- (void)floatTest:(CGFloat)x {
  NSLog(@""float was %f"", x);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then in my appDelegate I had code like this:</p>

<pre><code>UIView *floatView = [[FloatView alloc] init];
[floatView floatTest:10.0f];
</code></pre>

<p>Pretty simple, right? What should this print out? I thought it would something like ""10.0000"", but no, it prints out ""0.000000"". </p>

<p>I wrestled with this for hours, trying to figure out what I was doing wrong, and then I changed the code in my appDelegate to </p>

<pre><code>FloatView *floatView = [[FloatView alloc] init];
[floatView floatTest:10.0f];
</code></pre>

<p>Only then, did it print out the expected ""10.0000"". Why is this so? I've declared FloatView as a subclass of UIView, shouldn't I be able to assign a FloatView object to a UIView pointer without problems?</p>

<p>Even though floatView was declared a pointer to a UIView, it's really a floatView and it should be able to handle the floatTest message? Am I totally off base here?</p>
","33708","","<p>Actually, polymorphism is working as expected. If it didn't work, nothing would have been printed (in your example, 0.0000 is being printed). The thing is, while your instance actually responds to <code>testFloat:10.0f</code> message, since the compiler can't statically see the method declaration (as <code>UIView</code> class doesn't declare such a method), it assumes that your method takes <code>...</code> as argument and returns <code>id</code>. </p>

<p>When <code>CGFloat</code> is passed to a method that expects variable number of arguments (<code>...</code>), it's promoted to <code>double</code>. Thus, the receiving method is passed a <code>double</code> argument and thinks it's a <code>float</code> and it doesn't get printed correctly. </p>

<p>You can verify this behavior by changing <code>NSLog</code> line to:</p>

<pre><code>NSLog(@""%f"", *(double*)&amp;x);
</code></pre>

<p>When the compiler sends the message to <code>FloatView*</code> rather than a <code>UIView*</code>, it can find the exact signature of the method. It can see it really expects <code>CGFloat</code> and doesn't promote the argument to <code>double</code>. As a result, it works correctly. </p>

<p>Additionally, if <code>UIView*</code> contained the method declaration that took a <code>CGFloat</code>, the compiler would call the method appropriately. To summarize, this is not a polymorphism issue; it's a missing method signature issue.</p>

"<p>I don't think this question has been asked before but I'm a bit confused on the best way to implement IDisposable on a sealed class - more particularly a sealed class that does not inherit from a base class ( i.e a 'pure sealed class' which is my made up term ).<br>
Dunno about you but I find the guidelines on implementing IDisposable very confusing - however what I want to know is if this would be sufficient and safe  </p>

<p>I'm doing some P/Invoke code that allocates an <code>IntPtr</code> through <code>Marshal.AllocHGlobal</code> and naturally, I want to cleanly dispose of the unmanaged memory I've created. So I'm thinking of something like this</p>

<pre><code>using System.Runtime.InteropServices;

{
     IntPtr ptr;
     int length;

     MemBlock(int size)

           length = size;
     }

     public void Dispose()
     {
          if (ptr != IntPtr.Zero)
          {
               Marshal.FreeHGlobal(ptr);
               ptr = IntPtr.Zero;

     {
           Dispose();
     }

}

<p>I'm assuming that because <code>MemBlock</code> is completely sealed and never derives from another class that implementing a <code>virtual protected Dispose(bool disposing)</code> is not necessary.  </p>

<p>All thoughts welcome</p>
","33708","","<p>The finalizer is necessary as a fallback mechanism to eventually free unmanaged resources if you forgot to call <code>Dispose</code>.</p>

<p>Is there any way to do something similar in C#?  </p>

<p>I realize this is likely one of the ways in which C# ""protects"" us from ourselves, so i'm not looking for an exact equivelent, but rather a similar concept... that is, being able to refer to the contents of some other variable, rather than the instance of the variable itself.</p>

<p>Here's my use case i'm thinking  of.  I have an array of strings.  I would like to have another array of references to those array elements.  Something like this (obviously not valid code):</p>

<p>Certainly, ref paramets do this, and out parameters allow you to write to a specific variable.  But what about non-parameters?  Can you store a ref?  Can you keep an array of refs or a dictionary?</p>

<p>It seems like if the ability to do it with parameters is present, there should be a way to do it without them.</p>
","33708","","<p>No. Putting <code>unsafe</code> code aside, which does allow holding pointers to memory locations, there's no way to store a reference to a variable in C#.</p>

<p><code>ref</code> and <code>out</code> arguments provide the only means to take a reference but you can't save them anywhere.</p>

<p>You can workaround this limitation by wrapping fields in a <code>class</code> and using its reference instead. This is what the compiler does to capture variables in closures:</p>

<p>For instance, when you write:</p>

<pre><code>int integer = 0;
Action&lt;int&gt; method = i =&gt; Console.WriteLine(i + integer);
integer = 42;
method(100); // prints 142, not 100
</code></pre>

<p>In the second line, the compiler will have to take out the anonymous method and store it as a separate method in the class. Obviously, that method won't have access to <code>integer</code> variable. It somehow needs to pass a ""reference"" to <code>integer</code> variable to that anonymous method. Since it's not possible, it'll generate a <code>class</code> with a field to hold an integer and uses an instance of that class to store the variable. Basically, the local variable is promoted to a field in a class and is stored in the heap.</p>

","33708","","<p>Because you can't. Generics are not templates. You shouldn't think about them like C++ templates and expect the same behavior. They are fundamentally different concepts.</p>

<p>The C# specification explicitly prohibits usage of type parameters as base class:</p>

<p>I understand what you want to do and its use. This is a traditional use case of C++ templates. Specifically, if this was possible to do using C# generics, things like <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/moq/""><code>Moq</code> library</a> could benefit from it. The problem is, C++ templates are compile time ""find and replace"" constructs while C# generics are a run time thing. </p>

<p>To demonstrate this fact, for this class:</p>

<pre><code>class Test&lt;T&gt; where T : class {
    // whatever contents it might have...
}

<p>only a single IL will be emitted at compile time and at run time, the JIT compiler would generate a <strong>single</strong> native code for all reference-type type parameters. This is not like C++ templates at all, where native code would be emitted for every <code>T</code> separately (it's subject to optimization but conceptually, they are completely separate pieces of code).</p>

","33708","","<p>In your example, only a single field will exist, that of the base class and you can't have different values in a single field. Beside that, you can only initialize <code>readonly</code> fields in the same class, not in derived classes. A workaround could be defining a generic class like:</p>

<pre><code>static class ProcessNames&lt;T&gt; {
   public static string Value { get; set; }
}

<p>and use <code>ProcessNames&lt;DerivedClassType&gt;.Value</code> instead. Obviously, the value will be publicly accessible this way.</p>

<p>However, you should see if defining the field in each derived class separately fits your need and only resort to workarounds if it does not.</p>

<p>The problem with this is that a lot of requests at once cause File.Exists() to hang. I would like to keep a quick and dirty HashSet of filenames known to be in the local folder, so that if the the user requests a file, and it exists in the HashSet, just redirect to it without doing the File.Exists(), if it doesn't exist int he HashSet, do the File.Exists() then add it.</p>

<p>There's another kind of unpredictability that is more philosophical. Even if you rely on external input (such as atmospheric noise or other means), are they really unpredictable?

<p>I recently had an issue where returning an anonymous type from a Linq .First() would not work when returned to the jQuery caller. I created a simply subclass inside my controller and simple assigned values from the query object and that seemed to serialize and work fine. </p>

<p>This worked:</p>

<pre><code>public class JsonJob
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Title { get; set; }
    public string Description { get; set; }
    public DateTime DateAdded { get; set; }
    public DateTime? DateModified { get; set; }
};

var jsonJob = from job in db.Jobs
              where job.Id == jobId
              select new JsonJob
              {
                  Id = job.Id,
                  Title = job.Title,
                  Description = job.Description,
                  DateAdded = job.DateAdded,
                  DateModified = job.DateModified
              };

return Json(jsonJob.First());
</code></pre>

<p>But this did not:</p>

<pre><code>var jsonJob = from job in db.Jobs
              where job.Id == jobId
              select job;

return Json(jsonJob.First());
</code></pre>
","33708","","<p>Your second query does not return an anonymous type. It probably returns an entity type (generated by the <code>DataContext</code> code generator from the DBML file), which might have a bunch of things you don't like. Returning an anonymous type shouldn't cause a problem as the <code>Json</code> method doesn't care about the type name at all:</p>

<pre><code>// anonymous type example:
var jsonJob = from job in db.Jobs
              where job.Id == jobId
              select new {  // Note that no class name is specified here 
                 job.Id,
                 job.Title, 
                 job.Description, 
                 job.DateAdded, 
                 job.DateModified
              };

"<p>I statically recompiled a Java lib which used generics a lot, like <code>Collection&lt;?&gt;</code>, but the emitted .NET dll only uses <code>Collection</code>, not with type parameters. How come? </p>
","33708","","<p>Java generics are dealt by the Java compiler and are converted to non-generic version at compile time. This is different from .NET where the CLR has first class support for type parameters. At the bytecode level, <code>ArrayList&lt;T&gt;</code> will just be a simple <code>ArrayList</code>.</p>

<p>To quote <a href=""http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/J2SE/generics/"">Java docs</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Generics are implemented by the Java compiler as a front-end conversion called <em>erasure</em>, which is the process of translating or rewriting code that uses generics into non-generic code (that is, maps the new syntax to the current JVM specification). <strong>In other words, this conversion erases all generic type information; all information between angle brackets is erased.</strong> For example, <code>LinkedList&lt;Integer&gt;</code> will become <code>LinkedList</code>. Uses of other type variables are replaced by the upper bound of the type variable (for example, <code>Object</code>), and when the resulting code is not type correct, a cast to the appropriate type is inserted. </p>

"<p>How Do You create a .net application with no UI.  How would I go about doing this?  I don't want it to be a console application.  The best choice would seem to be a winform application that never calls application.run. </p>

<p>The goal of the app is to be run and do a simple task. say check a server for an update or copy files.  Nothing long running where a windows service would be necessary.</p>
","33708","","<p>If Windows Service isn't an option, you can simply create an empty project (or console app) and set the compiler target to Windows Application in the project properties (<code>/t:winexe</code> command line option). This is essentially equivalent to your own proposal.</p>

<p>The whole point is, <code>/t:winexe</code> sets the <code>subsystem</code> flag in the generated binary to a Windows executable so that the command prompt is not shown when the app is executed.</p>
"
"<p>How does it work? Does it have distinct parts - some methods are managed, some are unmanaged, does it convert every method to managed, trying to keep everything managed and doing the interop calls when he must?</p>
","33708","","<p>There are three different <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/85344whh.aspx"">compiler switches</a> related to managed code generation in C++/CLI:</p>

<p><code>/clr:pure</code> makes the compiler produce MSIL code. No unmanaged functions are allowed (everything is compiled to MSIL). This mode is similar to <code>unsafe</code> C# code. In this mode, you can use the CRT there's a pure MSIL version of it available. Assemblies compiled in this mode cannot be used in partial trust environments that require verifiable code (e.g. some SQL Server hosted assemblies).  </p>

<p><code>/clr:safe</code> makes the compiler produce verifiable MSIL code, similar to the C# compiler. No C++ interop is allowed. You can run <code>/clr:safe</code> assemblies in partial trust environments where verifiability is enforced by security policy.</p>

<p><code>/clr</code> generates mixed assemblies. The binary will contain both MSIL code and native code. They are not mixed together in say, a single class. Managed and unmanaged parts are separate and the compiler will generate code to interop and marshal data between two parts as necessary.</p>

<p>To directly answer your question, no specific ""conversion"" is performed. Unmanaged code is simply not allowed in <code>pure</code> and <code>safe</code> modes. Where it's allowed, managed stuff are compiled down to MSIL and unmanaged stuff are compiled to machine code. Any interop between them requires the compiler to generate code. There's no magic there. It just hides some interop stuff from the programmer but the code is there nonetheless.</p>

"<p>And why doesn't it shows the real type (eg: List&lt;string&gt; instead of List`1)?<br>

<p><code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> is the C# style of naming that type.</p>

<p>The notation is a convention defined to give you the ability to overload generic types by parameter count. If you declare a class named <code>List</code> with two type parameters (e.g. <code>List&lt;T,U&gt;</code>) the compiler would be able to choose the right one. It'll be named:</p>

If two threads call your function at the same time, they might end up running the constructor twice, which is not what you want. Using the second snippet relieves you from manually locking and ensuring thread safety, as the compiler generates the appropriate code for you.</p>

"<p>What's the safest and best way to retrieve an unsigned long from a string in C++?</p>

<p>I know of a number of possible methods.</p>

<p>First, converting a signed long taken from atol.</p>

<pre><code>char *myStr; // Initalized to some value somehow.
unsigned long n = ((unsigned)atol(myStr));
</code></pre>

<p>The obvious problem with this is, what happens when the value stored in myStr is larger than a signed long can contain?  What does atol retrieve?</p>

<p>The next possibility is to use strtoul.</p>

<pre><code>char *myStr; // Initalized to some value somehow.
unsigned long n = strtoul(myStr, 0, 10);
</code></pre>

<p>However, this is a little over complicated for my needs.  I'd like a simple function, string in, unsigned long base 10 out.  Also, the error handling leaves much to be desired.</p>

<p>The final possibility I have found is to use sscanf.</p>

<pre><code>char *myStr; // Initalized to some value somehow.
unsigned long n = 0;
if(sscanf(myStr, ""%lu"", n) != 1) {
    //do some error handling
}
</code></pre>

<p>Again, error handling leaves much to be desired, and a little more complicated than I'd like.</p>

<p>The remaining obvious option is to write my own either a wrapper around one of the previous possibilities or some thing which cycles through the string and manually converts each digit until it reaches ULONG_MAX.</p>

<p>My question is, what are the other options that my google-fu has failed to find?  Any thing in the C++ std library that will cleanly convert a string to an unsigned long and throw exceptions on failure?</p>

<p>My apologies if this is a dupe, but I couldn't find any questions that exactly matched mine.</p>

"<p>This is a real beginner question (I'm still learning the Java basics).</p>

<p>I can (sort of) understand why methods would return a List&lt;String&gt; rather than an ArrayList&lt;String&gt;, or why they would accept a List parameter rather than an ArrayList. If it makes no difference to the method (i.e., if no special methods from ArrayList are required), this would make the method more flexible, and easier to use for callers. The same thing goes for other collection types, like Set or Map.</p>

<p>What I don't understand: it appears to be common practice to create local variables like this:</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;String&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();
</code></pre>

<p>While this form is less frequent:</p>

<pre><code>ArrayList&lt;String&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();
</code></pre>

<p>What's the advantage here?</p>

<p>All I can see is a minor disadvantage: a separate ""import"" line for java.util.List has to be added. Technically, ""import java.util.*"" could be used, but I don't see that very often either, probably because the ""import"" lines are added automatically by some IDE.</p>
","33708","","<p>When you read </p>

<pre><code>List&lt;String&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();
</code></pre>

<p>you get the idea that all you care about is being a <code>List&lt;String&gt;</code> and you put less emphasis on the actual implementation. Also, you restrict yourself to members declared by <code>List&lt;String&gt;</code> and not the particular implementation. You don't care if your data is stored in a linear array or some fancy data structure, as long as it looks like a <code>List&lt;String&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>On the other hand, reading the second line gives you the idea that the code <em>cares</em> about the variable being <code>ArrayList&lt;String&gt;</code>. By writing this, you are implicitly saying (to future readers) that you shouldn't blindly change actual object type because the rest of the code <strong>relies</strong> on the fact that it is really an <code>ArrayList&lt;String&gt;</code>.</p>

","33708","","<p>A <code>static</code> member belongs to a type rather than a specific instance of a type. It doesn't matter whether you have no instances of a class or you create a million instances when it comes to <code>static</code> members. Only <strong>one</strong> will exist. This is not the case for instance variables. Basically, each instance you create has its own specific instance variables. This is why you can't access instance members in static contexts without an object instance. It's not clear the instance member you want to access belongs to which object. You can, however, reference instance members in static contexts by specifying an object reference explicitly:</p>

"<p>So, I know that there is a difference between these two tidbits of code:</p>

T inc(const T&amp; t)
{
    return t + 1;
}

int inc(const int&amp; t)
{
    return t + 1;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I am confused as to what the functional differences between these two are. Can someone show some situations where these snippits act differently from each other?</p>
","33708","","<p>Template specialization is more generic than just overloading. You can specialize things like classes rather than just simple functions. Overloading only applies to functions.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> To clarify more per AraK's comment, you are really comparing apples and oranges here. Function overloading is used to introduce the ability to have different functions share a single name, if they have different signatures. Template specialization is used to define a specific code snippet for a specific type parameter. You can't have a template specialization if you don't have a template. If you remove the first piece of code that declares the generic template, you'll receive a compile time error if you try to use template specialization. </p>

<p>So, the goal of template specialization is pretty different from a function overload. They just happen to behave similarly in your example while they are fundamentally different. </p>

<p>If you provide an overload, you are declaring an independent method that happens to have the same name. You are not preventing the template to be used with the specific type parameter. To demonstrate this fact, try:</p>

<pre><code>template &lt;typename T&gt;
T inc(const T&amp; t)
{
    return t + 1;
}

int inc(const int&amp; t)
{
    return t + 42;
}

#include &lt;iostream&gt;
int main() {
   int x = 0;
   x = inc&lt;int&gt;(x);
   std::cout &lt;&lt; ""Template: "" &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; std::endl; // prints 1.

   x = 0;
   x = inc(x);
   std::cout &lt;&lt; ""Overload: "" &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; std::endl; // prints 42.
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, in this example, there are two distinct <code>inc</code> functions for <code>int</code> values: <code>inc(const int&amp;)</code> and <code>inc&lt;int&gt;(const int&amp;)</code>. You couldn't expand the generic template using <code>int</code> if you had used template specialization.</p>

"<p>I'm working on a hobby project of the game <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baroque%5Fchess"" rel=""nofollow"">Baroque Chess</a>. For those that haven't played it, it has the same basic rules as chess, but the methods for movement and capturing are different.</p>

<p>Naturally I created standard classes for the game: <code>GameState</code>, <code>Board</code>, <code>Square</code>, and a class designated for each piece that inherit from a <code>BasePiece</code>.</p>

<p>Each piece has 2 main virtual methods, <code>GetPossibleMoves(Board board)</code> and <code>GetCapturedSquares(Board board, Square toSquare)</code>.</p>

<p>Now, one of the pieces, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baroque%5Fchess#Chameleon.2FImitator"" rel=""nofollow"">the Imitator</a>, captures pieces by ""imitating"" the piece that it captures. For example, a Long Leaper can capture pieces by jumping over them. This means that the Imitator can jump over enemy Long Leapers to capture them (but cannot jump anything else).</p>

<p>I completed the <code>GetCapturedSquares()</code> functionality for all the pieces except the Imitator (which is definitely the trickiest of the pieces).</p>

<p>My basic algorithm for the Imitator was: </p>

<ul>
<li>find all the squares with enemy pieces on them</li>
<li>for each enemy piece...
<ul>
<li>create a simulated piece in the same location as the Imitator</li>
<li>find the valid captures if it were the simulated piece moving to a chosen square</li>
<li>verify the enemy square is in that list of captured squares</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Since I had already written the code for the other pieces' movements, I figured I would just instantiate new pieces and use their <code>GetCapturedSquares()</code> methods depending on which type of piece the enemy was. To do this, I setup up a <code>Dictionary</code> as you can see here that maps a <code>System.Type</code> to an instantiated object of said type:</p>

<pre><code>var typeToPiece = new Dictionary&lt;Type, BasePiece&gt;() 
{
    {typeof(Pincer), new Pincer() { Color = this.Color, CurrentSquare = this.CurrentSquare}},
    {typeof(Withdrawer), new Withdrawer() { Color = this.Color, CurrentSquare = this.CurrentSquare }},
    {typeof(Coordinator), new Coordinator() { Color = this.Color, CurrentSquare = this.CurrentSquare }},
    {typeof(LongLeaper), new LongLeaper() { Color = this.Color, CurrentSquare = this.CurrentSquare }},
    {typeof(King), new King() { Color = this.Color, CurrentSquare = this.CurrentSquare }},
};
//...
var possibleMoves = typeToPiece[enemySquare.Occupant.GetType()].GetPossibleMoves(board, toSquare);
</code></pre>

<p>Doing this makes me feel dirty inside. Is it more appropriate to create an <code>enum</code> or <code>string</code> that represents the piece type as the dictionary key, or does it really not matter? Is there a different way to handle this? I am of the opinion that it's fine just the way it is but I am interested in hearing your thoughts.</p>
","33708","","<p>I think you should add an <code>abstract</code> method to <code>BasePiece</code> that ""clones"" the current piece and returns the simulated piece.</p>

<p>You'd <code>override</code> this method in every piece type. To share code between them, you can add a <code>protected</code> method to the base class that copies the shared properties to the instance passed to it:</p>

<pre><code>abstract class BasePiece {
   protected BasePiece(BasePiece pieceToClone) {
      this.Color = pieceToClone.Color;
      this.CurrentSquare = pieceToClone.CurrentSquare;
   }
   public abstract BasePiece GetSimulatedClone();
}

class King : BasePiece {
   protected King(King pieceToClone) : base(pieceToClone) { }
   public King() { }
   public override BasePiece GetSimulatedClone() {
       return new King(this);

","33708","","<p>Yes, it can. <code>static</code> variables are stored in server memory. Note that they are <strong>shared among all users</strong> (like <code>Application</code> state) and it might require a locking mechanism to ensure thread safety. </p>

"<p>I have been trying to whip up a quick and dirty application. This application needs to support user authentication. To accomplish this, I thought I could rely on the built in Login control and utilize the credentials ability of the web.config like so:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;authentication mode=""Forms""&gt;
  &lt;forms defaultUrl=""/authenticated/menu.aspx"" loginUrl=""Default.aspx""&gt;
    &lt;credentials passwordFormat=""Clear""&gt;

    &lt;/credentials&gt;
  &lt;/forms&gt;
&lt;/authentication&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>However, it seems the Login control requires a Membership Provider. I have the following two questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Does a membership provider that works with the web.config exist? if so, where? I haven't been able to find one?</li>
<li>Is it possible to login to a web application using the credentials in the web.config?</li>
</ol>

"<p>I have a class that builds a url with query string parameters and so on. The class has a method: Url() which returns the complete url composed from the class properties and another method: UrlNew() which allows passing a predicate as parameter for the replacement of the value of one of the properties and THEN Returns the modified URL. Now, I need to modify this function to use TWO parameters, both predicates. How do I do that? I tried modifying the method's parameters as a List of predicates but I probably am not doing something right:</p>

<p>My OLD UrlNew() method looked like this:</p>

<pre><code>public static string Url() (Action&lt;LGUrlBuilder&gt; predicate)
    {
        var instance = new LGUrlBuilder();
        if (predicate != null) predicate(instance);
        return instance.BuildUrl();
    }

<pre><code>public static string UrlNew(List&lt;Action&lt;LGUrlBuilder&gt;&gt; predicateList)
    {
        var instance = new LGUrlBuilder();
        if (predicateList != null &amp;&amp; predicateList.Count &gt; 0)
        {
            foreach (Action&lt;LGUrlBuilder&gt; predicate in predicateList)

                if (predicate != null) predicate(instance);
            }
        }

        return instance.BuildUrl();
    }

<p>This compiles just fine but when I run it, using it in ASPX gives me this error:</p>

<pre><code>CS1660: Cannot convert lambda expression to type 'System.Collections.Generic.List&lt;System.Action&lt;public_site.Library.LG.LGUrlBuilder&gt;&gt;' because it is not a delegate type

","33708","","<p>Don't modify the function itself. Modify the method call like this:</p>

<pre><code>UrlNew(x =&gt; { func1(x); func2(x); });
</code></pre>

<p>But if you <em>really</em> want to take arbitrary number of delegate instances as arguments, try modifying it like:</p>

<pre><code>public static void UrlNew(params Action&lt;LGUrlBuilder&gt;[] list) {
    // ... do what you're already doing in the second snippet ...
}

"<p>I'm rather confused about properties and instance variables in Objective-C.</p>

<p>I'm about half-way through Aaron Hillegass's ""Cocoa Programming for Mac OS X"" and everything is logical. You would declare a class something like this:</p>

<pre><code>@class Something;

@interface MyClass : NSObject {
    NSString *name;
    NSArray *items;

    Something *something;

    IBOutlet NSTextField *myTextField;
}

@property (nonatomic, retain) NSString *name;
@property (nonatomic, retain) NSArray *items;
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><p>Since other objects need to manipulate our <code>name</code> and <code>items</code> instance variables, we use <code>@property</code>/<code>@synthesize</code> to generate accessors/mutators for them. Within our class, we don't use the accessors/mutators—we just interact with the instance variable directly.</p></li>
<li><p><code>something</code> is just an instance variable that we're going to use in our class, and since no one else needs to use it, we don't create a pair of accessors and mutators for it.</p></li>
<li><p>We need to interact with a text field in our UI, so we declare an <code>IBOutlet</code> for it, connect it, and we're done.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>All very logical.</p>

<p>However, in the iPhone world, things seem to be different. People declare properties for every single instance variable, declare properties for <code>IBOutlets</code>, and use accessors/mutators to interact with instance variables <strong>within</strong> the class (e.g. they would write <code>[self setName:@""Test""]</code> rather than <code>name = @""Test""</code>).</p>

<p>Why? What is going on? Are these differences iPhone-specific? What are the advantages of declaring properties for all instance variables, declaring properties for <code>IBOutlets</code>, and using accessors/mutators within your own class?</p>
","33708","","<p>In the iPhone world, there's no garbage collector available. You'll have to carefully manage memory with reference counting. With that in mind, consider the difference between:</p>

<pre><code>name = @""Test"";
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>self.name = @""Test"";
// which is equivalent to:
[self setName: @""Test""];
</code></pre>

<p>If you directly set the instance variable, without prior consideration, you'll lose the reference to the previous value and you can't adjust its retain count (you should have <code>release</code>d it manually). If you access it through a property, it'll be handled automatically for you, along with incrementing the retain count of the newly assigned object.</p>

<p>The fundamental concept is not iPhone specific but it becomes crucial in an environment without the garbage collector.</p>

<p>For small <strong>values</strong> like primitive types (where all matters is the contents of the object, not the actual referential identity; say, it's not a handle or something), <code>T arg</code> is generally preferred. For large objects and objects that you can't copy and/or preserving referential identity is important (regardless of the size), passing the reference is preferred.</p>

<p>Another advantage of <code>T arg</code> is that since it's a copy, the callee cannot maliciously alter the original value. It can freely mutate the variable like any local variables to do its work.</p>

"<p><strong>Background</strong><br />
Let's say I have the following class:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyValue&lt;T&gt;
{
    public T Value { get; set; }    
    public static bool operator ==(MyValue&lt;T&gt; first, MyValue&lt;T&gt; second)
    {
        // if first and second are the same instance, they are equal
        if (object.Equals(first, second))
        {
            return true;
        }

        // for each of the objects, get a value indicating whether either
        // the object or its Value property is null
        bool firstIsNull = object.Equals(first, null) ? true : first.Value == null;
        bool secondIsNull = object.Equals(second, null) ? true : second.Value == null;

        // if both are null, they are equal
        if (firstIsNull &amp;&amp; secondIsNull)
        {
            return true;
        }

        // Not both are null. If one is, they are not equal
        if (firstIsNull || secondIsNull)
        {
            return false;
        }

        // Neither first nor second is null; compare their values
        return first.Value.Equals(second.Value);
    }    
    // more code implementing !=, Equals, GetHashCode, implicit conversions and so on
}
</code></pre>

<p>This class will be used as the type on properties in an object model. An object could look like so:</p>

<pre><code>public class SomeClass
{

    public SomeClass()
    {
        SomeValue = new MyValue&lt;string&gt;();
    }
    public MyValue&lt;string&gt; SomeValue { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The idea with this is that the class simply represents the value of its <code>Value</code> property. It has some more functionality that is stripped away since it's not relevant for the question (some validation and stuff). Since the class has no value in itself, we want it to be as little intrusive as possible when used. Implicit conversions allows for code like this:</p>

<pre><code>SomeClass instance = new SomeClass();
instance.SomeValue = ""my string"";
</code></pre>

<p><strong>...and the question:</strong><br />
The idea with overloading the == (and !=) operator is to have an instance of the object where <code>Value</code> is <code>null</code> to compare equal to <code>null</code> (partly because we feel it makes sense, partly because of backwards compatibility issues in the object model):</p>

<pre><code>MyValue&lt;string&gt; a = new MyValue&lt;string&gt;();
MyValue&lt;string&gt; b = null;
bool areTheyEqual = (a == b); // this will be true
</code></pre>

<p>This may of course seem a bit confusing, but given that <code>MyClass</code> is simply a wrapper, that in most of the code will be rather invisible, does it make sense to you too, or is it something really bad that we will regret for reasons that we overlooked?</p>
","33708","","<p>In my opinion, <code>==</code> operator in C# is already confusing enough. If you overload it like that, you'll be increasing the possibility of confusion.</p>

if (c == null) { // true
}

object co = c;
if (co == null) { // false. WTF!?

"<p>I am using the Entity Framework and have got a loop that looks at a set of People and using a foreach loop creates a query for the address of each person. As each address query is created it is added to the node of a treeview where it can be later used (to populate children nodes):</p>

<pre><code> IQueryable&lt;Person&gt; pQuery = (IQueryable&lt;Person&gt;)myContext.People; //get a list of people

 //go through and get the set of addresses for each person
 foreach (var p in pQuery)
 {
      var addressQuery = from a in myContext.Addresses

     //add the query to a TreeView node (use the tag to store it)
     TreeNode newNode = new TreeNode();
     newNode.Tag = addressQuery;
 }
</code></pre>

<p>Now, the problem that I am finding upon running the app is that ALL the queries are the last query created i.e. the last iteration of the loop. It is like the addressQuery is created on the first iteration of the loop and then overwritten on each subsequent query. The result of this is that it is like all the address queries in the treenodes are references to the last query made(?)</p>

<p>Further investigation that I could solve the problem by using a static class to generate the address query and pass that into each the TreeNode, as follows:</p>

<pre><code> public static class Queries
    {
        public static IQueryable&lt;Address&gt; AddressesForPerson(GenesisEntities myContext, int key)
        {
            var query = from a in myContext.Addresses
                        from al in a.Address_Links
                        where al.P_ID == key
                        orderby a.A_POST_CODE
                        select a;
            return query;
        }

}
</code></pre>

<p>The question I have is that I am baffled by this behaviour. Why does having a static query class help me? Can anyone explain to me what is going on?</p>

<p>Confused.Com!</p>
","33708","","<p>The reason is that the <code>p</code> variable (the <code>foreach</code> loop variable) is captured and the query is evaluated lazily. As a result, when the query is actually run, it uses the current value of <code>p</code> variable at that time, which is the last value.

<p>To solve the problem, simply try introducing a temporary variable:</p>

 foreach (var loopVariable in pQuery) 
 {
      var p = loopVariable; // This variable is scoped **inside** loop body.

<p>It's a design decision. Implementing both will be costly and make framework more bloated and you'll need to support both when adding features.

 - ""On the other hand, all primitive data types in C# are objects in the System namespace. For each data type, a short name, or alias, is provided. For instance, <code>int</code> is the short name for System.Int32"".</p>

<p>My confusion lies largely with C# (I have programmed java for some while). </p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> The following paragraph has been confirmed to be correct by @Jon Skeet</p>

<ul>
<li>Java has two types (primitive and class). The words ""value type"" could be a synonym for primitive (although not widely used) and ""reference type"" for class. Java ""wraps"" primitives (int) in classes (Integer) and these classes have the complete power of any other class (can be null, used in collections, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> @Jon has given a very clear statement on C# so I will delete my suggested truths and refer to his answer.</p>

<p>Further question: Is there a consensus on what the actual use of these terms should be? If there is a consensus I'd be very grateful for it spelt out explicitly. Otherwise I assume the terminology is muddled and therefore of limited use.</p>

<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong> Thanks for very clear answers. There is a consensus (see accepted answer from @Jon)  among those who really understand this and the MS docs are consistent (although they refer to Java in places and I misread these for C#)</p>
","33708","","<p>I haven't seen MS docs to be contradictory about this (MSDN is sometimes wrong, but on this specific issue, I've always seen it correct). The MSDN link you posted says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>For each primitive data type in Java</strong>,
  the core class library provides a
  wrapper class that represents it as a
  Java object. For example, the Int32
  class wraps the int data type, and the
  Double class wraps the double data
  type.</p>
  
  <p><strong>On the other hand</strong>, all primitive data
  types in C# are objects in the System
  namespace. For each data type, a short
  name, or alias, is provided. For
  instance, int is the short name for
  System.Int32 and double is the short
  form of System.Double.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basically, it's saying the right thing. In Java, <code>Integer</code> class is a wrapper for <code>int</code> primitive type. In C#, <code>int</code> is an alias for <code>System.Int32</code> structure. The first paragraph is about Java and <strong>doesn't apply</strong> to C#.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>In .NET, the terminology is as follows:</p>

<p>A <em>primitive type</em> is a type that has <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.type.isprimitive.aspx""><code>IsPrimitive</code> property</a> set to true. Primitive types are: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The primitive types are Boolean, Byte,
  SByte, Int16, UInt16, Int32, UInt32,
  Int64, UInt64, IntPtr, UIntPtr, Char,
  Double, and Single.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All primitive types are value types but <strong>not vice versa</strong>.</p>

<p>A <em>value type</em> is a <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/ericlippert/archive/2009/04/27/the-stack-is-an-implementation-detail.aspx"">type that has value semantics, as opposed to reference semantics</a>. The whole value is copied when passed by value (not its reference). Local variables of value types are stored on stack. <code>struct</code>s and  <code>enum</code>s are value types.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, all primitive types are value types. They are <code>struct</code>s in the <code>System</code> namespace. In C#, <code>int</code>, <code>double</code>, etc., keywords are basically aliases for those <code>struct</code>s.</p>

"<p>I think this is the question, anyway. I am using a RelayCommand, which decorates an ICommand with two delegates. One is Predicate for the _canExecute and the other is Action for the _execute method.</p>

<p>---Background motivation --</p>

<p>The motivation has to do with unit testing ViewModels for a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows%5FPresentation%5FFoundation"" rel=""nofollow"">WPF</a> presentation. A frequent pattern is that I have one ViewModel that has an ObservableCollection, and I want a unit test to prove the data in that collection is what I expect given some source data (which also needs to be converted into a collection of ViewModels). Even though the data in both collections looks the same in the debugger, it looks like the test fails due to an equality failure on the ViewModel's RelayCommand. Here's an example of the failing unit test:</p>

<pre><code>[Test]
    public void Creation_ProjectActivities_MatchFacade()
    {
        var all = (from activity in _facade.ProjectActivities
                   orderby activity.BusinessId
                   select new ActivityViewModel(activity, _facade.SubjectTimeSheet)).ToList();

        var models = new ObservableCollection&lt;ActivityViewModel&gt;(all);
        CollectionAssert.AreEqual(_vm.ProjectActivities, models);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>--- Back to delegate equality ----</p>

<p>Here is the code for the RelayCommand - it's basically a direct rip-off of Josh Smith's idea, with an implementation for equality that I added in an attempt to solve this issue:</p>

<pre><code>public class RelayCommand : ICommand, IRelayCommand
{
    readonly Action&lt;object&gt; _execute;
    readonly Predicate&lt;object&gt; _canExecute;

    /// &lt;summary&gt;Creates a new command that can always execute.&lt;/summary&gt;
    public RelayCommand(Action&lt;object&gt; execute) : this(execute, null) { }

    /// &lt;summary&gt;Creates a new command which executes depending on the logic in the passed predicate.&lt;/summary&gt;
    public RelayCommand(Action&lt;object&gt; execute, Predicate&lt;object&gt; canExecute) {
        Check.RequireNotNull&lt;Predicate&lt;object&gt;&gt;(execute, ""execute"");

        _execute = execute;
        _canExecute = canExecute;
    }

    [DebuggerStepThrough]

        add { CommandManager.RequerySuggested += value; }
        remove { CommandManager.RequerySuggested -= value; }
    }

    public void Execute(object parameter) { _execute(parameter); }

    {
        if (ReferenceEquals(null, obj)) return false;
        if (ReferenceEquals(this, obj)) return true;
        if (obj.GetType() != typeof(RelayCommand)) return false;
        return Equals((RelayCommand)obj);

    {
        unchecked
        {
            return ((_execute != null ? _execute.GetHashCode() : 0) * 397) ^ (_canExecute != null ? _canExecute.GetHashCode() : 0);
        }
    }

}

<p>---- EDITED REMARKS ----</p>

<p>As Mehrdad pointed out, the get_CloseCommand from the debug session looks a bit weird at first. It really is just a property get, but it does raise the point as to why the equality of the delegate is problematic if I need to do tricks to make it work.</p>

<p>Some of the point of MVVM is to expose whatever might be useful in a presentation as properties, so you can use WPF binding. The particular class I was testing has a WorkspaceViewModel in it's heirarchy, which is just a ViewModel that already has a close command property. Here is the code:</p>

<p>public abstract class WorkspaceViewModel : ViewModelBase
    {</p>

<pre><code>    /// &lt;summary&gt;Returns the command that, when invoked, attempts to remove this workspace from the user interface.&lt;/summary&gt;
    public ICommand CloseCommand
    {
        get
        {
            if (_closeCommand == null)
                _closeCommand = new RelayCommand(param =&gt; OnRequestClose());

            return _closeCommand;
        }
    }
    RelayCommand _closeCommand;

    /// &lt;summary&gt;Raised when this workspace should be removed from the UI.&lt;/summary&gt;
    public event EventHandler RequestClose;

    void OnRequestClose()
    {
        var handler = RequestClose;
        if (handler != null)
            handler(this, EventArgs.Empty);
    }

    public bool Equals(WorkspaceViewModel other) {
        if (ReferenceEquals(null, other)) return false;
        if (ReferenceEquals(this, other)) return true;
        return Equals(other._closeCommand, _closeCommand) &amp;&amp; base.Equals(other);
    }

    public override int GetHashCode() {
        unchecked {
            {
                return (base.GetHashCode() * 397) ^ (_closeCommand != null ? _closeCommand.GetHashCode() : 0);
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can see that the close command is a RelayCommand, and that I monkeyed with equals to make the unit test work.</p>

<p>@Merhdad
Here is the unit test that only works when I use Trickster's delegate.Method in the equality comparison.</p>

","33708","","<p>Are you creating the delegate out of anonymous functions or something? These are the exact delegate equality rules according to C# specification (§7.9.8):</p>

<blockquote>
  <h3>Delegate equality operators</h3>
  
  <p>Two delegate instances are considered equal as follows:
  If either of the delegate instances is <code>null</code>, <strong>they are equal if and only if both are <code>null</code></strong>.<br />
  If the delegates have different runtime type <strong>they are never equal</strong>.
  If both of the delegate instances have an invocation list (§15.1), those instances are equal if and only if their invocation lists are the same length, and each entry in one’s invocation list is equal (as defined below) to the corresponding entry, in order, in the other’s invocation list.
  The following rules govern the equality of invocation list entries:<br />
  If two invocation list entries both <strong>refer to the same <code>static</code> method</strong> then the entries are equal.<br />
  If two invocation list entries both <strong>refer to the same non-<code>static</code> method</strong> on the <strong>same target object</strong> (as defined by the reference equality operators) then the entries are equal.<br />
  Invocation list entries produced from evaluation of semantically identical <em>anonymous-function-expressions</em> <strong>with the same (possibly empty) set of captured outer variable instances</strong> are <strong>permitted (but not required)</strong> to be equal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, in your case, it's possible that the delegate instances are referring to the same method in two different objects, or referring to two anonymous methods.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Indeed, the problem is that you are not passing the same method reference when you are calling <code>new RelayCommand(param =&gt; OnCloseCommand())</code>. After all, the lambda expression specified here is actually an anonymous method (you are not passing a method reference to <code>OnCloseCommand</code>; you are passing a reference to an anonymous method which takes a single parameter and calls <code>OnCloseCommand</code>). As mentioned in the last line of the specification quotation above, it's not necessary that comparing those two delegates return <code>true</code>.</p>

<p><em>Side Note:</em> The getter of the <code>CloseCommand</code> property would be simply called <code>get_CloseCommand</code> and not <code>&lt;get_CloseCommand&gt;b__0</code>. This is the compiler generated method name for the anonymous method inside <code>get_CloseCommand</code> method (the <code>CloseCommand</code> getter). This further proves the point I mentioned above.</p>

"<p>I am learning C++. I am trying to learn this dynamic memory allocation. In the below code I am trying to allocate memory using <code>malloc</code> and <code>realloc</code>.</p>

<pre><code>int main (void)  {
  char *g = (char*) malloc (sizeof(char) * 2);
  g = ""ab"";
  g = (char*) realloc (g, sizeof(char) * 200);
  strcpy (g, ""cdefg"");
  cout &lt;&lt; g &lt;&lt; endl;
  return 0;
}

<p>I get <strong>segmentation fault</strong> error when I execute this code.</p>

<p>I've seen other SO threads recommending to use either <code>vector</code> or <code>new</code> instead of using above approach. Since, I am trying to learn this approach, so these answers does not applies to my question.</p>

<p>I've encountered a scenario where this approach will be well fitted, for example, If I am reading a raw text file using <code>ifstream.read</code> function and reading, let's say 1024bytes of it. Now, If I want to make sure I am not reading a word which is broken due to 1024bytes size I have to read further from that position using <code>ifstream.get</code> to reach until a space character is found. In this scenario, I need to adjust the buffer (which is of 1024) slightly more. My intention is to use <code>realloc</code> here to assign some more memory to it. </p>

<p>Please feel free to correct me if I am wrong anywhere.</p>
","33708","","<p>The problem is that the line:</p>

<pre><code>g = ""ab"";
</code></pre>

<p>sets the <code>g</code> pointer to another location altogether. It does not copy the contents. You lose track of the original location and when you use <code>g</code> in <code>realloc</code>, you'll be <code>realloc</code>ing the wrong pointer.</p>

<p>Replace the line with:</p>

<pre><code>strcpy(g, ""ab"");
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, you'll need three bytes to store the string and the terminating <code>'\0'</code> character.</p>

<p>That said, <code>malloc</code> and <code>realloc</code> are C style things. If you are using C++, you should try <code>new</code> and <code>delete</code> and probably use <code>string</code> type to store strings.</p>

<p>So, is there a way to run a check on the heap's integrity, or is there a way to check how much stack is left on a thread?</p>

<p>I use lots of unsafe code for speed reasons, so it is quite likely I have code corrupting memory somewhere. Unfortunately, the crash happens at random intervals after the corruption  happens.

<blockquote>
  <p>A <em>constrained execution region</em> (CER) is part of a mechanism for authoring reliable managed code. A CER defines an area in which the common language runtime (CLR) is constrained from throwing out-of-band exceptions that would prevent the code in the area from executing in its entirety. Within that region, user code is constrained from executing code that would result in the throwing of out-of-band exceptions. The <code>PrepareConstrainedRegions</code> method must immediately precede a <code>try</code> block and marks <code>catch</code>, <code>finally</code>, and <code>fault</code> blocks as constrained execution regions. Once marked as a constrained region, code must only call other code with strong reliability contracts, and code should not allocate or make virtual calls to unprepared or unreliable methods unless the code is prepared to handle failures. The CLR delays thread aborts for code that is executing in a CER.</p>

","33708","","<p>C++ is not Python. You write statements in functions and execution starts from the <code>main</code> method. The reason <code>bool b = ...</code> happens to work is that it's <strong>defining</strong> the global variable <code>b</code> and the function call is merely the initialization expression. </p>

<p>for some reason, the first s in split1 is giving a value of """". there's nothing in it. why is it starting ONE before the first element?</p>

","33708","","<p>Your approach works fine. It's a little inefficient as it requires two dictionary lookups (one for <code>Contains</code> and one for adding the item to the list).

<p>It's more efficient to fill the list and add it to the dictionary in one go (if it's possible in your case, of course). In C# 3.0, there's a feature called <em>collection initializers</em> that makes it easy to fill a list if items are known at compile time:</p>

","33708","","<p>I'll answer your second question first. The thing you wrote (""establishing a path"") which happens in some network architectures (GSM voice calls, for instance) but not in the Internet is called <em>circuit switching</em>. With circuit switching, the network infrastructure itself is aware of a communication happening between the two endpoints. The TCP/IP stack, however, is designed to be <em>packet switched</em>. It means each packet is a separate piece of information that's delivered to the other endpoint and is unrelated to any other packet (like posting a message). </p>

<p>As a consequence, the lower level protocols in the IP stack do not guarantee that:</p>

<ul>
<li>packets are received at the destination</li>
<li>packets are received in any particular order</li>
<li>packets are received at the destination just once</li>
</ul>

<p>UDP in particular, does not try to solve these issues. On the other hand, TCP protocol has to get rid of these issues. It uses acknowledgements and packet sequence numbers to handle them. In TCP, a single packet is not unrelated to other packets. As a result, both parties should negotiate a <em>simulated communication path</em> built on the stateless IP. This negotiation is called a connection. It's basically establishing a relationship between the packets in a chain.</p>

"<p>Is it possible to get the comment description of a method or property using reflection.

How can I access this data programmatically using reflection?

","33708","","<p>No. The method description is defined in an XML file (with the same name as the declaring assembly) extracted from XML comments in the source code. Visual Studio uses that XML file to load those stuff. The information is nowhere in the assembly metadata and naturally, it's not available using reflection:</p>

<pre><code>/// &lt;summary&gt; Method description &lt;/summary&gt;
public void Something() { ... }

<p>When the C# compiler is invoked with <code>/doc</code> switch, it extracts the XML tags and puts it in the XML file. Visual Studio checks if an XML file is available along the referenced assembly and displays the description as appropriate.</p>

","33708","","<p>You should pass <code>DateTimeFormatInfo.InvariantInfo</code> as an argument to the <code>DateTime.ToString</code> method. <code>/</code> in the format string does <strong>not</strong> mean <code>""/""</code> character all the time. It resolves to the date separator of the current culture:</p>

<pre><code>return tempDateTime.ToString(""yyyy/MM/dd:HH:mm:ss"", DateTimeFormatInfo.InvariantInfo);
</code></pre>

<p>In general, it's a good practice to always clearly specify the culture in <code>ToString</code> and <code>Parse</code> methods (not only on <code>DateTime</code>s). FxCop (VS Code Analysis) has rules that spit out warnings when you don't do this. It's critical for non-US cultures and the importance is often underestimated by many programmers. </p>

"<p>Suppose I want to have an inheritance hierarchy like this.</p>

<pre><code>class Base

<p>The base class is not meant to be instantiated, and thus has some pure virtual functions that the derived classes must define, making it an abstract base class.</p>

<p>However, there are some functions that you would like your derived classes to get from your base class. These functions modify private data members that both <em>DerivedOne</em> and <em>DerivedTwo</em> will have.</p>

<pre><code>class Base {
public:
      virtual void MustDefine() =0; // Function that derived classes must define
      void UseThis(); // Function that derived classes are meant to use
};

<p>However, the <code>UseThis()</code> function is meant to modify private data members. That's where the question comes in. Should I give the <em>Base</em> class dummy private data members? Should I give it protected data members (and thus the derived classes won't declare their own private data members). I know the second approach will decrease encapsulation.</p>

"<p>I'm learning to write custom type conversions in C# and I have a question I can't manage to resolve with Google / MSDN / earlier posted SO items.</p>

<p>Normally, a C# program that narrows a numeric type does that via unchecked explicit conversion, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>int i = 256;
byte b = (byte)i; // b == 0
</code></pre>

<p>however, the following will give an overflow exception:</p>

<pre><code>byte b = checked((byte)i);

  public static explicit operator int(Foo bar) {
    if (checked)
      throw someEception
    else
      return some Foo to int conversion

","33708","","<p><code>checked</code> is a compile time thing. That is, its sole effect will be on the code block <strong>directly</strong> surrounded by a <code>checked</code> statement, not the methods called in that block.

<p>I've got 2 functions that I want to call, and use the return values to figure out the return value of a 3rd composite function.  The issue is that I always want both functions to evaluate (as they output log information about the state of the system)</p>

<hr>

<p>Summary of responses:</p>

<p>The ""bitwise"" operators | and &amp; can be used to get the effect, but only if the return type is bool.  I found no mention of this in the ANSI C++ spec. From what I can tell, this works because the ""bool"" is converted to an int (true = 1, false = 0), and then the bitwise operator is used, then it is converted back to a bool.</p>

<p>The Operators ""<code>+</code>"" and ""<code>*</code>"" can also be used.  This is not mentioned in the ANSI C++ Spec, but probably works because of the same reason as above.  ""<code>+</code>"" give ""or"" because true is converted to 1, and then anything other than 0 is converted back to true.  ""<code>*</code>"" works for ""and"" because 1 (true) * 0 (false) == 0(false) and 1(true) * 1(true) == 1(true)</p>

<p>Both of these seem to rely on implicit type conversion to integer and then back to bool.  Both of these will likely mess up whomever tries to maintain the code.</p>

<p>Other responses boil down to ""Just use temporaries"" or ""Implement your own"" which was not the question.  The goal was to see if there was already an operator implemented in the C++ standard to do it.</p>
","33708","","<p>The <code>&amp;</code> operator performs logical ""and"" operation for <code>bool</code> operands and is not short circuited.</p>

<p>It's not a sequence point. You cannot rely on the order of evaluation of the operands. However, it's guaranteed that both operands are evaluated.</p>

<p>Or is it?</p>
","33708","","<p>The compiler is not able to statically analyze all code paths and take into account all possibilities all the time. Theoretically, complete analysis of a program behavior just by looking into its source code can provide a solution to halting problem, which is undecidable. Compilers have a limited set of static analysis rules to detect rules. The C++ standard does not require the compiler to issue such kind of warnings, so, no. It's not a bug. It's more like a nonexistent feature.</p>

<p>When I have single element in <code>this.splits</code>, check is returning false. I have checked by some other way, check is always returning false. Any idea why this is happening?</p>
","33708","","<p>Depends on the way the enumerator is implemented. The implementation is free to return a copy or the object itself. In fact, it can return whatever it likes; for instance, <code>Enumerable.Range</code> returns a sequence of numbers and none of the elements are actually stored anywhere. They are generated on the fly. If the return type is a value-type, it's certainly a copy of something.</p>

<p>Also, nothing requires the object to return the same sequence each time <code>GetEnumerator</code> is called on it. In your code example, it does it once in <code>foreach</code> and another time when you call <code>.First</code>. These sequences are not required to be equivalent.</p>

"<p>Basically i want to know if the visual studio IDE and/or compiler in 2010 and 2012 was <em>written</em> to make use of a multi core environment (i understand we can target multi core environments in all versions using parallelism, but that is not my question).</p>

<p>I am trying to decide on if i should get a higher clock dual core or a lower clock quad core, as i want to try and figure out which processor will give me the absolute best possible experience with Visual Studio 2010 or 2012 (v11) (ide and background compiler).</p>

<p>If they are running the most important section (background compiler and other ide tasks) in one core, then the core will get cut off quicker if running a quad core, especially if background compiler is the heaviest task, i would imagine this would be difficult to separate in more than one process, so even if it uses multi cores you might still be better off going for a higher clock CPU if the majority of the processing is still bound to occur in one core (i.e. the most significant part of the VS environment).</p>

<p>Is this how the sort function works, or is there another sorting algorithm I don't know about, that would allow for short circuiting like it is?</p>
","33708","","<p>The algorithm you just described has a specific name: ""selection sort"". It's O(n<sup>2</sup>) so it's not quite the fastest thing you could do. However, if you want the first ""k"" elements in the sorted array, the complexity would be O(kn) which is nice if ""k"" is small enough (like your example).</p>

<p>Note that you are using a pure function in a functional language.

<p>I'm curious to find out who choose to use only certain language features and avoid others in order to win big in areas such as, but not limited to, memory usage, execution speed or plain old readability and maintainability. And by doing so did it yield the expected results or did it perhaps just hamper some other aspect of producing software.

"<p>Studing STL I have written a a simple program to test functors and modifiers. My question is about the difference aon using CLASS or STRUCT to write a functor and try to operate on it with function adaptors.
As far as I understand in C++ the difference beetween CLASS and STRUCT is that in the last case the members are public by default. This is also what I read many times in the answers in this site.

<p>Seems that at least in this case a struct is not equivalent to a class with public members, but why ?</p>
","33708","","<p>The difference you read from other answers is correct. <code>struct</code> is just a <code>class</code> with <code>public</code> accessibility by default. This includes the <em>inheritance modifier</em>. Basically, you should mention <code>public</code> before the base class name when you're using a <code>class</code> to make those definitions equivalent:</p>

<pre><code>template &lt;class T&gt;
class mystruct : public binary_function&lt;T ,T ,bool&gt; {
    public:
    bool operator() (T  i,T  j) const { return i&lt;j; }
};
</code></pre>

<p>Otherwise, the compiler will assume that <code>mystruct</code> is privately inheriting <code>binary_function&lt;T,T,bool&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>You can verify this fact by changing the <code>struct</code> to:</p>

<pre><code>struct  mystruct : private binary_function&lt;T ,T ,bool&gt; {
    public: // not required here
    bool operator() (T  i,T  j) const { return i&lt;j; }
};
</code></pre>

<p>which is equivalent to your current definition of the <code>class</code> and see the compiler whine with a similar error message.</p>

","33708","","<p>I guess the issue is the 64-bitness of your machine. The driver is an unmanaged component and you probably have a single version of it (32-bit or 64-bit) installed on your machine. Since you cannot load 32-bit unmanaged components in a 64 bit process (and vice versa), it'll not work. Switch the target CPU setting of your project to x64 and x86 to force the assembly to run with the appropriate bitness and retry. It's likely to solve your problem.</p>

<p>Do I have to add <code>new</code> modifier to Derived.value declaration? What changes?</p>
","33708","","<p>Since the <code>value</code> field is <code>private</code>, it's not accessible in the derived class. Thus, the declaration in the derived class does not really hide anything. You shouldn't add <code>new</code> to the declaration. If you do, nothing changes, except the compiler will warn you about using <code>new</code> incorrectly. If the <code>value</code> field was accessible in the derived class (e.g. it was <code>public</code>), then you should have used <code>new</code> to express your intention to hide the base member:</p>

<pre><code>class A {
    public int field;
}
class B : A {
    public int field; // warning. `B.field` hides `A.field`. 
}

"<p>This is causing a StackOverFlow error and I have an idea why, but I would like a little more detail on why and is my solution for it the way it should be handled.  Ok, first things first, the following code causes a StackOverFlow error when I try to assign a value to the property:</p>

<pre><code>private List&lt;Albums&gt; albums

    {
    albums = value;
    Session[""albums""] = albums;
    }
}

<p>To resolve the above, I changed the name of the property and added another variable to hold the value of the property which resolved the StackOverFlow issue:</p>

<pre><code>private List&lt;Albums&gt; albums = null;
private List&lt;Albums&gt; Albums
{
    get
    {
        if (Session[""albums""] != null)

    Session[""albums""] = albums;

","33708","","<p>The problem is with this line:</p>

<p>You are recursively setting the property to <code>value</code> which will call the setter again and again, until it stackoverflows. There's no point in that line of code. Just get rid of it. </p>

<p>I guess there's a false misconception that a property needs to be bound to a field or something. It's not. A property, by itself, is just a couple unrelated methods, that are not required to have any specific relation to each other or to a field. When you retrieve the property value, you just call its <code>get</code> method and use the return value and when you set its value, you call its <code>set</code> method with the appropriate <code>value</code> argument. You don't need to somehow ""change"" the property value in setter. The semantics are automatically enforced as you are changing the value that <code>get</code> is going to return so the next time you call get, it will return <code>Session[""...""]</code> which you have already changed. </p>

"<p>I solely work with web applications, so I have virtually no real experience with Windows Forms designed in .NET.</p>

<p>I'm reading up on assemblies, and there are two types; static, which comes in .dll form, and exectuable, which comes in .exe form.</p>

<p>As far as I can work out, an 'executable assembly' is just another name for a compiled application (that is, a console application or a Windows Forms application).</p>

<p>Can you clarify it?</p>

<p>Edit: My terminology comes from this article: <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/k3677y81%28VS.71%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/k3677y81%28VS.71%29.aspx</a></p>

<p>Edit 2: OK, so now, as I understand it, you have static and dynamic assemblies, static exists on disk, dyanmic is created on the fly/on demand. 
Secondly, you have executable assemblies, which are our applications, such as a console application like <code>helloworld.exe</code>.</p>
","33708","","<p>I've never heard of the term ""static assembly"" for executable files or class libraries. Basically, a .NET assembly can have an entry point. The ones that have an entry point and are executable directly from the operating system shell (or the CLI runtime, to be more accurate) are "".exe"" files and the ones that don't have an entry point and are used merely as supporting libraries of other applications are stored as "".dll"" files.</p>

<h3>Update:</h3>

<p>Looking at the reference you provided, it's clear what it means from a ""static assembly"":</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Assemblies can be static or dynamic. Static assemblies can include .NET Framework types (interfaces and classes), as well as resources for the assembly (bitmaps, JPEG files, resource files, and so on). Static assemblies are stored on disk in portable executable (PE) files. You can also use the .NET Framework to create dynamic assemblies, which are run directly from memory and are not saved to disk before execution. You can save dynamic assemblies to disk after they have executed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The MSDN article is calling the assemblies stored as files on disk ""static assemblies"", as opposed to ""dynamic assemblies"" that are generated at runtime by some code (e.g. classes in <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.reflection.emit.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">System.Reflection.Emit</a> namespace). It doesn't matter whether they are DLLs or EXEs (both of the file types have a Portable Executable (PE) header, as well as a CLR header). Only thing that matters is that they are not generated dynamically (hence the term ""static"") and are previously stored on disk. Outside the context of dynamically generated assemblies, the term ""static assembly"" is rarely used.</p>

"<p>I've been doing some performance testing, mainly so I can understand the difference between iterators and simple for loops. As part of this I created a simple set of tests and was then totally surprised by the results. For some methods, 64 bit was nearly 10 times faster than 32 bit.</p>

<p>What I'm looking for is some explanation for why this is happening. </p>

<p>[The answer below states this is due to 64 bit arithmetic in a 32 bit app. Changing the longs to ints results in good performance on 32 and 64 bit systems.]</p>

var arrayLength = 100000;
var array = new long[arrayLength];
for (var i = 0; i &lt; arrayLength; i++)
{

<p>The things I read from this are that using LongLength is slow. If I use array.Length, performance for the first for loop is pretty good in 64 bit, but not 32 bit.</p>

<p>The other thing I read from this is that iterating over an array is as efficient as a for loop, and the code is much cleaner and easier to read!</p>
","33708","","<p>x64 processors contain 64 bit general purpose registers with which they can calculate operations on 64 bit integers in a single instruction. 32 bit processors does not have that. This is especially relevant to your program as it's heavily using <code>long</code> (64-bit integer) variables.</p>

<p>For instance, in x64 assembly, to add a couple 64 bit integers stored in registers, you can simply do:</p>

<pre><code>; adds rbx to rax
add rax, rbx
</code></pre>

<p>To do the same operation on a 32 bit x86 processor, you'll have to use two registers and manually use the carry of the first operation in the second operation:</p>

<pre><code>; adds ecx:ebx to edx:eax
add eax, ebx
adc edx, ecx
</code></pre>

<p>More instructions and less registers mean more clock cycles, memory fetches, ... which will ultimately result in reduced performance. The difference is very notable in number crunching applications.</p>

<p>For .NET applications, it seems that the 64-bit JIT compiler performs more aggressive optimizations improving overall performance.</p>

<p>Regarding your point about array iteration, the C# compiler is clever enough to recognize <code>foreach</code> over arrays and treat them specially. The generated code is identical to using a <code>for</code> loop and it's in recommended that you use <code>foreach</code> if you don't need to change the array element in the loop. Besides that, the runtime recognizes the pattern <code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; a.Length; ++i)</code> and omits the bound checks for array accesses inside the loop. This will not happen in the <code>LongLength</code> case and will result in decreased performance (both for 32 bit and 64 bit case); and since you'll be using <code>long</code> variables with <code>LongLength</code>, the 32 bit performance will get degraded even more.</p>

This allows me to prevent people from scraping every image off of the site.  (Without being logged in, and scraping the HTML as well, that is.)</p>

","33708","","<p>A struct is a value type. <code>System.Object</code> is a reference type. Value types and reference types are stored and treated differently by the runtime. For a value type to be treated as a reference type, it's necessary for it to be boxed. From a low level perspective, this includes copying the value from the stack where it originally lives to the newly allocated memory on the heap, which also contains an object header. Additional headers are necessary for reference types to resolve their vtables to enable virtual method dispatches and other reference type related features (remember that a struct on stack is just a value and it has zero type information; it doesn't contain anything like vtables and can't be directly used to resolve dynamically dispatched methods). Besides, to treat something as a reference type, you have to have a <em>reference</em> (pointer) to it, not the raw value of it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So my question is - if A is an descendant of System.Object, can't compiler upcast it to object type instead of boxing?</p>

<p>At a lower level, a value does not inherit anything. Actually, as I said before, it's not really an object. The fact that A derives from <code>System.ValueType</code> which in turn derives from <code>System.Object</code> is something defined at the abstraction level of your programming language (C#) and C# is indeed hiding the boxing operation from you pretty well. You don't mention anything explicitly to box the value so you can simply think the compiler has ""upcasted"" the structure for you. It's making the <strong>illusion</strong> of inheritance and polymorphism for values while none of the tools required for polymorphic behavior is directly provided by them.</p>

That is, <code>List&lt;string&gt;</code> is not going to be compatible with <code>List&lt;object&gt;</code> in C# 4.0, but <code>IEnumerable&lt;string&gt;</code> can be used as an <code>IEnumerable&lt;object&gt;</code> since the type parameter for <code>IEnumerable</code> is only used as the return value (an output position) of the <code>Current</code> property.</p>

"<p>Have you ever tried to use the <code>Convert.ChangeType()</code> method to convert a value to a <code>Nullable&lt;T&gt;</code> type? Awkwardly, it will throw an <code>InvalidCastException</code> saying ""Null object cannot be converted to a value type"".</p>

<p>Try running this on your immediate window: <code>?System.Convert.ChangeType(null, typeof(int?))</code></p>

<p>For some obscure reason, Nullables are considered value types. For example, <code>typeof(int?).IsValueType</code> returns <code>true</code>.</p>

<p>For me, since <code>Nullable&lt;T&gt;</code> accept <code>null</code>, it's a class type, not a value type. Does anyone know why it would implemented differently?</p>
","33708","","<p><code>System.Nullable&lt;T&gt;</code> is technically a structure, so it's a value type (the <code>null</code> value for a <code>Nullable&lt;T&gt;</code> is not exactly the same thing as a null reference. It's a boolean flag that denotes the lack of a value.)  However, it's treated specially by the runtime and this makes it an awkward value type. First, it doesn't satisfy <code>where T : struct</code> type constraint (it doesn't satisfy <code>where T : class</code> either, for what it's worth). Second, it exhibits an interesting boxing behavior. Boxing a <code>Nullable&lt;T&gt;</code> will result in:</p>

<ul>
<li>A <code>null</code> reference, if the value is <code>null</code>.</li>
<li><p>A boxed value of the <em>underlying type</em> if it actually contains a value. That is, in the statements:</p>

<pre><code>int? x = 2;
object y = x;
</code></pre>

<p><code>y</code> is not a boxed <code>Nullable&lt;int&gt;</code>. It's simply a boxed <code>int</code>. You can unbox any boxed value of type <code>T</code> to <code>Nullable&lt;T&gt;</code> (and <code>T</code>, of course). Casting a <code>null</code> reference to <code>Nullable&lt;T&gt;</code> results in a <code>null</code> value (as you might expect).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This special treatment by the runtime makes nullable types work more similar to the way <code>null</code> works in reference types.</p>

I am just curious what exactly is simple evenhandler good for.
I can have:</p>

<pre><code>event EventHandler blah;
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>delegate void Blah();
event Blah Blah1;
</code></pre>

<p>Is there some advantage of using EventHandlers except sparing an extra line of code? Thanks.</p>
","33708","","<p>An <code>EventHandler</code> is a <code>delegate</code> with a couple extra parameters. The first one is the sender, that is, the object that caused that event and the second is extra event data. It's simply a consistent pattern useful for declaring events. Without passing the sender as an argument, you cannot easily detect which object caused it and this might result in unnecessarily duplicated (copy-and-pasted) code. If you follow the standard event pattern, your event handler can carry on different tasks based on a property of the object that caused the event.</p>

<p>Besides, some events carry extra information along them, for example an event typed <code>MouseEventHandler</code> will pass the location of the mouse pointer in its second argument (<code>MouseEventArgs</code>) for your event handler to consume. The good thing about this pattern is that you can ignore the auxiliary data if your event handler is general and doesn't need it. You are able to hook up a method with <code>EventHandler</code> signature to a <code>MouseEventHandler</code> event, for example (since the type of the second argument inherits from <code>EventArgs</code>).</p>

<p>By the way, in general, hash tables are not good data structures for these kind of problems (where you don't have the key and are matching the key based on a function) as you'll have to enumerate the whole table all the time.

<p>It can not print the right size??</p>
","33708","","<p>You <em>can't</em> do that for a dynamically allocated array (or a pointer). For static arrays, you can use <code>sizeof(array)</code> to get the whole array size in bytes and divide it by the size of each element:</p>

<p>To get the size of a dynamic array, you have to keep track of it manually and pass it around with it, or terminate it with a sentinel value (like '\0' in null terminated strings).</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I realized that your question is tagged C++ and not C. You should definitely consider using <code>std::vector</code> instead of arrays in C++ if you want to pass things around:</p>

If we strip executable file format could we see same machine code (like 2 + 2) for both operating systems?</p>

","33708","","<p>There are many differences. Among them:</p>

<li><p><strong>Application Binary Interface</strong>: Each OS defines a set of primary system functions and the way a program calls them. This is fundamentally different between Linux and Windows. While the instructions that compute 2 + 2 are identical on Linux and Windows in x86 architecture, the way the application starts, the way it prints out the output, and the way it exits differs between the operating systems. </p></li>

"<p>I'm trying to enforce an inheritor of an abstract class to initialize one of the fields in the base.</p>

<p>I can't do this via a constructor in the base because the type of the field requires a reference back to the object creating it. (I suppose I could provide a parameterless ctor for the field type. But I feel that would just be shifting the problem, and it should be immutable anyway).</p>

<p>Perhaps someone can suggest how to do it, or maybe make it so I don't need to do it at all?</p>

<p>This is pretty much what I'm doing:</p>

<pre><code>public abstract class Base
{
    // Would like to force setting in CTOR
    protected BaseImplementation _implementation;  
    protected BaseImplementation Implementation 
    { get { return _implementation; } }

    public void DoSomething()
    {    
        Implementation.DoSomething();
    }
}

public abstract class BaseImplementation
{
    public abstract void DoSomething();
}

public class MyObject : Base
{
    // Note its Nested
    public class MyImplementation : BaseImplementation
    {
        private MyObject _myObject;

        public MyImplementation(MyObject myObject)
        {
            this._myObject = myObject;
        }

        public override void DoSomething()
        {
            // Does something
        }
        public virtual void SomethingElse()
        {
            // Does something else 
        }
    }

    new public MyImplementation Implementation
    {
        get { return (MyImplementation) _implementation; }
    }

    public void SomethingElse()
    {
        Implementation.SomethingElse();
    }
}

<p>I forgot to mention that I'm not using an Abstract property because it means I cant use <code>new public MyImplementation Implementation {...</code>. I don't want to have to cast Implementation to MyImplementation whenever I use functionality specific to the derived class <em>(thus using <code>new</code> in the first place)</em> or create multiple fields containing the same object.</p>

<p>The decision to not allow partial methods to have multiple implementations is an arbitrary decision made in the design of the language. Your argument is a good reason why you might decide against allowing such a thing in your language but there isn't really a technical limitation. You can very easily decide to allow multiple implementation and let the compiler decide the order of execution of implementations. Actually, C# specification already has cases with undefined order for <code>partial</code> classes:</p>

partial class Program {
    static int x = y + 42;
    static void Main() {
       System.Console.WriteLine(""x: {0}; y: {1}"", x, y);

<p>My goal is to set different defaults for variables based on debug vs release mode. </p>
","33708","","<p>By default, Visual Studio defines DEBUG if project is compiled in Debug mode and doesn't define it if it's in Release mode. RELEASE is not defined in Release mode by default. Use something like this:</p>

"<p>I've just run into what I think is an oddity in type-casting. I have code similar to the following:</p>

<pre><code>interface IMyClass { }

class MyClass: IMyClass { }

class Main
{
  void DoSomething(ICollection&lt;IMyClass&gt; theParameter) { }

  HashSet&lt;MyClass&gt; FillMyClassSet()
  {
    //Do stuff
  }

  void Main()
  {
    HashSet&lt;MyClass&gt; classSet = FillMyClassSet();
    DoSomething(classSet);
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>When it gets to DoSomething(classSet), the compiler complains that it can't cast HashSet&lt;MyClass&gt; to ICollection&lt;IMyClass&gt;. Why is that? HashSet implements ICollection, MyClass implements IMyClass, so why isn't the cast valid?</p>

<p>Incidentally this isn't hard to work around, thought it's slightly awkward.</p>

<pre><code>void Main()
{
  HashSet&lt;MyClass&gt; classSet = FillMyClassSet();
  HashSet&lt;IMyClass&gt; interfaceSet = new HashSet&lt;IMyClass&gt;();
  foreach(IMyClass item in classSet)
  {
    interfaceSet.Add(item);
  }
  DoSomething(interfaceSet);
}
</code></pre>

<p>To me, the fact that this works makes the inability to cast even more mysterious.</p>
","33708","","<p>It won't work because all instances of <code>MyClass</code> being <code>IMyClass</code> doesn't automatically imply that all instances of <code>HashSet&lt;MyClass&gt;</code> are also <code>HashSet&lt;IMyClass&gt;</code>. If it worked, you could:</p>

<pre><code>ICollection&lt;IMyClass&gt; h = new HashSet&lt;MyClass&gt;();
h.Add(new OtherClassThatImplementsIMyClass()); // BOOM!
</code></pre>

<p>Technically, it doesn't work because C# (&lt;= 3.0) generics are invariant. C# 4.0 introduces safe-covariance, which doesn't help in this case either. It does, however, help when interfaces use the type parameters only in input or only in output positions. For instance, you'll be able to pass a <code>HashSet&lt;MyClass&gt;</code> as an <code>IEnumerable&lt;IMyClass&gt;</code> to some method.</p>

<p>By the way, they are easier workarounds than manually filling another <code>HashSet</code> like:</p>

<pre><code>var newSet = new HashSet&lt;IMyClass&gt;(originalSet);
</code></pre>

<p>or you can use the <code>Cast</code> method if you want to cast a set to an <code>IEnumerable&lt;IMyClass&gt;</code>:</p>

"<p>Is there a case where pass-by-reference is more expensive than pass-by-value in C++? If so, what would that case be?</p>
","33708","","<p>Yes, accessing a passed by reference argument might require more levels of indirection than a passed by value argument.

"<p>I'm trying to find the best approach to filtering a list with C# (3.5) but I can't seem to find any examples that are similar to my situation.  I'm open to using lambdas or linq. </p>

<p>The thing that is unique compared to most of the examples that I've found, is that my list items each have child arrays for example...</p>

<pre><code>var employees= new List&lt;Employee&gt;
{
    new Employee{Name = ""John"",Nicknames=""'J','Big J','Big John'""},
    new Employee{Name = ""Joshua"",Nicknames=""'J','Josh','Joshman'""},
}

<p>I'd then like to filter that list something like this...</p>

<pre><code>//using linq
var matchesByNickname =
from worker in employees
where worker.Nicknames.Equals(""J"")
select worker;

//or lambda
var employees2 = employees
    .Where(e =&gt; Nicknames.Exists(n =&gt; n.Nickname == ""J""))
</code></pre>

<p>But of course since Nicknames is itself an array I cannot use .Equals or .Contains etc.  What would be the best approach to filtering a list of this type?</p>

<p>UPDATE:
In trying to keep my example simple I've misled you a bit.  The list items do have true object arrays on them, not strings.  My real world example is a list of custom product objects.  The product object has a Regions property on it which is a list of Region objects.  A product can have none, 1, or more than 1 region.  The region object has a name and an id.
So what I really want is to filter a list of products, for any product assigned to a certain region.</p>
","33708","","<p>In your example, <code>Nickname</code> is not an array as I see it. It's a string. Assuming it's an array of strings, you could:</p>

<pre><code>var employees2 = employees.Where(e =&gt; e.Nicknames.Contains(name));
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to keep it as is (string), you can try something along the lines of:</p>

<pre><code>var employees2 = employees.Where(e =&gt; e.Nicknames.Split(',')
                                                 .Contains(""'"" + name + ""'""));
</code></pre>

<p>In both of the cases above, you can replace <code>Where</code> with <code>FindAll</code> and get results back in a <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> instead of an <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code> (<code>List&lt;T&gt;.FindAll</code> has been around since 2.0 but <code>Enumerable.Where</code> is new in 3.5). </p>

<p>Of course, ideally, you'll make it an array or list like the following and use the first method:</p>

<pre><code>var employees = new List&lt;Employee&gt;
{
    new Employee{Name = ""John"",Nicknames= new [] {""J"", ""Big J"", ""Big John""}},
    new Employee{Name = ""Joshua"",Nicknames = new [] {""J"", ""Josh"", ""Joshman""}},
};
</code></pre>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Your real world example is not so much different from this sample case. I <em>think</em> you're looking for <code>Any</code> instead of <code>Contains</code> since you are checking a property, not the whole object for equality:</p>

<pre><code>var filteredProducts = products
        .Where(p =&gt; p.Regions.Any(r =&gt; r.Name == ""regionToSearchFor""));

"<p>This is more a general purpose programming question than language specific. I've seen several appraoches to try and catches.</p>

<p>One is you do whatever preprocessing on data you need, call a function with the appropriate arguments and wrap it into a try/catch block.</p>

<p>The other is to simply call a function pass the data and rely on try catches within the function, with the function returning a true/false flag if errors occured.</p>

","33708","","<p>Every ""module"" in an application is responsible for handling its own input parameters. Normally, you should find issues as soon as possible and not hand garbage to another part of the application and rely on them to be correct. There are exceptions though. Sometimes validating an input parameter basically needs reimplementing what the callee is supposed to do (e.g. parsing an integer) in the caller. In this case, it's usually appropriate to try the operation and see if it works or not. Moreover, there are some operations that you can't predict their success without doing them. For example, you can't reliably check if you can write to a file before writing to it: another process might immediately lock the file after your check. </p>

"<p>In development blogs, online code examples and (recently) even a book, I keep stumbling about code like this:</p>

<pre><code>var y = x as T;
y.SomeMethod();
</code></pre>

<p>or, even worse:</p>

<pre><code>(x as T).SomeMethod();
</code></pre>

<p>That doesn't make sense to me. If you are sure that <code>x</code> is of type <code>T</code>, you should use a direct cast: <code>(T)x</code>. If you are not sure, you can use <code>as</code> but need to check for <code>null</code> before performing some operation. All that the above code does is to turn a (useful) <code>InvalidCastException</code> into a (useless) <code>NullReferenceException</code>.</p>

<p>Am I the only one who thinks that this a blatant abuse of the <code>as</code> keyword? Or did I miss something obvious and the above pattern actually makes sense?</p>
","33708","","<p>Your understanding is true. That sounds like trying to micro-optimize to me. You should use a normal cast when you are sure of the type. Besides generating a more sensible exception, it also fails fast. If you're wrong about your assumption about the type, your program will fail immediately and you'll be able to see the cause of failure immediately rather than waiting for a <code>NullReferenceException</code> or <code>ArgumentNullException</code> or even a logical error sometime in the future. In general, an <code>as</code> expression that's not followed by a <code>null</code> check somewhere is a code smell.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you are not sure about the cast and expect it to fail, you should use <code>as</code> instead of a normal cast wrapped with a <code>try-catch</code> block. Moreover, use of <code>as</code> is recommended over a type check followed by a cast. Instead of:</p>

<pre><code>if (x is SomeType)
   ((SomeType)x).SomeMethod();
</code></pre>

<p>which generates an <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.reflection.emit.opcodes.isinst.aspx""><code>isinst</code> instruction</a> for the <code>is</code> keyword, and a <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.reflection.emit.opcodes.castclass.aspx""><code>castclass</code> instruction</a> for the cast (effectively performing the cast twice), you should use:</p>

<pre><code>var v = x as SomeType;
if (v != null)
    v.SomeMethod();
</code></pre>

<p>This only generates an <code>isinst</code> instruction. The former method has a potential flaw in multithreaded applications as a race condition might cause the variable to change its type after the <code>is</code> check succeeded and fail at the cast line. The latter method is not prone to this error.</p>

<hr>

<p><sub>The following solution is <em>not recommended</em> for use in production code. If you really hate such a fundamental construct in C#, you might consider switching to VB or some other language.</sub></p>

<p>In case one desperately hates the cast syntax, he/she can write an extension method to mimic the cast:</p>

<pre><code>public static T To&lt;T&gt;(this object o) { // Name it as you like: As, Cast, To, ...

A similar end can only be achieved by placing an extension method <code>GetValue&lt;&gt;(this IReadOnlyDictionary&lt;TKey, TValue&gt; self, TKey key)</code> somewhere which would somehow internally have to call an an actual implementation, which arguably looks like a quite messy approach.</p>
","33708","","<p>It's a feature. .NET 4.0 only supports <strong>safe</strong> covariance. The cast you mentioned is potentially dangerous as you could add a non-string element to the dictionary if that was possible:</p>

<ul>
<li>It must not have an <strong>""open generic type""</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>I understand generics somewhat and use them to some extent, but:</p>

<ul>
<li>What is an <strong>open generic type</strong> in .Net.</li>
<li>Is there such a thing as a <strong>closed generic type</strong>?</li>
<li><strong>Open generic type</strong> is a term not used very often. What is used / confused with it ?</li>
</ul>
","33708","","<p>The C# language defines an open type to be a type that's either a type argument or a generic type defined with unknown type arguments:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All types can be classified as either open types or closed types. An <em>open type</em> is a type that involves type parameters. More specifically:  </p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>A type parameter defines an open type.    </li>
  <li>An array type is an open type if and only if its element type is an open type.</li>
  <li>A <em>constructed type</em> is an open type if and only if one or more of its type arguments is an <em>open type</em>. A <em>constructed nested type</em> is an open type if and only if one or more of its type arguments or the type arguments of its containing type(s) is an open type.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>A <em>closed type</em> is a type that is not an open type.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Therefore <code>T</code>, <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code>, and <code>Dictionary&lt;string,T&gt;</code>, and <code>Dictionary&lt;T,U&gt;</code> are all open types (<code>T</code> and <code>U</code> are type arguments) whereas <code>List&lt;int&gt;</code> and <code>Dictionary&lt;string,int&gt;</code> are closed types. </p>

<p>There's a related concept: An <em>unbound generic type</em> is a generic type with unspecified type arguments. An unbound type can't be used in expressions other than <code>typeof()</code> and you can't instantiate it or call its methods. For instance, <code>List&lt;&gt;</code> and <code>Dictionary&lt;,&gt;</code> are unbound types.</p>

<p>To clarify the subtle distinction between an open type and an unbound type:</p>

<pre><code>class Program {
   static void Main() { Test&lt;int&gt;(); }
   static void Test&lt;T&gt;() {
      Console.WriteLine(typeof(List&lt;T&gt;)); // Print out the type name
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you run this snippet, it'll print out</p>

<pre><code>System.Collections.Generic.List`1[System.Int32]
</code></pre>

<p>which is the CLR name for <code>List&lt;int&gt;</code>. It's clear at runtime that the type argument is <code>System.Int32</code>. This makes <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> a <em>bound</em> open type.</p>

<p>At runtime, you can use reflection to bind type arguments to unspecified type parameters of unbound generic types with the <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.type.makegenerictype.aspx""><code>Type.MakeGenericType</code> method</a>:</p>

<pre><code>Type unboundGenericList = typeof(List&lt;&gt;);
Type listOfInt = unboundGenericList.MakeGenericType(typeof(int));
if (listOfInt == typeof(List&lt;int&gt;))
     Console.WriteLine(""Constructed a List&lt;int&gt; type."");
</code></pre>

<p>You can check whether a type is an unbound generic type (<em>generic type definition</em>) from which you can construct bound types with the <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.type.isgenerictypedefinition.aspx""><code>Type.IsGenericTypeDefinition</code> property</a>:</p>

<pre><code>Console.WriteLine(typeof(Dictionary&lt;,&gt;).IsGenericTypeDefinition); // True
Console.WriteLine(typeof(Dictionary&lt;int,int&gt;).IsGenericTypeDefinition); // False
</code></pre>

<p>To get the unbound type from a constructed type at runtime, you can use the <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.type.getgenerictypedefinition.aspx""><code>Type.GetGenericTypeDefinition</code> method</a>.</p>

<pre><code>Type listOfInt = typeof(List&lt;int&gt;);
Type list = listOfInt.GetGenericTypeDefinition(); // == typeof(List&lt;&gt;)
</code></pre>

<p>Note that for a generic type, you can either have a completely unbound type definition, or a completely bound definition. You can't bind some type parameters and leave others unbound. For instance, you can't have <code>Dictionary&lt;int,&gt;</code> or <code>Dictionary&lt;,string&gt;</code>.</p>

<h3>Strong name does not prevent assemblies to be tampered with. You can manipulate a signed assembly and resign it with a new strong name.</h3>

"<p>Using <a href=""http://www.red-gate.com/products/reflector/"">reflector</a> I have noticed that <a href=""http://System.Linq.Enumerable.Count""><code>System.Linq.Enumerable.Count</code></a> method has a condition in it to optimize it for the case when the <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code> passed is in fact an <code>ICollection&lt;T&gt;</code>. If the cast succeeds the Count method does not need to iterate over every element, but can call the Count method of ICollection.</p>

<p>Based on this I was starting to think that <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code> can be used like a readonly view of a collection, without having the performance loss that I originally expected based on the API of <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code></p>

<p>I was interested whether the optimization of the <code>Count</code> still holds when the <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code> is a result of a <code>Select</code> statement over an <code>ICollection</code>, but based on reflected code this case is not optimized, and requires an iteration through all elements.</p>

<p>Do you draw the same conclusions from reflector? What could be the reason behind the lack of this optimization? I seems like there is a lot of time wasted in this common operation. Does the spec <em>require</em> that the each element is evaluated even if the Count can be determined without doing that?</p>
","33708","","<p>It doesn't really matter that the result of <code>Select</code> is lazily evaluated. The <code>Count</code> is always equivalent to the count of the original collection so it could have certainly been retrieved directly by returning a specific object from <code>Select</code> that could be used to short-circuit evaluation of the <code>Count</code> method.</p>

<p>The reason it's not possible to optimize out evaluation of the <code>Count()</code> method on the return value of a <code>Select</code> call from something with determined count (like a <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code>) is that it could change the meaning of the program. </p>

<p>The <code>selector</code> function passed to <code>Select</code> method is allowed to <strong>have side effects</strong> and its side effects are required to happen deterministically, in a predetermined order.</p>

<p>Assume:</p>

<pre><code>new[]{1,2,3}.Select(i =&gt; { Console.WriteLine(i); return 0; }).Count();
</code></pre>

<p>The documentation requires this code to print </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1<br>
  2<br>
  3</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even though the count is really known from the start <em>and could be optimized</em>, optimization would change the behavior of the program. That's why you can't avoid enumeration of the collection anyway. That's exactly one of the reasons why compiler optimizations are much easier in pure functional languages.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Apparently, it's not clear that it's perfectly possible to implement <code>Select</code> and <code>Count</code> so that <code>Select</code>s on <code>ICollection&lt;T&gt;</code> will still be lazily evaluated but the <code>Count()</code> will be evaluated in O(1) without enumerating the collection.

"<h2>This is issue about LANGUAGE DESIGN.</h2>

<p>Please do not answer to the question until you read entire post! Thank you.</p>

<p>With all helpers existing in C# (like lambdas, or automatic properties) it is very odd for me that I cannot pass property by a reference. Let's say I would like to do that:</p>

<pre><code>foo(ref my_class.prop);
</code></pre>

<p>I get error so I write instead:</p>

<pre><code>{
   var tmp = my_class.prop;
   foo(tmp);
   my_class.prop = tmp;
}
</code></pre>

<p>And now it works. But please notice two things:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>it is general template, I didn't put anywhere type, only ""var"", so it applies for all types and number of properties I have to pass</p></li>
<li><p>I have to do it over and over again, with no benefit -- it is mechanical work</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The existing problem actually kills such useful functions as Swap. Swap is normally 3 lines long, but since it takes 2 references, calling it takes 5 lines. Of course it is nonsense and I simply write ""swap"" by hand each time I would like to call it. But this shows C# prevents reusable code, bad.</p>

<h2>THE QUESTION</h2>

<p>So -- what bad could happen if compiler automatically create temporary variables (as I do by hand), call the function, and assign the values back to properties? Is this any danger in it? I don't see it so I am curious what do you think why the design of this issue looks like it looks now.</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> As 280Z28 gave great examples for beating idea of automatically wrapping ref for properties I still think wrapping properties with temporary variables would be useful. Maybe something like this:</p>

<pre><code>Swap(inout my_class.prop1,inout my_class.prop2);
</code></pre>

<p>Otherwise no real Swap for C# :-(</p>
","33708","","<p>I'll provide just one simple example where it would cause confusion. Assume it was possible (as is in VB):</p>

   public int Prop { get; set; }

   x = 42;
   throw new Exception();
}

static void Main() { 
   int v = 10;
   try {
      Test(ref v);
   } catch {}
   Console.WriteLine(v); // prints 42

   var c = new Weird();
   c.Prop = 10;
   try {
      Test(ref c.Prop);
   } catch {}
   Console.WriteLine(c.Prop); // prints 10!!!

"<p>While writing some particularly complex exception handling code, someone asked, don't you need to make sure that your exception object isn't null?  And I said, of course not, but then decided to try it.  Apparently, you can throw null, but it is still turned into an exception somewhere.</p>

","33708","","<p>Because the language specification expects an expression of type <code>System.Exception</code> there (therefore, <code>null</code> is a valid in that context) and doesn't restrict this expression to be non-null. In general, there's no way it could detect whether the value of that expression is <code>null</code> or not. It would have to solve the halting problem. The runtime will have to deal with the <code>null</code> case anyway. See:</p>

<pre><code>Exception ex = null;
if (conditionThatDependsOnSomeInput) 
    ex = new Exception();
throw ex;

<p>They could, of course, make the specific case of throwing the <code>null</code> literal invalid but that wouldn't help much, so why waste specification space and reduce consistency for little benefit?</p>

<p><sub>Disclaimer (before I get slapped by Eric Lippert): This is <em>my own</em> speculation about the reasoning behind this design decision. Of course, I haven't been in the design meeting ;)</sub> </p>

<hr>

<p>The answer to your second question, whether an expression variable caught within a catch clause can ever be null: While the C# specification is silent about whether other languages can cause a <code>null</code> exception to be propagated, it does define the way exceptions are propagated:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The catch clauses, if any, are examined in order of appearance to locate a suitable handler for the exception. The first catch clause <strong>that specifies the exception type or a base type of the exception type</strong> is considered a match. A general catch clause is considered a match for any exception type. [...]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For <code>null</code>, the bold statement is false. So, while purely based on what the C# spec says, we can't say the underlying runtime won't ever throw null, we can be sure that even if that's the case, it'll be only handled by the generic <code>catch {}</code> clause.  </p>

<p>For C# implementations on the CLI, we can refer to the ECMA 335 specification. That document defines all exceptions that the CLI throws internally (none of which are <code>null</code>) and mentions that user defined exception objects are thrown by the <code>throw</code> instruction. The description for that instruction is virtually identical to C# <code>throw</code> statement (except that it doesn't restrict the type of the object to <code>System.Exception</code>): </p>

<blockquote>
  <h3>Description:</h3>
  
  <p>The <code>throw</code> instruction throws the exception object (type <code>O</code>) on the stack and empties the stack. For details of the exception mechanism, see Partition I.<br>
  [Note: While the CLI permits any object to be thrown, the CLS describes a specific exception class that shall be used for language interoperability. end note]  </p>
  
  <h3>Exceptions:</h3>
  
  <p><code>System.NullReferenceException</code> is thrown if <code>obj</code> is <code>null</code>.</p>
  
  <h3>Correctness:</h3>
  
  <p>Correct CIL ensures that object is always either <code>null</code> or an object reference (i.e., of type <code>O</code>).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe these are sufficient to conclude caught exceptions are never <code>null</code>.</p>

","33708","","<p><code>Any</code> will have to call a delegate for every element it checks (an extra <code>callvirt</code> instruction which is unlikely to get inlined by the JIT). <code>Contains</code> only performs that check.

"<p>I've not had the Kernighan and Ritchie C reference in years, but I remember that there was a page in there that talked about how to enter characters that were unavailable to you.  (WAY back in the day, some keyboards lacked characters like "", ~, etc.)</p>

<p>To be clear, let me give an example.  I'm <strong><em>not</em></strong> looking for a way to get quotes in strings, but rather, I want to replace this:</p>

<pre><code>printf(""foo"");
</code></pre>

<p>with this:</p>

<pre><code>printf([alternate sequence]foo[alternate sequence]);
</code></pre>

<p>For the curious, I have an automated process that involves generating C/C++ code, but the (closed source) commercial tool involved strips quotes in its data streams and the documentation is quite clear on the fact that they do not provide a way to escape them. </p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Wow, I hadn't expected such a heavy response.  This might merit a little more detail on my process.  I'm doing automated build systems, which means that I live with certain restrictions when it comes to changing the code I'm compiling.  For now, we have to live with the assumption that I have to get a string, spaces and all, into a preprocessor definiton.  I already went down the <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2016697/msbuild-exe-not-accepting-either-pdefineconstants-nor-ppreprocessordefinition"">'PreprocessorDefinition' road</a>.  This left me with my usual fallback:  Define the string in the operating environment and have the project file set the definition from there:</p>

<pre><code>Preprocessor Definitions     WIN32;_DEBUG;THINGIE=$(THINGIE)
</code></pre>

<p>The hope was that I could get around MSVC's stripping of quotes in anything handed to the build with /D using a trigraph, by doing something like this in my build automation script:</p>

<pre><code>ENV['THINGIE'] = ""??''Yodeling Monkey Nuggets??''""
run_msbuild_command
</code></pre>

<p>I guess it's time for a plan C.</p>

"<p>I recently noticed the following code which basically defines a class method</p>

<pre><code>public Func&lt;string, string&gt; SampleMethod = inputParam =&gt;

<p>which is the same as doing it in the old fashioned way </p>

<pre><code>public string SampleMethod(string inputParam ) 
{
    return inputParam.ToUpper();

<p>My question - why would I prefer the first over the second? My eyes are maybe more trained to understand the second style quicker. I find it similar to the difference between SMS lingo and plain old english.</p>
","33708","","<p>Those two things are <strong>fundamentally different</strong>. The former is a <em>field</em> of a delegate type while the latter is really a method. The tiniest difference I can think of is that you can modify the first one dynamically at runtime and assign another method reference to it while the second is fixed.</p>

<p>You shouldn't normally prefer the first over the second if your purpose is to write a simple method for a class in C#.</p>

<p>An example that makes the first extremely fragile:</p>

<pre><code>var c = new SomeClass();
c.SampleMethod = inputParam =&gt; inputParam.ToLower();
c.DoSomeTaskThatReliesOnSampleMethodReturningAnUpperCaseString();
c.SampleMethod = null;
c.DoSomeTaskThatCallsSampleMethod(); // NullReferenceException

"<p>I'm a little confused as to the mechanics of the copy constructor. Correct me if I'm wrong: </p>

<p>If a method takes a reference to an object as a parameter, and the class defines a copy construtor, then the class uses the constructor to create a copy of itself and that gets passed to the function instead of a reference to the original object? </p>

<p>Furthermore, one can call </p>

<pre><code>Object * obj = new Object(&amp;anotherObject);
</code></pre>

<p>to create a copy of anotherObject? </p>
","33708","","<p><strong>If a method takes a reference to an object as a parameter</strong>, copy constructor will not be called. If that was the case, then a call to the copy constructor itself would have resulted in an infinite loop (since it takes a reference as an argument).</p>

<p>That line is not a valid way to call a copy constructor. It expects a reference as an argument, not a pointer.</p>

"<p>Given the next code snippet:</p>

<p>...</p>

<pre><code>- (void) setTotalAmount: (NSNumber*)input
{
    [totalAmount autorelease];
    totalAmount = [input retain];
}

- (void) dealloc
{
    [totalAmount release];
    [super dealloc];
}
</code></pre>

<p>...</p>

<p>What I want to understand how really we set value.
We allocate local (instance) var and ""retain"" to input var. But what is ""input""? Is it a pointer to real value? Or is it value itself?
When we ""retain"" do we get a pointer to ""input"" or pointer to value or just the value?</p>

<p>And pretty same questions with dealloc and release. What actually ""dies"" here?</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>
","33708","","<p>It's clear that <code>input</code> is a pointer. You have declared its type in the argument list as <code>NSNumber*</code>. </p>

<p><code>input</code> is a pointer to an object of type <code>NSNumber</code>. Internally, the object has an integer variable that holds the number of external references to it. Sending the <code>retain</code> message to an object will increment its reference count. Sending the <code>release</code> message will decrement the count. Sending the <code>autorelease</code> message will adds the object to the local autorelease pool which will keep track of autoreleased objects and sends the <code>release</code> message to them next time it drains. An object with reference count of 1 that receives a <code>release</code> message will get deallocated and its <code>dealloc</code> method will get called. You should release all the resources you hold when you are deallocated.</p>

<p>When you are setting a property, you want to release the old value and make sure the new value is kept around as long as the object itself is alive. To make sure the new value is kept around, you increment its reference count by 1 by sending it the <code>retain</code> message. To release the old object, you'll send it the release message. There's one subtle issue here. If the old value is the same as the new value, if you release the old value first and its retain count was 1, it'll get destroyed before you can increment it. That's why you should retain the new value before releasing the old one.</p>

"<p><em>Disclaimer: My posts are apparently always verbose. If you happen to know the answer to the title question, feel free to just answer it without reading my extended discussion below.</em></p>

<hr>

<p>The <code>System.Threading.Interlocked</code> class provides some very useful methods to assist in writing thread-safe code. One of the more complex methods is <code>CompareExchange</code>, which can be used for computing a running total that may be updated from multiple threads.</p>

<p>Since the use of <code>CompareExchange</code> is a bit tricky, I thought it a rather common-sense idea to provide some helper methods for it:</p>

<pre><code>// code mangled so as not to require horizontal scrolling
// (on my monitor, anyway)
public static double Aggregate
(ref double value, Func&lt;double, double&gt; aggregator) {
    double initial, aggregated;

    do {
        initial = value;
        aggregated = aggregator(initial);
    } while (
        initial != Interlocked.CompareExchange(ref value, aggregated, initial)
    );

    return aggregated;
}

public static double Increase(ref double value, double amount) {
    return Aggregate(ref value, delegate(double d) { return d + amount; });
}

public static double Decrease(ref double value, double amount) {
    return Aggregate(ref value, delegate(double d) { return d - amount; });
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, perhaps I am just guilty of being generic-happy (I will admit, this is often true); but it does feel silly <strong>to me</strong> to restrict the functionality provided by the above methods to <code>double</code> values only (or, more accurately, for me to have to write overloaded versions of the above methods for every type I want to support). Why can't I do this?</p>

<pre><code>// the code mangling continues...
public static T Aggregate&lt;T&gt;
(ref T value, Func&lt;T, T&gt; aggregator) where T : IEquatable&lt;T&gt; {
    T initial, aggregated;

    do {
        initial = value;
        aggregated = aggregator(initial);
    } while (
        !initial.Equals(
            Interlocked.CompareExchange&lt;T&gt;(ref value, aggregated, initial)
        )
    );
}
</code></pre>

<p>I can't do this because <code>Interlocked.CompareExchange&lt;T&gt;</code> apparently has a <code>where T : class</code> constraint, and <strong>I don't understand why</strong>. I mean, <em>maybe</em> it's because there are already overloads for <code>CompareExchange</code> that accept <code>Int32</code>, <code>Int64</code>, <code>Double</code>, etc.; but that hardly seems a good rationale. In my case, for example, it would be quite handy to be able to use the <code>Aggregate&lt;T&gt;</code> method to perform a wide range of atomic calculations.</p>
","33708","","<p><code>Interlocked.CompareExchange</code> is meant to be implemented with native atomic instructions provided directly by the processor. It's pointless to have something like that use a <code>lock</code> internally (it's designed for lock-free scenarios). </p>

<p>Processors that provide atomic compare exchange instruction naturally support it as small, ""register-sized"" operations (e.g. the largest compare-exchange instruction on an Intel x64 processor is <code>cmpxchg16b</code> that works on 128 bit values). </p>

<p>An arbitrary value type can be potentially bigger than that and compare-exchanging it may not be possible with a single instruction. Compare-exchanging a reference type is easy. Regardless of its total size in memory, you'll be comparing and copying a small pointer of a known size. This is also true for primitive types like <code>Int32</code> and <code>Double</code>&mdash;all of them are small.</p>

<p>The way you are saving the stream to disk is wrong. You are treating the stream as a character sequence, which corrupts the ZIP file in the process. Open a <code>FileStream</code> instead of a <code>StreamWriter</code> and copy the <code>GetResponseStream()</code> return value directly to that <code>FileStream</code> using something like <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/444309/what-would-be-the-fastest-way-to-concatenate-three-files-in-c/444316#444316"">my <code>CopyStream</code> function from here</a>.</p>

"<p>What is the most appropriate data type for storing currency values in VB.NET?</p>
","33708","","<p><code>Decimal</code> (alias for <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.decimal.aspx""><code>System.Decimal</code> structure</a> in the BCL) is designed for storing monetary values. It's a 128 bit decimal floating point type (as opposed to binary floating point) and is useful for storing ""real-world"" values with high decimal precision. By real-world, I specifically mean measurements that are originally made in decimal. Double is generally suitable for calculations that don't need as much accuracy when they are represented as decimal numbers.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Decimal value type represents decimal numbers ranging from positive 79,228,162,514,264,337,593,543,950,335 to negative 79,228,162,514,264,337,593,543,950,335. The Decimal value type is appropriate for <strong>financial calculations requiring large numbers of significant integral and fractional digits and no round-off errors</strong>. The Decimal type does not eliminate the need for rounding. Rather, it minimizes errors due to rounding. For example, the following code produces a result of 0.9999999999999999999999999999 rather than 1.</p>

"<p>I've been an admirer of Juval Lowy's teaching and guidance in .NET development for a number of years.  He's also written one of my favorite books: Programming .NET Components.  </p>

<p>However on a recent DotNet Rocks podcast (Jan 2010) in discussing WCF/COM and .NET, he made some comments that greatly surprised me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Juval Löwy:</strong> ..... <strong>in .NET, lo
  and behold, every class here is a COM
  object. We know that.</strong> In fact, it's much more than COM because we've
  got the git compiling, we've got garbage collection,
  we've got the Security Stack....</p>
  
  <p><strong>Carl Franklin:</strong> Well, you should clarify that
  though. I mean, every
  object is not a COM object. Every
  object has the capabilities that a COM
  object does, but the .NET Framework
  isn't a COM library.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Juval Löwy:</strong>  No, no.  First of all .NET is actually built on
  top of COM. It's all COM underneath.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then, after Carl Franklin asks for clarification on this comment:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Carl Franklin:</strong> Yeah, I get that. My
  question was is .NET built on COM?</p>
  
  <p><strong>Juval Löwy:</strong> Of course, it all COM
  underneath.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Carl Franklin:</strong> No. I know it's
  intertwined and it's required, but
  when you new up a .NET object you're
  not creating a COM object. </p>
  
  <p><strong>Juval Löwy:</strong> You're creating a .NET object, but all
  I'm saying is that .NET is built
  underneath. It's all C++ and COM. </p>
  
  <p><strong>Carl Franklin:</strong> It is C++ but you're not
  registering a COM object through the
  COM interface. It isn't all that stuff
  unless you specifically do that. </p>
  
  <p><strong>Juval Löwy:</strong> But some of the stuff is using
  COM underneath, but that's beside the
  point. Forget about how it's made.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How do you read these comments?</p>

<p>While I understand (and have confirmed) that some of the System assemblies are written in unmanaged C++, is it also valid to say that they are ""all COM underneath""?  </p>

","33708","","<p>I answer your question with another question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why <code>finalize</code> method shouldn't be protected?</p>

<p>In general, you should try to keep things as much private as possible. That's what encapsulation is all about. Otherwise, you could make <em>everything</em> <code>public</code>. <code>finalize</code> can't be <code>private</code> (since derived classes should be able to access it to be able to override it), so it should at least be <code>protected</code> but why give out more access when it's not desirable?</p>

<hr>

<p>After reading your comment more carefully, I guess I see your main point now. I think your point is since everything derives from <code>java.lang.Object</code> and consequently accesses its <code>protected</code> members, it wouldn't make any difference for it (or any method in <code>java.lang.Object</code> for that matter) to be <code>public</code> as opposed to <code>protected</code>. Personally, I'd count this as a design flaw in Java. This is indeed fixed in C#. The problem is not why <code>finalize</code> is protected. That's OK. The real issue is that you shouldn't be able to call protected methods in the base class through an object reference of the base class type.

<p>When you are dealing with an assignment to an <em>already declared</em> variable, you are using this form of the <code>using</code> statement. The fact that you are <em>assigning a value to a variable</em> like</p>

<pre><code>using ( x = something )
</code></pre>

<p>is irrelevant. The whole <code>x = something</code> is treated as an expression and only the value of that expression is what matters. It's important to know that ""resource variable"" is not ""x"" here. It's an invisible variable. From the compiler's perspective, there's not much difference between the following constructs:</p>

<pre><code>using ( something ) 
using ( x = something )
using ( y = x = something )
</code></pre>

<p>In all cases, the expression will get executed and <strong>the value</strong> is what will get guaranteed disposal, not the variable. What would the compiler supposed to do if this wasn't the defined behavior and you had written the third line in the above block? Dispose <code>x</code>? <code>y</code>? both? neither? The current behavior makes sense.</p>

"<p>I noticed that there is no reference to reference but there is pointer to pointer, and also there is no an array of references but an array of pointers.</p>

<p>Could anybody give me any reason?</p>
","33708","","<p>A reference is an abstraction at the language level. It's an opaque way of aliasing a variable to another. While under the hood, the compiler is likely to work out references using pointers, they are very different things at a higher level. On the other hand, pointers are explicitly used by a programmer to achieve indirection. A pointer variable is a distinct variable from what it's pointed to. A reference should be thought as if it's simply an alias to the original variable, not as if it's yet another variable holding an address. Consequently, an alias for an alias of a variable would simply be an alias to the variable itself. Considering the binding a reference to a variable is a compile-time thing may help understanding the rationale behind this behavior.</p>

<p>With this reasoning, you can argue that since arrays are structures that store values, not variables, it doesn't make sense for them to be able to store aliases of variables. Basically, a reference variable (by which I mean the pointer, if exists, that <em>may</em> be used by the compiler to wire up the reference) is invisible to the programmer at the C++ level. If it was possible to declare arrays of references, the compiler probably needed to require constant indexes passed to the arrays to be able to resolve the binding at compile time.</p>

<p><strong>As long as you haven't changed</strong> the <code>highScoresArray</code> pointer to point to another object, releasing it will be the same as releasing <code>scoresArray</code>. </p>

[highScoresArray release]; // same as `[scoresArray release];`

// ... Now make `highScoresArray` point to another object ...
highScoresArray = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init];
// Now you should release both as they point to different objects.
[highScoresArray release];

","33708","","<p>One potential issue with this design is that the view might iterate through the model objects (that are lazy loaded) more than once and cause an unnecessary overhead.

The view could deal with this problem by caching the results once and loop twice on the cached data, but this is not what a view should deal with. It should present the data given to it without worrying about these stuff.</p>

"<p>In the data structures class that I am currently taking, we have been tasked with writing a web crawler in C++. To give us a head start, the professor provided us with a program to get the source from a given URL and a simple HTML parser to strip the tags out. The main function for this program accepts arguments and so uses argc/argv. The code used to check for the arguments is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>// Process the arguments
if (!strcmp(option, ""-h""))
{
    // do stuff...
}
else if (!strcmp(option, """"))
{

{
    exit(1);

<p>It could be that my C++ is somewhat rusty, but I seem to recall *argv being equivalent to argv[0], basically meaning it is checking to make sure arguments exist.

It occurs to me that argv[0] could be null if argc is equal to 0, but searching around on Google I couldn't find a single post determining whether or not that is even possible.</p>

"<p>In some library I create I have to use following cast:</p>

{
    List&lt;double&gt; doublesList = uintsList.Cast&lt;double&gt;().ToList();
    // Do something with the doublesList

<li>What could cause this exception occured? Isn't the cast uint->double always valid?</li>
<li>How can I secure my algorithm to avoid this exception? </li>

","33708","","<p><code>.Cast</code> method is not meant to perform type conversion like that. It just performs conversions in the inheritance hierarchy. </p>

<p>The reason for this behavior is that the extension method signature takes an <code>IEnumerable</code> and not <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code>. Consequently, getting the <code>Current</code> property of the enumerator returns an <code>object</code> to the <code>Cast</code> method. Of course, you can't unbox a value type of one type to another type directly. Basically, <code>Cast</code> will do something like:</p>

<p>The distinction here is a result of the fact that C++ is a statically typed language. The static type of the variable is what the compiler cares about when it's verifying things like method calls. Since the static type of the variable <code>a</code> is <code>Animal</code> which doesn't have a <code>Fly</code> method, the compiler will not allow you to call <code>Fly</code> on it (not all animals are able to fly, so you'll have to explicitly cast to <code>Bird</code>: <code>dynamic_cast&lt;Bird*&gt;(a)-&gt;Fly()</code> is legal).  </p>

<p>The expression <code>new Bird</code> will have the type <code>Bird*</code>. If you assign a value of a derived type to a variable of a based type, the compiler will not complain (all <code>Bird</code>s are <code>Animal</code>s, so it should always work). Basically, the compiler upcasts <code>Bird*</code> to <code>Animal*</code>. The reverse is not true. Not all <code>Animal</code>s are <code>Bird</code>s, so you'll have to take the responsibility and do the cast explicitly and tell the compiler that I know that object is really a <code>Bird*</code>.

","33708","","<p>Well, you can traverse the list to calculate the count pretty easily. Obviously the total memory will be equal to the number of items multiplied by size of each item (<code>sizeof(Data_Struct)</code>).</p>

<p>Of course, this will be the size of the linked list itself and doesn't include the memory allocated for the strings. A pointer doesn't have any information about the amount of allocated memory it refers to, so strictly speaking, you can't calculate the amount of total memory allocated directly by just looking at a linked list like that. Additionally, there may be duplicate pointers in the linked list you will need to keep track of. That said, assuming all pointer are unique, you can calculate the number of chars in each item by summing up return values of <code>strlen</code> calls on each pointer as you are traversing the list (which should be pretty straightforward).</p>

Like other places in C#, expression statements in a block are restricted to declarations, assignments, function call, increment, and decrement. Merely applying operator <code>==</code> to a couple identifiers doesn't the expression a valid statement. The second issue is that when the return type of a method (anonymous or not) is not <code>void</code>, all code paths reaching the end of the block should return a value. Consequently, even if the body of your lambda was syntactically valid, without a return statement, your lambda would be convertible to <code>Action&lt;T&gt;</code>, and not <code>Func&lt;T, bool&gt;</code> that <code>Where</code> method expects. </p>

<p>Of course, the <code>x =&gt; { return x.objectID == paramObjectID; }</code> variant of your lambda expression is <em>only possible</em> when it's supposed to be converted to an <strong>anonymous method</strong>, not an <strong>expression tree</strong>.  That is, a lambda with a <em>block</em> body is not convertible to <code>Expression&lt;T&gt;</code>. That's why you can use it in LINQ to Objects (in which <code>Where</code> takes <code>Func&lt;T, bool&gt;</code>) but you can't use it in LINQ to SQL (in which <code>Where</code> takes <code>Expression&lt;Func&lt;T, bool&gt;&gt;</code>).</p>

","33708","","<p>The lambda expression <code>(o, e) =&gt; { fCount++; Console.WriteLine(fCount); }</code> is interpreted as an <em>anonymous method</em> that takes two arguments <code>o, e</code> (whose types are inferred from the delegate type used for <code>MyEvent</code> and returns <code>void</code>. It <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1095707/what-is-the-exact-definition-of-a-closure/1095770#1095770""><em>captures</em></a> the <code>fCount</code> variable in the body of the enclosing method (if it's a local variable). The <code>+=</code> operator will subscribe the anonymous method to the event and the <code>-=</code> unsubscribes a delegate from an event.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Update (re: concerns about delegate instance equality):</h3>

<p>It's important to know that it's not a good idea to try to unsubscribe from the event like that. The language specification, permits, but doesn't require that the delegate in the second line to be equal to the delegate from the first line. That is, the compiler is allowed to treat the two anonymous function bodies as if it was the same function or if it wasn't (because the anonymous function body is semantically identical and the set of captured variables is equal too). Even if it works as expected in your compiler, it might break in the next version. To quote the C# Language Specification on that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h3>C# Language Specification (Section 7.9.8 Delegate equality operators):</h3>
  
  <p>Invocation list entries produced from evaluation of semantically identical <em>anonymous-function-expressions</em> with the same (possibly empty) set of captured outer variable instances are permitted (but not required) to be equal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the compiler treats the two anonymous function expressions as equal, the second line will unsubscribe the previous anonymous method from the event. If it doesn't the second line will not do anything special (it's not an error to unsubscribe a delegate from an event invocation list if it doesn't already exist in the list).</p>

"<p>I have a linq to objects query in a recursive loop and afraid when the objects approach more then 1000 and a have more then 100 users on the site -- my website will break. so is it possible to compile a linq to objects query. </p>

<p>The linq query does nothing more then find the direct children of a node. </p>
","33708","","<p>To see why the concept of <em>compilation</em> doesn't really make sense for LINQ to Object queries, it's useful to understand how LINQ is implemented.  First, it should be clear that LINQ queries written in fluent syntax are converted to the equivalent method call syntax at <em>compile time</em> by the C# compiler regardless of the variant of LINQ you're using:</p>

<pre><code>from person in people
where person.Age &lt; 18
select person.Name
// will be converted to:
people.Where(person =&gt; person.Age &lt; 18).Select(person =&gt; person.Name)
</code></pre>

<p>From now on, the LINQ query is basically a set of method calls taking some arguments and usually transforming an <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code> object to another <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code> object. Deferred execution, which is a different from compilation, is simply achieved by not taking any object from the original <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code> until you're traversing the output <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code>. Basically, methods with deferred execution are operating on their arguments symbolically without touching the original collection, building up a generator that queries stuff as you like.</p>

<p>With that in mind, take a look at the lambda expression <code>person =&gt; person.Age &lt; 18</code> in the above expression. It takes a <code>Person</code> object and returns a <code>bool</code>. Lambda expressions are untyped; they can be treated as expression trees or anonymous methods depending on the context their type is inferred from. In this case, the type is inferred from the parameter type of the <code>Where</code> extension method. This is where the distinction of LINQ to SQL and LINQ to Object comes up. In LINQ to Objects, the <code>Where</code> method simply takes <code>Func&lt;Person, bool&gt;</code> as opposed to <code>Expression&lt;Func&lt;Person, bool&gt;&gt;</code>. This essentially means that in LINQ to Objects, the C# compiler compiles the lambda expression down to an anonymous method and generates the IL at <em>compile time</em> and passes a delegate to that method to <code>Where</code>. </p>

<p>In other LINQ flavors, like LINQ to SQL, the lambda is <em>not</em> compiled to IL. Instead, the compiler builds up an expression tree object out of the lambda expression and passes the expression tree to LINQ methods. LINQ methods use these expression trees to build up a model for querying stuff. When the query is being run, the object model built to represent the query using the expression trees will be transformed to another thing (depending on the LINQ variant used) like SQL statements in LINQ to SQL in order to get executed on the database. This transformation process is done at runtime and it's what we call <em>compilation of LINQ queries</em>. </p>

<p>To sum up, the question is compile to <em>what</em>? The reason LINQ to Object doesn't need compilation at runtime is that it's not in expression tree format in the first place; it's already IL.  </p>

<p>You almost never need to worry about the performance of LINQ to Objects in comparison to normal looping.</p>

<p>I haven't tested this out, seeing as I have not implemented my authentication code. However, this looks like a big problem to me, since I do not have a default.aspx in my project!</p>

<p>My authentication tag in the web.config looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;authentication mode=""Forms""&gt;
   &lt;forms loginUrl=""~/Account/LogOn"" defaultUrl=""~/Home/Index"" timeout=""2880""/&gt;
&lt;/authentication&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Why doesn't it pick up this route as the default ReturnUrl instead of default.aspx?</p>
","33708","","<p>ASP.NET (to be precise, <code>FormsAuthentication.RedirectFromLoginPage</code>) always ignores the <code>defaultUrl</code> setting in <code>web.config</code> when a <code>ReturnUrl</code> parameter is present. It's only honored when you go directly to the login page without passing any <code>ReturnUrl</code> parameters.</p>

<p>ASP.NET MVC project template provides a blank <code>Default.aspx</code> template to handle requests like that in IIS Classic pipeline mode. You should be fine with that.</p>

"<p>I'm facing a situation where I have dependent objects and I would like to be able to remove an object and all references to it.</p>

<p>Say I have an object structure like the code below, with a Branch type which references two Nodes. </p>

<pre><code>public class Node
{
    // Has Some Data!
}

public class Branch
{
    // Contains references to Nodes
    public Node NodeA
    public Node NodeB
}

public class Graph
{
    public List&lt;Node&gt; Nodes;
    public List&lt;Branch&gt; Branches;
}
</code></pre>

<p>If I remove a Node from the Nodes list in the Graph class, it is still possible that one or more Branch objects still contains a reference to the removed Node, thus retaining it in memory, whereas really what I would quite like would be to set any references to the removed Node to null and let the garbage collection kick in.</p>

<p>Other than enumerating through each Branch and checking each Node reference sequentially, are there any smart ideas on how I remove references to the Node in each Branch instance AND indeed any other class which reference the removed Node? </p>
","33708","","<p>There's no built-in C# language feature to facilate that (you can't really track assignments). You'll have to keep track of all references somewhere and update it as soon as you're assigning a new reference to it. A very general idea is to provide a <code>Removed</code> event in the <code>Node</code> itself and raise the event when the object is supposed to be abandoned. Every time you want to hold on a new reference to the <code>Node</code>, you'd subscribe to the event with a matching delegate that nulls out the reference to that object. 
Of course, if you're doing this with a set of previously known types that reference the node in a specific way, there may be easier and more efficient ways to accomplish the task.</p>

How can I let it read and write and the same time.
Using <code>fstream file(""file.txt', ios::out | ios::in );</code> doesn't create a file, in the first place. But supposing the file exists, I am unable to use to do reading and writing simultaneously.

<p>Shouldn't the file's contents now be <code>101010</code> ? Read one character and then overwrite the next one with 0 ? Or incase the entire contents were read at once into some buffer, should there not be atleast one 0 in the file ? <code>1111110</code> ?
But the contents remain unaltered. Please explain.

","33708","","<p>While you haven't posted the actual code causing the error (<code>Opdr2_AvlTreeTest_Final.AvlTreeNode</code>) yet, I strongly suspect the problem is that you are using this class in a generic method/type with a type parameter that's not constrained to implement <code>IComparable&lt;T&gt;</code>.</p>

<pre><code>// no problem here at definition site:

   return a.CompareTo(b) &gt; 0;

"<p>Does anyone know what C# compiler does under the hood with the following code?</p>

    { 1, ""value1"" },

","33708","","<p>It'll call the <code>Add</code> method on the object with the values as arguments:</p>

__temp.Add(1, ""value1"");
__temp.Add(2, ""value2"");
dict = __temp;
</code></pre>

<p>The name <code>Add</code> is hardcoded (specified in the C# spec: <strong><em>7.5.10.3</strong>: Collection initializers</em>). The number of arguments to the method is not limited. It just has to match the number of parameters of the method. Any collection (implementing <code>IEnumerable</code> interface) that provides an <code>Add</code> method can be used like that.</p>

<p>To further clarify, no, the compiler doesn't really care that the class is a <code>Dictionary</code> to create a <code>KeyValuePair</code> and pass that to <code>Add</code>. It simply generates a sequence of calls to the <code>Add</code> method passing all the arguments in each collection item in each call. The <code>Add</code> method is responsible for the rest. </p>

"<p>I am revising for the MCTS example and am on a small section regarding Culture-Insensitive comparisons.  I get the principle, you don't two items which are the same (i.e dates) but are displayed differently and hence are pragmatically marked as different.</p>

<p>However call me stupid but I am finding it hard to see where I can use it is practice, for example why would you have two different date times, in the same code, in which they are different cultures? The only way to do so would be if you manually override the one of the datatypes cultures and why would you do that?</p>

<p>Any example of a real-world application of culturally insensitive comparisons? </p>

<p>Cheers</p>
","33708","","<p>You may want to compare a user input (which can be in different cultures) with a reference string set in code.</p>

<p>One of the classic use-cases for culture invariant comparisons is the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dotted_and_dotless_I"" rel=""nofollow"">Turkish-I problem</a>.
Assume that you have a textbox in your application that validates a URL protocol by checking whether it starts with <code>http://</code>, <code>ftp://</code>, or <code>file://</code>. If you write:</p>

<pre><code>inputUrl.StartsWith(""FILE://"", StringComparison.CurrentCultureIgnoreCase)
</code></pre>

<p>and the user input is <code>file://test</code>, it'll work on a machine with English regional settings (more accurately, the thread's <code>CurrentCulture</code>) but the test will fail if the culture is set to Turkish because the uppercase version of <code>file://</code> will be <code>FİLE://</code> in Turkish alphabet.</p>

<p>In these cases, we want to match the string using invariant culture:</p>

<pre><code>inputUrl.StartsWith(""FILE://"", StringComparison.InvariantCultureIgnoreCase)
</code></pre>

<p>In general, when you want to perform comparisons for input data where the input has specific semantics in your program (it represents a URL, resource key, ...) rather than simply being used for display purposes or storage and retrieval, you should consider using <code>InvariantCulture</code>.  </p>

","33708","","<p>You don't need to use any fancy ""web service"" technology to upload data from a client application to a server. You can create a simple ASP.NET Web handler and save the input file from the request body:</p>

<pre><code>public class FileUploader : IHttpHandler
{
    public void ProcessRequest(HttpContext context)
    {
       string fileName = context.Request.QueryString[""FileName""];
       byte[] fileData = context.Request.BinaryRead(context.Request.ContentLength);
       string path = ...; // decide where you want to save the file
       File.WriteAllBytes(path, fileData);
    }

    public bool IsReusable
    {
        get { return false; }
    }
}

}

"<p>Since I started iPhone/iPod Development I have come across some differences between how the simulator and how real device react.

<p>So here is what I came across.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Simulator is not case sensitive, Devices are case sensitive.</p>

<li>This means a default.png or Icon.png will work in simulator, but not on a device where they must be named Default.png and icon.png (if it's still not working read <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2233860/iphone-splash-default-png-displays-on-simulator-but-not-the-iphone/2982007#2982007"">this answer</a>)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Simulator has different codecs to play audio and video</p>

<ul>
<li>If you use f.e. MPMoviePlayerController you might play certain video on the simulator while on the device it won't work
(use Handbrake->presets->iPhone &amp; iPod Touch to create playable videos for Simulator and Device).</li>
<li>If you play audio with AudioServicesPlaySystemSound(&amp;soundID) you might here the sound on simulator but not an a device. (use Audacity to open your soundfile, export as wav and run afconvert -f caff -d LEI16@44100 -c 1 audacity.wav output.caf in terminal)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Also there is this flickering on second run problem which can be resolved with an<br>
playerViewCtrl.initialPlaybackTime = -1.0;<br>
either on the end of playing or before each beginning.</p></li>
<li><p>Simulator is mostly much faster cause it doesn't simulate the hardware but uses Mac resources, therefore f.e. sio2 Apps (OpenGL,OpenAL,etc. framework) run much better on simulator, well everything that uses more resources will run visibly better in simulator than on device.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I hope we can add some more to this.</p>
","33708","","<p>Just to clarify your first point:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Simulator is not case sensitive, Devices are case sensitive</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Being case-sensitive or not in that sense is not a characteristic of simulator. It's a characteristic of the underlying filesystem. The filesystem on device is case sensitive HFS+ while the file system on the Mac is likely to be case insensitive (by default). If the application runs on a case sensitive HFS+ partition, it'll become case sensitive when it comes to loading files from disk even when it runs in the simulator.</p>

What exactly, do you ask? I´ll tell you right away, I use C as a example:</p>

<p>1: Stack local scope memory allocation:</p>

<p>So, typical local memory allocation uses stack. Just copy esp to ebp and than allocate all the memory via ebp. OK, I would understand this if you explicitly need allocate RAM by default stack values, but if I do understand it correctly, modern OS use paging as a translation layer between application and physical RAM, when address you desire is further translated before reaching actual RAM byte. So why don´t just say 0x00000000 is int a,0x00000004 is int b and so? And access them just by mov 0x00000000,#10? Because you wont actually access memory blocks 0x00000000 and 0x00000004 but those your OS set the paging tables to. Actually, since memory allocation by ebp and esp use indirect addressing, ""my"" way would be even faster.</p>

<p>2: Variable allocation duplicity:</p>

<p>When you run application, Loader load its code into RAM. When you create variable, or string, compiler generates code that pushes these values on the top o stack when created in main. So there is actual instruction for do so, and that actual number in memory. So, there are 2 entries of the same value in RAM. One in form of instruction, second in form of actual bytes in the RAM. But why? Why not to just when declaring variable count at which memory block it would be, than  when used, just insert this memory location?</p>
","33708","","<p>How would you implement recursive functions? What you are describing is equivalent to using global variables everywhere.</p>

<p>That's just one problem. How can you link to a precompiled object file and be sure it won't corrupt the memory of your procedures?</p>

"<p>I've got a simple ASHX handler that returns an dynamically generated image; the image is generated from a custom created class, and an object belonging to this class is passed to the handler using Session (I'd rather avoid using QueryString).</p>

<p>The handler is used as the URL of an image on a ASP form which is very simple: a drop down list, a button and an image. Basically, depending on what the user selects from the list, the appropriate image will be generated once the button is pressed.</p>

<p>At the start the actual image has it's Visible property set to false; I don't want the handler to display anything before the data is all there.</p>

<p>Once the button is pressed, the required Session parameter is added containing the necessary object, and the page is refreshed using Server.Transfer. When the Page_load method detects that the Session parameter has been correctly set, it sets the Visible parameter on the image to true.</p>

<p>After that the handler fires up and generates the image.</p>

<p>So far so good... However, if the user now picks something different from the list and presses the button, despite the correct object being passed in the Session, the image won't be updated. In fact, the handler won't even fire up (if I put a breakpoint in there). I need to close the browser window and reopen it for it to work.</p>

For boolean types, where both of them can be applied, the difference is in the ""short-circuiting"" property of <code>&amp;&amp;</code>.

"<p>It is said that by using C/C++, one can write 'native' programs - that run on the platform. I am confused about what is considered native - the processor architecture or the OS version?</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>I have a 32 bit processor and Windows 7 ( 32 bit ), and I compile and generate and .exe file. Is it guaranteed to run on any Windows 7 32 Bit? ( Win 7 32 bit on 32/64 Bit machines )</p>

<p><strong>Edit1</strong>:
I did not intend only Windows OS here. My example can be extended to Linux also. For example, generating an executable ( by default <code>a.out</code> ) on a 32 bit Linux OS running on 32 bit processor, and then running it on a 32bit Linux on a 64 bit processor.</p>

<p><strong>Edit2</strong>:
Thanks for the responses, but I also intended that I am using the standard libraries and functions - nothing OS Specific. Just the once specified by the ANSI or ISO C++ Standard. No references to OS specific windowing systems or other libraries.
Thanks</p>
","33708","","<p>Both; kind of.</p>

<p>The actual instructions don't really differ across Windows and Linux as they are compiled down for a single CPU architecture (x86).</p>

<p>However, a binary is more than just code that runs on bare hardware.  For instance, it also contains information that tells the operating system how to load the executable and its dependencies.  The binary is packaged in a specific format.  This format can be different in different operating systems.</p>

<p>Besides that, the operating system provides some services to the applications (through system calls and APIs).  The services that operating systems provide, and the way they can be used varies from an operating system to another.</p>

<p>These reasons contribute to the fact that most of the time a native binary depends on both OS and CPU architecture it's compiled for.</p>

<hr>

<p>Answer to the updated question:</p>

<p>C++ Standard doesn't require anything about the nature of the compiled target.  It just specifies compatibility requirements at the source level.  Consequently, if you stick to the standard libraries, you'll be able to use the same <em>source code</em> to compile on platforms that offer a conforming C++ implementation.  The standard doesn't say anything about binary portability.  As I mentioned above, the primitive system calls that operating systems provide can vary and the actual implementation of the standard library depends on the way those system calls are provided by the OS.   </p>

<p>In order to run a Windows binary on Linux, you need to use some sort of emulation like Wine which understands Windows binary format and simulates Windows API for applications.</p>

"<p>Good morning,</p>

<p>I am writting a spell checker which, for the case, is performance-critical. That being, and since I am planning to connect to a DB and making the GUI using C#, I wrote an edit-distance calculation routine in C and compiled to a DLL which I use in C# using <code>DllImport</code>. The problem is that <em>I think</em> (though I am possibly wrong) that marshalling words one by one from <code>String</code> to <code>char *</code> is causing a lot of overhead. That being, I thought about using C++/CLI so that I can work with the <code>String</code> type in .NET directly... My question is then how does C++/CLI performance compares to native C code for heavy mathematical calculations and array access?</p>

<p>Thank you very much.</p>
","33708","","<p>C++/CLI will have to do some kind of marshaling too. </p>

Don't underestimate the optimizations that JIT compiler is going to do. Don't speculate on the overhead of a language implementation solely for being managed without trying. If it's not enough, have you considered unsafe C# code (with pointers) before trying unmanaged code? </p>

If you compile to managed code (CIL) with (<code>/clr:pure</code>), it's not going to be very different from C#.

","33708","","<p><code>delete</code>/<code>free</code> don't necessarily zero out memory. They can mark it as deallocated for the memory allocator.

<p><strong>UPDATE (Answer to the comment):</strong> As I mentioned above, verifiability is not equivalent to correctness (here I'm talking about ""correctness"" from a type-safety point of view). <em>Verifiable</em> programs are a strict subset of <em>correct</em> programs (i.e. all verifiable programs are demonstrably correct, but there are correct programs that are not verifiable). Thus, verifiability is a stronger property than correctness.  Since C# is a Turing-complete language, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice%27s_theorem"">Rice's theorem</a> states that proving that programs are correct is undecidable in general case.  </p>

<p>Let's get back to my <em>reachability</em> analogy as it's easier to explain.  Assume you were designing C#. One thing have thought about is when to issue a warning about unreachable code, and to remove that piece of code altogether in the optimizer, but how you are going to detect all unreachable code? Again, Rice's theorem says you can't do that for all programs. For instance:</p>

<pre><code>void Method() {
    while (true) {
    }
    DoSomething();  // unreachable code
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is something that C# compiler actually warns about.  But it doesn't warn about:</p>

<pre><code>bool Condition() {
   return true;
}

void Method() {
   while (Condition()) {
   }
   DoSomething();  // no longer considered unreachable by the C# compiler
}
</code></pre>

<p>A human can prove that control flow never reaches that line in the latter case.  One could argue that the compiler could statically prove <code>DoSomething</code> is unreachable in this case too, but it doesn't. Why?  The point is you can't do that for all programs, so you should draw the line at <em>some point</em>.  At this stage, you have to define a <strong>decidable</strong> property and call it ""reachability"".  For instance, for reachability, C# sticks to constant expressions and won't look at the contents of the functions at all.  Simplicity of analysis and design consistency are important goals in deciding where to draw the line. </p>

<p>Going back to our verifiability concept, it's a similar problem.  Verifiability, unlike correctness, is a decidable property.  As the runtime designer, you have to decide how to define verifiability, based on performance considerations, easy of implementation, ease of specification, consistency, making it easy for the compiler to confidently generate verifiable code.  Like most design decisions, it involves a lot of trade-offs.  Ultimately, the CLI designers have decided that they prefer not too look at generic constraints at all when they are checking for verifiability.</p>

<p>which is not what you expect. <code>ArrayList&lt;String&gt;</code> is a <code>List&lt;String&gt;</code>, but that's not enough for this code to be safe and correct. To be safe, it also requires <code>List&lt;String&gt;</code> to be <code>ArrayList&lt;String&gt;</code>, which means the generic type argument is not covariant here.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> 
For undesirable sitations like while(true), or for(;;), I already have a solution.

This doesn't work well with recursion since the stack limit is reached extremely quickly.</p>

Perhaps I've misrepresented the solution that I'm after. If I end up getting a lot of intentionally malicious code, I'll change the application to run the third party code in a separate process.

<p><strong>Accepted Answer</strong>
I've decided that the best approach would be to run the third party libraries in a separate process. I can have multiple instances of the processes running, and even do a sort of load balancing of my third party libraries across the processes. If malicious code is executed that kills one of the processes, I should be able to detect which library killed it, mark that library as malicious, and relaunch the process with all of the non-malicious libraries. </p>

"<p>Read in text books that stack grows by decreasing memory address, that is from higher address to lower address. May be a bad question, but i didnt get the concept right.</p>
","33708","","<p>First, it's platform dependent.  In some architectures, stack is allocated from the bottom of the address space and grows upwards.</p>

<p>Assuming an architecture like x86 that stack grown downwards from the top of address space, the idea is pretty simple:</p>

<pre><code>===============     Highest Address (e.g. 0xFFFF)
|             |
|    STACK    |
|             |
|-------------|  &lt;- Stack Pointer   (e.g. 0xEEEE)
|             |
.     ...     .
|             |
|-------------|  &lt;- Heap Pointer    (e.g. 0x2222)
|             |
|    HEAP     |
|             |
===============     Lowest Address  (e.g. 0x0000)
</code></pre>

<p>To grow stack, you'd decrease the stack pointer:</p>

<pre><code>===============     Highest Address (e.g. 0xFFFF)
|             |
|    STACK    |
|             |
|.............|  &lt;- Old Stack Pointer (e.g. 0xEEEE)
|             |
| Newly       |
| allocated   |
|-------------|  &lt;- New Stack Pointer (e.g. 0xAAAA)
.     ...     .
|             |
|-------------|  &lt;- Heap Pointer      (e.g. 0x2222)
|             |
|    HEAP     |
|             |
===============     Lowest Address    (e.g. 0x0000)
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, to grow stack, we have <em>decreased</em> the stack pointer from 0xEEEE to 0xAAAA, whereas to grow heap, you have to increase the heap pointer. </p>

<p><em>Obviously, this is a simplification of memory layout. The actual executable, data section, ... is also loaded in memory. Besides, threads have their own stack space.</em></p>

<p>You may ask, why should stack grow downwards. Well, as I said before, some architectures do the reverse, making heap grow downwards and stack grow upwards.  It makes sense to put stack and heap on opposite sides as it prevents overlap and allows both areas to grow freely as long as you have enough address space available.</p>

<p>Another valid question could be: Isn't the program supposed to decrease/increase the stack pointer itself? How can an architecture impose one over the other to the programmer? Why it's not so program dependent as it's architecture dependent? 
While you can pretty much fight the architecture and somehow get away your stack in the opposite direction, some instructions, notably <code>call</code> and <code>ret</code> that modify the stack pointer directly are going to assume another direction, making a mess.</p>

"<p>In c++, for vector,
    why preallocation is so important even if vector alocates space dynamically</p>
","33708","","<p>First, it's unlikely to be ""so important"" for 99% of cases.</p>

<p>It's basically an optimization.  Since vector doesn't have any idea how many elements you are going to add to it, it assumes a small default, and will have to grow if you try to add a new element and there is not enough space for a new element to be added.
The grow operation can be costly as it may require allocating an entirely new buffer, copying the current contents of the vector to the new buffer, and deallocating the old buffer. By preallocating enough space, if you know how many elements you are going to add, you can avoid unnecessary growth. </p>

<p>Like any performance optimization, you shouldn't worry about it unless it's a bottleneck. Moreover, if you have no idea how many elements you're going to add, let the vector decide. Don't assume your randomly chosen number is going to work better than the implementation default.</p>

"<p>In C, from what I understand, primitives like ints and floats are initialized to 0 when they are first declared. The same is true if a struct is declared that contains primitives. I'm having trouble finding a simple way to check if primitives are uninitialized or not.</p>

<p>For example, let's say I have an instance variable that is of type int declared in a header file. I need to use this variable in my implementation code, and it is important for me to know if this value has been initialized or not. Checking against zero isn't really an option, because if that value really is supposed to be zero then I've reinitialized a value that has already been changed. Checking against NULL also won't work, because it isn't a pointer.</p>

<p>The only solution that I've come up with is initializing the variable in the first piece of executable code to some value that I know will never be relevant to the rest of the program. For example, if the value should never be below zero, then I initialize it to -1 to know that it hasn't been initialized yet. This seems really crufty though, and can cause problems if the range of values to which the variable can be assigned changes.</p>

<p>Does anyone know why the use of <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.typedreference%28v=VS.80%29.aspx"">TypedReference</a> is so discouraged (implicitly, by lack of documentation)?</p>

<p>I've found great uses for it, such as when passing generic parameters through functions that shouldn't be generic (when using an <code>object</code> might be overkill or slow, if you need a value type), for when you need an opaque pointer, or for when you need to access an element of an array quickly, whose specs you find at runtime (using <code>Array.InternalGetReference</code>). Since the CLR doesn't even allow incorrect usage of this type, why is it discouraged? It doesn't seem to be unsafe or anything...</p>

<hr>

<p>Other uses I've found for <code>TypedReference</code>:</p>

<p>""Specializing"" generics in C# (this is type-safe):</p>

<pre><code>static void foo&lt;T&gt;(ref T value)
{
    //This is the ONLY way to treat value as int, without boxing/unboxing objects
    if (value is int)
    { __refvalue(__makeref(value), int) = 1; }
    else { value = default(T); }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Writing code that works with generic pointers (this is <em>very</em> unsafe if misused, but fast and safe if used correctly):</p>

<pre><code>//This bypasses the restriction that you can't have a pointer to T,
//letting you write very high-performance generic code.
//It's dangerous if you don't know what you're doing, but very worth if you do.
static T Read&lt;T&gt;(IntPtr address)
{
    var obj = default(T);
    var tr = __makeref(obj);

    //This is equivalent to shooting yourself in the foot
    //but it's the only high-perf solution in some cases
    //it sets the first field of the TypedReference (which is a pointer)
    //to the address you give it, then it dereferences the value.
    //Better be 10000% sure that your type T is unmanaged/blittable...
    unsafe { *(IntPtr*)(&amp;tr) = address; }

    return __refvalue(tr, T);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Writing a <em>method</em> version of the <code>sizeof</code> instruction, which can be occasionally useful:</p>

<pre><code>static class ArrayOfTwoElements&lt;T&gt; { static readonly Value = new T[2]; }

static uint SizeOf&lt;T&gt;()
{
    unsafe 
    {
        TypedReference
            elem1 = __makeref(ArrayOfTwoElements&lt;T&gt;.Value[0] ),
            elem2 = __makeref(ArrayOfTwoElements&lt;T&gt;.Value[1] );
        unsafe
        { return (uint)((byte*)*(IntPtr*)(&amp;elem2) - (byte*)*(IntPtr*)(&amp;elem1)); }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Writing a method that passes a ""state"" parameter that wants to avoid boxing:</p>

<pre><code>static void call(Action&lt;int, TypedReference&gt; action, TypedReference state)
{
    //Note: I could've said ""object"" instead of ""TypedReference"",
    //but if I had, then the user would've had to box any value types
    try
    {
        action(0, state);
    }
    finally { /*Do any cleanup needed*/ }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So why are uses like this ""discouraged"" (by lack of documentation)? Any particular safety reasons? It seems perfectly safe and verifiable if it's not mixed with pointers (which aren't safe or verifiable anyway)...</p>

","33708","","<p>Short answer: <strong>portability</strong>.</p>

<p>While <code>__arglist</code>, <code>__makeref</code>, and <code>__refvalue</code> are <em>language extensions</em> and are undocumented in the C# Language Specification, the constructs used to implement them under the hood (<code>vararg</code> calling convention, <code>TypedReference</code> type, <code>arglist</code>, <code>refanytype</code>, <code>mkanyref</code>, and <code>refanyval</code> instructions) are perfectly documented in the <a href=""http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-335.htm"">CLI Specification (ECMA-335)</a> in the <strong>Vararg library</strong>. </p>

<p>Being defined in the Vararg Library makes it quite clear that they are primarily meant to support variable-length argument lists and not much else.  Variable-argument lists have little use in platforms that don't need to interface with external C code that uses varargs.  For this reason, the Varargs library is not part of any CLI profile. Legitimate CLI implementations may choose not to support Varargs library as it's not included in the CLI Kernel profile: </p>

<blockquote>
  <h2>4.1.6 Vararg</h2>
  
  <p>The <strong>vararg feature set</strong> supports variable-length argument lists and runtime-typed pointers.  </p>
  
  <p><strong>If omitted:</strong> Any attempt to reference a method with the <code>vararg</code> calling convention or the signature encodings associated with vararg methods (see Partition II) shall throw the <code>System.NotImplementedException</code> exception. Methods using the CIL instructions <code>arglist</code>, <code>refanytype</code>, <code>mkrefany</code>, and <code>refanyval</code> shall throw the <code>System.NotImplementedException</code> exception. The precise timing of the exception is not specified. The type <code>System.TypedReference</code> need not be defined.</p>

<h3>Update (reply to <code>GetValueDirect</code> comment):</h3>

<p><code>FieldInfo.GetValueDirect</code> are <code>FieldInfo.SetValueDirect</code> are <strong>not</strong> part of Base Class Library. Note that there's a difference between .NET Framework Class Library and Base Class Library.

Even in Release builds, you can have the compiler to generate the PDB files and ship them alongside your assembly.  You can use <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/8cw0bt21%28v=vs.80%29.aspx""><code>csc /debug:pdbonly</code></a> when you're compiling your application.

<p>You get full stack trace in Release builds.  However, compilers may inline methods and optimize tail calls, making the stack trace different.</p>

"<p>Ok, I've thumped on this idea all day now, and I have reached the part where I admit I just flat out don't know. It's possible that what I'm doing is just stupid and there is a better way, but this is where my thinking has brought me.</p>

<p>I am attempting to use a generic method to load forms in WinForms:</p>

<pre><code>protected void LoadForm&lt;T&gt;(ref T formToShow, bool autoLoaded) where T : FormWithWorker, new()
{
    // Do some stuff
}
</code></pre>

<p>The forms are loaded by a ToolStripMenuItem (either through the selection of the item or using the Open Windows menu item). They are lazy-loaded, so there are fields for the forms within the MDI parent, but they are null until they are needed. I have a common method used for ToolStripMenuItem_Click that handles all of the menu item clicks. The method has no real way of knowing which form is being called for except that the name of the ToolStripMenuItem matches a pattern chosen for the form class names they correspond to. So, using the name of the ToolStripMenuItem, I can divine the name of the type of form being requested and the name of the private field allocated to store the reference for that form.</p>

<p>Using that, I can either use a growing/contracting switch statement with hard-coded types and string matches to call method with the specific type set (undesirable), or I can use Reflection to get the field and create the instance of the type. The problem to me is, <code>System.Activator.CreateInstance</code> provides an ObjectHandler that can't be cast to the types that I need. Here is a snippet of what I have so far:</p>

<pre><code>string formName = ""_form"" + ((ToolStripMenuItem)sender).Name.Replace(""ToolStripMenuItem"", """");
string formType = formName.Substring(1);

FieldInfo fi = this.GetType().GetField(formName, BindingFlags.NonPublic | BindingFlags.Instance);

FormWithWorker formToLoad = (FormWithWorker)fi.GetValue(this);
if (formToLoad == null)
{
    formToLoad = (????)System.Activator.CreateInstance(""MyAssemblyName"", formType);
}

this.LoadForm(ref formToLoad, false);
fi.SetValue(this, formToLoad);
</code></pre>

<p>I know the string name of the type that goes in for (????) but at compile-time I do not know the type because it changes. I have tried a bunch of ways to get this cast/instantiation to work, but none have been successful. I would very much like to know if it's possible to perform such a cast knowing the type only as a string. I tried using <code>Type.GetType(string, string)</code> to perform the cast, but the compiler didn't like it. If someone has a different idea on how to load the forms dynamically because I'm just doing it stupidly, please let me know about it.</p>
","33708","","<p>This problem is usually resolved by casting to a common base class or interface of all potential types.</p>

<p>In C# 4, you can also assign it to a <code>dynamic</code> variable to hold the return value and call arbitrary methods on it. The methods will be late bound. However, I prefer to stick to the former solution whenever possible.</p>

"<p>I would like to bin a set of objects, in particular Point types with an x and y value so that I can count the number of points at each x, y pair that exists in the set of Points.

","33708","","<p>Your current design is confusing. While you have not provided any information about the nature of the collection itself, from the name, I can assume you are supposed to iterate over a bunch of products. Perhaps, you should simply have a class of type <code>Product</code> with a <code>string</code> property and an <code>int</code> property and simply return an <code>IEnumerable&lt;Product&gt;</code> instead.</p>

<p>This way, with LINQ extension methods, you can compose the <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code> object you actually mean with:</p>

<pre><code>collection.Select(product =&gt; product.IntegerProperty)
collection.Select(product =&gt; product.StringProperty)

    public IEnumerable&lt;Product&gt; GetEnumerator() {
       // ... return Product objects here.

"<p>Suppose we have an arbitrary graph represented by nodes and pointers like this:</p>

<pre><code>class Node
{
    public ValueType data;
    public ArrayList&lt;Node&gt; adj;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, I want to take a copy of it or write/read it on the disk (AKA serialize/deserialize). I also know that it can be done using a search algorithm + associative arrays. And, it turns out that this method is called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointer_swizzling"" rel=""nofollow"">swizzling</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Here goes my question:</strong></p>

<p>I have heard that in Java by declaring the class as Serializable, this feature is provided for you automatically. (which sounds like a magic to me!)</p>

<p>Is this statement correct? Does Java automatically run BFS to traverse the graph and swizzle the pointers? In other words, does serialize/deserialize clone the object for me? (a completely brand new object with the same structure but new nodes and updated pointers)</p>

<p>If yes, then what if in some cases I just want to copy the pointers? what if I want to serialize the object just to keep the original pointers?</p>

<p>I appreciate any comments on this. :-)</p>
","33708","","<p>I'll address your last question first.  The purpose of serialization is not cloning an object graph in memory.  It is to transform an object graph to a stream of bytes in order to do things like saving in a file or sending across the wire.  The deserialization process might be done on a different computer, at a different time, in a different process, or even by a non-Java program, so it is not a reasonable expectation to get references to the same objects as before.  It is the structure and contents of the object graph that are being saved and later restored, not in-memory addresses.  For precisely this reason, it does not make sense for all objects to be serializable.  For instance, serializing a <code>Thread</code> is not going to be useful, because it is not going to be meaningful outside the current instance of a program.</p>

<p>The magic behind automatic serialization is not very complex.  Ignoring custom serialization methods that you can write for your own classes to precisely control the serialization and deserialization behavior, yes, the system will effectively traverse the object graph in order to generate a stream of bytes.  This traversal is generally done as a DFS, not BFS.  Basically, you ask Java to serialize an object, passing a reference to it.  That reference will serve as the root of the object graph.  From there, Java will recursively serialize the fields of that object.  Of course, it does track circular references and writes out appropriate markings in the output stream so that the deserializer is able to hook up the pointers and recreate the structure as it was before. </p>

<p>This is not necessarily true. From <code>rand</code> man page on Ubuntu:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code> The function rand() is not reentrant or thread-safe, since it uses hid‐
   den state that is modified on each call.  This might just be  the  seed
   value to be used by the next call, or it might be something more elabo‐
   rate.  In order to get reproducible behavior in a threaded application,
   this  state must be made explicit; this can be done using the reentrant
   function rand_r().

","33708","","<p>The primary reason behind global variables being bad is reliance of shared state, which makes it easy for different parts of a program to cause unanticipated interference with other parts of the program by manipulating the shared state in ways that you did not intend to, making the program more error prone, hard to debug, and hard to maintain.</p>

<p>Constants, on the other hand, are pretty much okay, except for the fact that they pollute the global namespace (which might cause unintended consequences at compile time by changing the meaning of a symbol in the compilation unit). If you can declare them in a specific namespace/scope, then you're going to be fine.</p>

<p>When I do this:</p>

<p>Any advice on approach welcome, plus info on online resources for Try(things).</p>
","33708","","<p><code>Parse</code> will return the double value if it succeeds and throws an exception otherwise. TryParse will return a boolean value representing the success of the operation and if it does succeed, it fills in the parsed value in the <code>out</code> argument you pass to it. It will never throw an exception.</p>

<p>In general, you should use <code>TryParse</code> when you expect the input string to not be a valid number and you have the logic to handle it (and display an error message, for instance). </p>

"<p>I'm confused as to how generics, namely <code>T</code> works in C#. It doesn't seem to behave the same way as C++, unless I'm mistaken. I'm trying to create a simple interface for a data gateway:</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> Updated to match the answers. Visual Studio now complains the derived classes don't implement the interface methods.</p>

<pre><code>public interface IDataGateway&lt;T&gt;
{
    void InsertRow(T row);
    void UpdateRow(T row);
    IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; GetTable();
}

public class LibraryGateway : IDataGateway&lt;Media&gt;
{
    public void InsertRow(Media item) { }
    public void Updaterow(Media item) { }
    public IEnumerable&lt;Media&gt; GetTable() { }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I do not know what type will be passed, which is why I'm trying to use generics.</p>
","33708","","<p>You are declaring the type argument on each method individually. You should declare it on the interface type itself.</p>

<pre><code>public interface IDataGateway&lt;T&gt;
{
    void InsertRow(T row);
    void UpdateRow(T row);
    IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; GetTable(T table);
}

public class LibraryGateway : IDataGateway&lt;Media&gt;
{
    public void InsertRow(Media item) { }
    public void Updaterow(Media item) { }
    public IEnumerable&lt;Media&gt; GetTable() { }
}
</code></pre>

<p>To clarify, your current implementation could be rewritten as:</p>

<pre><code>public interface IDataGateway
{
    void InsertRow&lt;T&gt;(T row);
    void UpdateRow&lt;U&gt;(U row);
    IEnumerable&lt;V&gt; GetTable(V table);
}

<p>That is, there is no requirement for <code>T</code> to be the same as <code>U</code> and <code>V</code>. Each method is genericized by its own type parameter, but the containing interface type itself is not generic.</p>

<p>By declaring the type argument on the type itself, you restrict the type arguments of the methods to be identical when implemented by a subclass. In C++ terms, which you seem to be familiar with, your current implementation is analogous to three separate template functions whereas my implementation is more similar to a template class.</p>

"<p>I'm working on a network program and I don't want anyone to know what kind of information is being passed when they sniff the network. Would using TLS achieve this? My main reason is that I want to keep the protocol I'm using to myself for now. If not please tell me if there is anything that can achieve my goal.</p>
","33708","","<p>It depends on a lot of things, e.g. what your exact threat model is, and how much information leakage you can tolerate.</p>

<p>For TLS to provide adequate protection, these assumptions must be true:</p>

<ol>
<li>Obviously, you should use a correct implementation, otherwise, if for instance, you are using SecureTransport from iOS 7.0.4, all bets are off.</li>
<li>You should enforce a minimum version requirement and only support secure ciphersuites. If you allow downgrade to SSLv2, you are setting yourself up for problems.</li>
<li>You check for validity of the server public key. You'd be surprised how many client apps skip this.</li>
<li>You use client certificates to authenticate the client, as well as the server, otherwise, it is possible to write a phony client that talks to your TLS server and reverse engineer your protocol. (You can also authenticate the client early in the protocol lifecycle using other means, but that part of your protocol would not be safe).</li>
<li>You keep the private keys secure.</li>
<li>(If you are using X509 certificates and trust chains:) Certificate authorities that you trust do what they are supposed to do, i.e. not sign certificates in your name for others.</li>
<li>You will still leak some packet length and timing information that you hope would not be complete enough for the reverse engineer.</li>
<li>The attacker does not control your client or server or have access to the binaries on any side. If, like an iPhone app, you are giving away the client binary, you have already lost.</li>
<li>Your higher level protocol cannot be tricked into say, redirecting to another server blindly, or lose its mind and do some other crazy thing when the client secure channel is interrupted. This can be hard to notice at times and depends on many other factors.</li>
