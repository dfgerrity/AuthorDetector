"<p>I have a CakePHP application that in some moment will show a view with product media (pictures or videos) I want to know if, there is someway to include another view that threats the video or threats the pictures, depending on a flag. I want to use those ""small views"" to several other purposes, so It should be ""like"" a cake component, for reutilization.</p>

<p>What you guys suggest to use to be in Cake conventions (and not using a raw <code>include('')</code> command)</p>
","16417","Paolo Bergantino","<p>In the interest of having the information here in case someone stumbles upon this, it is important to note that the solution varies depending on the CakePHP version.</p>

<h2>For CakePHP 1.1</h2>

<p><code>$this->renderElement('display', array('flag' => 'value'));</code></p>

<p>in your view, and then in <code>/app/views/elements/</code> you can make a file called <code>display.thtml</code>, where <code>$flag</code> will have the value of whatever you pass to it.</p>

<h2>For CakePHP 1.2</h2>

<p><code>$this->element('display', array('flag' => 'value'));</code></p>

<p>in your view, and then in <code>/app/views/elements/</code> you can make a file called <code>display.ctp</code>, where <code>$flag</code> will have the value of whatever you pass to it.
<hr>
In both versions the element will have access to all the data the view has access to + any values you pass to it. Furthermore, as someone pointed out, <code>requestAction()</code> is also an option, but it can take a heavy toll in performance if done without using cache, since it has to go through all the steps a normal action would.</p>

"<p>Is there any way to create the query parameters for doing a GET request in javascript. 
Just like in python you have <a href=""http://docs.python.org/lib/module-urllib.html"">urllib.urlencode()</a> which takes in a dict (or list of two tuples) and creates a string like 'var1=value1&amp;var2=value2'</p>

<p>If you are using <a href=""http://www.jquery.com/"">jQuery</a> there is <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Ajax/serialize"">Ajax/serialize</a></p>

<p>I do not know of any independent functions to accomplish this, though, but a google search for it turned up some promising options if you aren't currently using a library. If you're not, though, you really should because they are heaven.</p>

"<p>What are some popular spam prevention methods besides CAPTCHA?</p>
","16417","Paolo Bergantino","<p>I have tried doing 'honeypots' where you put a field and then hide it with CSS (marking it as 'leave blank' for anyone with stylesheets disabled) but I have found that a lot of bots are able to get past it very quickly. There are also techniques like setting fields to a certain value and changing them with JS, calculating times between load time and submit time, checking the referer URL, and a million other things. They all have their pitfalls and pretty much all you can hope for is to filter as much as you can with them while not alienating who you're here for: the users.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, though, if you really, really, don't want bots to be sending things through your form you're going to want to put a CAPTCHA on it - best one I've seen that takes care of mostly everything is <a href=""http://recaptcha.net"">reCAPTCHA</a> - but thanks to India's CAPTCHA solving market and the ingenuity of spammers everywhere that's not even successful all of the time. I would beware using something that is 'ingenious' but kind of 'out there' as it would be more of a 'wtf' for users that are at least somewhat used to your usual CAPTCHAs.</p>

","16417","Paolo Bergantino","<p>The great thing about libraries like <a href=""http://www.jquery.com"" rel=""nofollow"">jQuery</a> and <a href=""http://www.prototypejs.org"" rel=""nofollow"">Prototype</a> is that they take care of a lot of the cross-browser kwirks that can make Javascript such a pain to write.

"<p>OK, so I'm trying to teach myself the CakePHP framework, and I'm trying to knock up a simple demo app for myself.</p>

<p>I have the controllers, views and models all set up and working, but I want to do something slightly more than the basic online help shows.</p>

<p>I have a guitars_controller.php file as follows...</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
class GuitarsController extends AppController {
    var $name = 'Guitars';
    function index() {
    	$this-&gt;set('Guitars', $this-&gt;Guitar-&gt;findAll());
    	$this-&gt;pageTitle = ""All Guitars"";
    }
    function view($id = null) {
    	$this-&gt;Guitar-&gt;id = $id;
    	$this-&gt;set('guitar', $this-&gt;Guitar-&gt;read());
        // Want to set the title here.
    }
}
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The 'Guitar' object contains an attribute called 'Name', and I'd like to be able to set that as the pageTitle for the individual page views.  </p>

<p>Can anyone point out how I'd do that, please?  </p>

<p><strong>NB</strong>: I know that there is general disagreement about where in the application to set this kind of data, but to me, it is data related.</p>
","16417","Paolo Bergantino","<p>You can set this in the controller:</p>

<pre><code>function view($id = null) {
    $guitar = $this-&gt;Guitar-&gt;read(null, $id);
    $this-&gt;set('guitar', $guitar);
    $this-&gt;pageTitle = $guitar['Guitar']['name'];
}
</code></pre>

<p>Or in the view:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;? $this-&gt;pageTitle = $guitar['Guitar']['name']; ?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The value set in the view will override any value that may have already been set in the controller.</p>

<p>For security, you must ensure that your layout / view that displays the pageTitle html-encodes this arbitrary data to avoid injection attacks and broken html</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php echo h( $title_for_layout ); ?&gt;

"<p>I'm in search of a JavaScript month selection tool. I'm already using jQuery on the website, so if it were a jQuery plugin, that would fit nicely. I'm open to other options, as well.</p>

<p>Basically, I'm after a simplified version of the <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Datepicker"">jQuery UI Date Picker</a>. I don't care about the day of the month, just the month and year. Using the Date Picker control feels like overkill and a kludge. I know I could just use a pair of select boxes, but that feels cluttered, and then I also need a confirmation button.</p>

<p>I'm envisioning a grid of either two rows of six columns, or three rows of four columns, for month selection, and current and future years across the top. (Maybe the ability to list a few years? I can't see anyone ever needing to go more than a year or two ahead, so if I could list the current and next two years, that would be swell)</p>

<p>It's really just a dumbed down version of the DatePicker. Does something like this exist?</p>
","16417","Paolo Bergantino","<p>I used <a href=""http://www.mattkruse.com/javascript/calendarpopup/"" rel=""nofollow"">this script</a> in a program a while back. While it is ancient, it works on all browsers well. If you look down to ""Month-select calendar"" I believe that is what you are looking for. The example that is there has the calendar opening in a new window (ew) but 1 setting (like the 2nd example) makes it show ala jQuery. Good luck.</p>

"<p>I have a form that has multiple fields, and for testing purposes is there a way I could print out the values entered in all the fields, without having to individually print each value.</p>

"<p>Here's the information <a href=""http://www.php.net/manual/en/language.basic-syntax.php"">according to the official documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are four different pairs of
  opening and closing tags which can be
  used in PHP. Two of those, <code>&lt;?php ?&gt;</code>
  and <code>&lt;script language=""php""&gt; &lt;/script&gt;</code>,
  are always available. The other two
  are short tags and ASP style tags, and
  can be turned on and off from the
  php.ini configuration file. As such,
  while some people find short tags and
  ASP style tags convenient, they are
  less portable, and <strong>generally not
  recommended</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In my experience most servers <em>do</em> have short tags enabled. Typing</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?=
</code></pre>

<p>is far more convenient than typing</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php echo 
</code></pre>

<p>The programmers convenience is an important factor, so <strong>why</strong> are they not recommended?</p>
","16417","Paolo Bergantino","<p>I'm too fond of <code>&lt;?=$whatever?&gt;</code> to let it go. Never had a problem with it. I'll wait until it bites me in the ass. In all seriousness, 85% of (my) clients have access to php.ini in the <strong>rare</strong> occasion they are turned off. The other 15% use mainstream hosting providers, and virtually all of them have them enabled. I love 'em.</p>

"<p>I'm using jQuery to hide and show elements when a radio button group is altered/clicked. It works fine in browsers like Firefox, but in IE 6 and 7, the action only occurs when the user then clicks somewhere else on the page.</p>

<p>To elaborate, when you load the page, everything looks fine. In Firefox, if you click a radio button, one table row is hidden and the other one is shown immediately. However, in IE 6 and 7, you click the radio button and nothing will happen until you click somewhere on the page. Only then does IE redraw the page, hiding and showing the relevant elements.</p>

<p>Here's the jQuery I'm using:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function () {
  $("".hiddenOnLoad"").hide();

  $(""#viewByOrg"").change(function () {
    $("".visibleOnLoad"").show();
    $("".hiddenOnLoad"").hide();
  });

  $(""#viewByProduct"").change(function () {
    $("".visibleOnLoad"").hide();
    $("".hiddenOnLoad"").show();
  });
});
</code></pre>

<p>Here's the part of the XHTML that it affects. Apologies if it's not very clean, but the whole page does validate as XHTML 1.0 Strict:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;View by:&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;input type=""radio"" name=""viewBy"" id=""viewByOrg"" value=""organisation""
      checked=""checked"" /&gt;Organisation&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;input type=""radio"" name=""viewBy"" id=""viewByProduct"" value=""product"" /&gt;Product&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=""visibleOnLoad""&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;Organisation:&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;
    &lt;select name=""organisation"" id=""organisation"" multiple=""multiple"" size=""10""&gt;

"<p>I have a bunch of records in several tables in a database that have a ""process number"" field, that's basically a number, but I have to store it as a string both because of some legacy data that has stuff like ""89a"" as a number and some numbering system that requires that process numbers be represented as number/year.</p>

<p>From then on it's pretty straight forward. For things like width/height you can verify them with <a href=""http://www.php.net/is_numeric"" rel=""nofollow""><code>is_numeric</code></a> and with the rest you can run the values through <a href=""http://www.php.net/htmlentities"" rel=""nofollow""><code>htmlentities</code></a> and construct your own <code>&lt;embed&gt;</code> tag from the information. I am pretty certain this would be safe. You can even make the full-fledged <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> one like YouTube (which I assume works in more places) with links from blip.tv, since you would have all the required data.</p>

<p>I am sure you may see some quirks with links from other video-sharing websites but this will hopefully get you started. Good luck.</p>

"<p>I am a big fan of the Lightbox2 library, and have used it in the past just not on an MVC project. In the past I remember that Lightbox2 was picky about the paths it scripts, css, and images resided in. I remember specifically have to put everything in subdirectories of the page's path, else it wouldn't work.</p>

<p>In a non-MVC application that approach was fine, but now I find myself working on an MVC application and a page's URL may have nothing to do with the directory structure. So linking to Lightbox2 per the instructions of:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""js/prototype.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""js/scriptaculous.js?load=effects,builder""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""js/lightbox.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>obviously does not work.</p>

<p>I tried putting the absolute path to the JavaScript which gave me the effects, just without the images. I am suspecting that the JavaScript ""knows"" where its images are, and cannot find them.</p>

<p>Has anyone had success with Lightbox2 in an MVC environment? Perhaps just success deploying Lightbox2 to a non-subdirectory?</p>

<p>From the PHP manual:</p>

<blockquote>For backwards compatibility, if PHP 5 cannot find a __construct() function for a given class, it will search for the old-style constructor function, by the name of the class. Effectively, it means that the only case that would have compatibility issues is if the class had a method named __construct() which was used for different semantics</blockquote>

"<p>I'm creating a web application for work where the user has to enter the name of the person that requested the job.  I'd like to create a simple AJAX auto-suggest dropdown so they don't need to type the entire name.  On the backend, the database will provide suggestions based on previous entries.

&lt;?php foreach($people as $person): ?&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;?php echo $person['Person']['name']; ?&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;?php endforeach; ?&gt;

","16417","Paolo Bergantino","<p>Check out <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/CSS/css"" rel=""nofollow"">the jQuery documentation</a>. If you want anything it will be there.</p>

<p>Anyhow, if you want to add styles to elements, you need to use the <code>css</code> function, which has a few variants.</p>

<pre><code>$(selector).css(properties);  // option 1
$(selector).css(name, value); // option 2
</code></pre>

<p>So if you have a DIV with ID of ""mydiv"" and you want to make the background red, you would do</p>

<pre><code>$(""div#mydiv"").css({'background-color' : 'red'}); // option 1
$(""div#mydiv"").css('background-color','red');     // option 2
</code></pre>

<p>The first way is easier if you're setting multiple things at once.</p>

<p>If you want to check what a property is currently set to, you would use a variant of the 2nd option, just omit the value.</p>

<pre><code>var color = $(""div#mydiv"").css('background-color');
</code></pre>

<p>Would make the var <code>color</code> be <code>red</code> if you already set it above, for example.</p>

"<p>In our current project we are providing a PDF download that can be customized by the user through an HTML form he submits. It takes several seconds to dynamically generate the PDF and I'd like to visualize this, e.g. by disabling the submit button until the download starts. Unfortunately, I couldn't find a way to detect when the download starts*. So I wouldn't know when to re-enable the submit button.</p>

<p>I already tried to specify an IFrame as the target of my HTML form, hoping that the <code>onload</code> event would be triggered. It is not, however -- probably because the PDF is sent with a ""<code>Content-disposition: attachment</code>"" header and it is not actually loaded into the IFrame.</p>

<p>The only solution I can think of right now involves generating the PDF to a temporary file on the server, which I would like to avoid.</p>

<p>*)Let me clarify this: I wouldn't need to know if the download was finished or even if it was really started. I'd like to detect the point at which the browser will ask the user whether to open or to save the file. I guess this happens when the browser receives the HTTP header.</p>
","16417","Paolo Bergantino","<p>If I was you I would do an AJAX call to the server with the information, generate the file, then return the file name/id/whatever back to the javascript, which then makes window.location something like download.php?id=x (but the file was already generated, so it is just setting the headers and reading it out) at which point you can re-enable the submit.</p>

"<p>I have a form on a page where the user has inputs to edit a XML file, the action for the form is to send it to a separate PHP script where the editing takes place after they hit submit. The script will either write successful or fail, either way I have it redirect back to the form page via a header. Is there an easy way to pass back a confirmation or failure message to the form page? I can do it in the URL but I rather keep that clean looking.</p>
","16417","Paolo Bergantino","<p>The way that I've seen it done (and I personally use) is simply sessions.</p>

<pre><code>// process something
if($success) {
    flash_message('success','Did whatever successfully.');
} else {
    flash_message('error','Oops, something went wrong.');
}
header('Location: whatever.php');
</code></pre>

<p>Then somewhere else, in your library or function file or whatever:</p>

<pre><code>function flash_message($type, $message) {
    // start session if not started
    $_SESSION['message'] = array('type' =&gt; $type, 'message' =&gt; $message);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then in the view/page you could do:</p>

<pre><code>if(isset($_SESSION['message'])) {
    printf(""&lt;div class='message %s'&gt;%s&lt;/div&gt;"", $_SESSION['message']['type'],
    $_SESSION['message']['message']);
    unset($_SESSION['message']);
}

<p>This is pretty basic but you could expand it from there if you want multiple messages and so on. Bottom line is that I believe sessions are best for this.</p>

Essentially, many/most carriers have an email address connected to a phone number that will easily let you send texts to the number. For example, if you have ATT and your phone number is 786-262-8344, an email to 7682628344@txt.att.net will send you a text message with the subject/body of the email, free of charge.

<p>I've got a feeling it's because the columns are sized based on children, but by sizing the element based on it's parent, I've created a 'catch 22'.</p>

<p>Can somebody please enlighten me as to what is going on, and how I might maintain the same column width, and size my element to 80% of it's width?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
","16417","Paolo Bergantino","<p>The problem that you are having is because you are setting the <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>'s width to be a percentage of a cell that has no width. So the cell is becoming smaller to make up for the text on the other cell and once that's done the input is getting 80% of whatever is left.</p>

<p>Your options:<br />
1) Set a width in pixels for the <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> field.<br />
2) Set a width in pixels/percentage for the <code>&lt;td&gt;</code>. </p>

<p><strong>addressing your comment:</strong> When you remove the style, the reason it is getting larger is because it is going back to the browser's default size for <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> elements, which is bigger than 80% of whatever's left in the cell.</p>

"<p>I've tried my best to be a purist with my usage of Javascript/Ajax techniques, ensuring that all Ajax-y behavior is an enhancement of base functionality, while the site is also fully functional when Javascript is disabled.  However, this causes some problems.</p>

<p>In some cases, a DOM node should only be visible when Javascript is enabled in the browser.  In other cases, it should only be visible when disabled.  Take for instance a submit button on a form that has a drop down with an onchange handler that auto-submits (using JQuery's form plugin):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form method=""post"" action="".""&gt;
    &lt;label for=""id_state""&gt;State:&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;select name=""state"" id=""id_state"" onchange=""$(this.form).ajaxSubmit(ajax_submit_handler);""&gt;
        &lt;option value=""AL""&gt;Alabama&lt;/option&gt;
        &lt;option value=""AK""&gt;Alaska&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;/select&gt;
    &lt;input class=""with_js_disabled"" type=""submit"" value=""OK"" /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and the Javascript:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
    $(document).ready(function()
    {
        $("".with_js_disabled"").hide();
    });
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>When Javascript is enabled, the submit button is not required (due to the onchange handler).  However, JQuery's $(document).ready function (and the more direct document.onload) is only called after the page has been fully loaded and rendered - hence, the submit button is initially displayed and a ""flash"" occurs when the Javascript is executed and the node's display is set to ""none"".</p>

<p>I've accepted this as the cost of doing business, and haven't found a way around it.  But is there a technique I'm not aware of that will minimize the effect, or even outright eliminate it?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>The <code>&lt;noscript&gt;</code> solution mentioned by many people below seems promising, but isn't working for me on Safari.  However Prestaul's 2nd suggestion works beautifully:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
        document.body.className += ' has_js';
    &lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;!-- the rest of your page --&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This can then be styled using straight CSS:</p>

<pre><code>body .js_enabled_only { display: none; }
body .js_disabled_only { display: block; }
body.has_js .js_enabled_only { display: block; }
body.has_js .js_disabled_only { display: none; }
</code></pre>

<p>This second line is just for reference and can (and should) be removed to avoid circumstances where your element shouldn't be display:block.  Likewise, you may need different variations on the third line for other display styles.  But this solution is nice and clean, IMO, and in my tests entirely eliminates the flicker effect.</p>
","16417","Paolo Bergantino","<p>For situations identical to yours, I usually put the submit button around a <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/interact/scripts.html#h-18.3.1"" rel=""nofollow""><code>&lt;noscript&gt;</code></a> tag. No one has suggested it, so I am not sure if it is considered bad practice around these parts, but it is what I use and it works for me.</p>

<p>If you only want a node visible when Javascript is enabled, you could do in the head:</p>

    .js-enabled { display: none; }

"<p>I have the following JQuery code which does similar functionality like Stackoverflow where the user clicks on the comment link and it displays the comments or in this case replies to a member's status update, generally it works great except when a member posts a new status update which updates the list of status updates using an ajax async postback in ASP.net MVC.</p>

<p>What happens is if you click on the new item in the list it brings them to a new page instead of doing what the JQuery is suppose to do.</p>

"<p>Is there a built in method or defacto default plugin that will let you automatically assign an unique ID to an element in jQuery, or do you need to implement something like this yourself?

<pre><code>$('#foo span').identify('prefix');   //fake code, no such method

"<p>Is it possible to use Javascript inside CSS?</p>

"<p>Howdy all.  I'd like to know if it's possible to determine what <strong>inline styling</strong> has been attributed to an HTML element.  I do not need to retrieve the value, but rather just detect if it's been set inline or not.</p>

<p>For instance, if the HTML were:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""foo"" style=""width: 100px; height: 100px; background: green;""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>How can I determine that ""width,"" ""height,"" and ""background"" have been explicitly declared, inline?</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, the solution can work two ways.  I can ask it if a specific attribute is set and it will tell me true or false, or it can tell me all attributes that have been set.  Like so:</p>

<pre><code>var obj = document.getElementById('foo');
obj.hasInlineStyle('width');  //returns true;
obj.hasInlineStyle('border'); //returns false;

//or

obj.getInlineStyles();   //returns array with values:
                       // 'width' 'height' and 'background'
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not interested in css attributes that are inherited via declarations in a stylesheet, only inline styles.  One last thing, I have no control over the HTML source.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
","16417","Paolo Bergantino","<p><strong>Updated to work with IE</strong></p>

<p>You could try something like this</p>

<pre><code>function hasInlineStyle(obj, style) {
    var attrs = obj.getAttribute('style');
    if(attrs === null) return false;
    if(typeof attrs == 'object') attrs = attrs.cssText;
    var styles = attrs.split(';');
    for(var x = 0; x &lt; styles.length; x++) {
        var attr = styles[x].split(':')[0].replace(/^\s+|\s+$/g,"""").toLowerCase();
        if(attr == style) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;

<pre><code>&lt;span id='foo' style='color: #000; line-height:20px;'&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

<p>That also has a stylesheet like this:</p>

<pre><code>#foo { background-color: #fff; }

  <p>This implementation is slightly over-pessimistic; if the browser window loses focus, the activeElement is set to null (as the input control loses focus as well). If your application needs the activeElement value even when the browser window doesn't have the focus, you could remove the blur event listener.</p>

"<p>I'm trying to resize an embedded object.  The issue is that when the mouse hovers over the object, it takes ""control"" of the mouse, swallowing up movement events.  The result being that you can expand the div containing the object, but when you try to shrink it, if the mouse enters the area of the object the resize halts.  </p>

<p>Currently, I hide the object while moving.  I'm wondering if there's a way to just prevent the object from capturing the mouse.  Perhaps overlaying another element on top of it that prevents mouse events from reaching the embedded object?</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>using ghosting on the resize doesn't work for embedded objects, btw.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>Adding a bounty, as I can't ever seem to get this working.  To collect, simply do the following:</p>

<p>Provide a webpage with a PDF embedded in it, centered on the page.  The pdf can't take up the entire page; make its width/height 50% the width of the browser window or something.</p>

<p>Use jQuery 1.2.6 to add resize to every side and corner of the pdf.  </p>

<p>The pdf MUST NOT CAPTURE THE MOUSE and stop dragging WHEN SHRINKING THE PDF.  That means when I click on the edge of the pdf and drag, when the mouse enters the display box of the pdf, the resize operation continues.</p>

<p>This must work in IE 7.  Conditional CSS (if gte ie7 or whatever) hacks are fine.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>Hmmm... I'm thinking it might be an issue with iframe...</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;div style=""text-align:center; padding-top:50px;""&gt;
    &lt;div id=""doc"" style=""width:384px;height:512px;""&gt;
    &lt;iframe id=""docFrame"" style=""width: 100%; height: 100%;""
 src='http://www.ready.gov/america/_downloads/sampleplan.pdf'&gt;
    &lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div id=""data""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
        $(document).ready(function() {
        var obj = $('#docFrame');
            $('#doc').resizable({handles:'all', resize: function(e, ui) {
                $('#data').html(ui.size.width + 'x' + ui.size.height);
                obj.attr({width: ui.size.width, height: ui.size.height});
            }});
        });
    &lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This doesn't work.  When your mouse strays into the iframe the resize operation stops.</p>

"<p>I am looking to allow users to select a pre-uploaded image to a user generated web page.</p>

<p>I have a list of the available images, so I could easily do this with a select control, however, I'd really like to allow the users to select from a pop up of thumbnails, rather than text, then have that populate a text form element with the resulting file name.  I'm hoping the end result will be like a calendar pop-up date selector.</p>

<p>I'm sure there is a simple way to do this using Jquery / other javascript.  Does anyone know of a pre built widget / example of this, or can people point me in the right direction of where to start?  I'm pretty new to Javascript, but willing to invest some time in learning...</p>

<p>Clarification: A grid or list of thumbnails is what I'm after ideally, but the main thing is to give the user a visual representation of the picture, rather than it's filename...</p>

<h2>What happened?</h2>

<p>The change to the PHP code is making use of PHP's <a href=""http://us3.php.net/json_encode"" rel=""nofollow""><code>json_encode</code></a> function to print out the id of the business to which the note was added as well as the actual note text. In the javascript code, I added the <code>dataType</code> of 'json' to tell the script what format of response to expect. Once the request is received in the <code>success</code> callback, the <code>data</code> variable is an object with the values we passed through <code>json_encode</code>. So <code>data.id</code> has the business id and <code>data.note</code> has the new note. Using jQuery's <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Attributes/html"" rel=""nofollow""><code>html()</code></a> manipulation function, the inner html of the div is updated to the latest note. The div selector uses the id we passed, so we can update the corresponding div.</p>

<p>Also, this is slightly off topic, but make sure you always use <a href=""http://us2.php.net/mysql_real_escape_string"" rel=""nofollow""><code>mysql_real_escape_string</code></a> when putting values into a query like you are. If you do not use this, your queries will be vulnerable and susceptible to injection attacks, and they are not pretty. If a customer decided to enter a note value of <code>');DROP TABLE businesses;</code> you'd really feel the pain. Preferably, switch to <a href=""http://us.php.net/pdo"" rel=""nofollow""><code>PDO</code></a> or <a href=""http://us.php.net/mysqli"" rel=""nofollow""><code>MySQLi</code></a> and use <a href=""http://us.php.net/manual/en/pdo.prepared-statements.php"" rel=""nofollow""><code>prepared statements</code></a>, as they are the 'correct' way of doing queries nowadays.</p>

","16417","Paolo Bergantino","<p>It has to be clicked twice because you are defining <code>#microsubmit</code>'s <code>click</code> event inside the function. So the first time you click you bind the event handler, and the 2nd time the event handler is in place and gets fired. I haven't gone over the logic behind what you're trying to accomplish but my guess is that if you move the event binder outside the function and make sure all your variables are in the right scopes then it'll work.</p>

<p>You are overwriting the <code>projects</code> passed into the function with the <code>projects</code> in the 2nd line. I used a <code>$</code> in my code to differentiate the two, which was admittedly perhaps not the best of ways. To fix, change the code to this:</p>

<p>So, how can I get ajax form to recognize the new form, so that if i need to use the form a second time, it is also utilizing the jQuery function?</p>

</code></pre>
","16417","Paolo Bergantino","<p>The easiest solution to this is not using jQuery's form plugin and doing it manually, which is really not very difficult:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function() {

        var formdata = $(this).serialize();

            }
        });
        return false;
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>Now since you are using jQuery's new (1.3) <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Events/live"" rel=""nofollow""><code>live</code></a> functionality, any forms you add that match the <code>form[id*=postOnline]</code> selector will still be wired with this event.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can open up the jquery forms code and find wherever it does its binding and try to modify it so that it uses it <code>live</code>. Even another alternative would be to encompass the wiring in a function, and call it at the end of your success function, like so:</p>

<pre><code>function bindForm() {
    jQuery('form[id*=postOnline]').ajaxForm({ 
        dataType: 'json',
        success: function(data) {

<p>According to FireBug, the major bottleneck in my page loading times seems to be a gap between the loading of the html and the loading of Google adsense and analytics.  Notice in the screenshot below that the initial GET only takes 214 ms, and that adsense + analytics loading takes roughly 130 ms combined.  However, the entire page load time is 1.12 seconds due to that large pause in between the initial GET and the adsense/analytics loading.</p>

<p>If it makes any difference at all, the site is running off of the ASP.NET MVC RC1 stack.</p>

<p><img src=""http://kevinwilliampang.com/pics/firebug.jpg"" alt=""alt text"" /></p>

<p><strong>Update: After removing adsense and analytics, I'm still seeing a slow response time.  Hovering over the initial GET request, I see that the following speeds: 96ms Receiving Data, 736ms DOMContentLoaded (event), 778ms 'load' (event).  I'm guessing then that the performance is a result of my own jQuery javascript that has processing tied to the ($document).ready() event?</strong></p>

","16417","Paolo Bergantino","<p>This is not possible because you're mixing client-side behavior with server-side behavior. What you need to do is create an AJAX request to the server.</p>

<p>If you were using a library like <a href=""http://www.jquery.com"">jQuery</a> (which you really want to, because it makes AJAX a breeze) you would do something like this:</p>

<h2>PHP Code (maybe randomImages.php?)</h2>

// since we passed it from the Javascript
// put them all in an array like this:

print json_encode($images); // return them to the client in JSON format.

","16417","Paolo Bergantino","<p>No benchmarks, but I personally feel like <code>$array[]</code> is cleaner to look at, and honestly splitting hairs over milliseconds is pretty irrelevant unless you plan on appending hundreds of thousands of strings to your array.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Ran this code:</p>

<pre><code>$t = microtime(true);
$array = array();
for($i = 0; $i &lt; 10000; $i++) {
    $array[] = $i;
}
print microtime(true) - $t;
print '&lt;br&gt;';
$t = microtime(true);
$array = array();
for($i = 0; $i &lt; 10000; $i++) {
    array_push($array, $i);
}
print microtime(true) - $t;
</code></pre>

<p>The first method using <code>$array[]</code> is almost 50% faster than the second one.</p>

<h3>Some benchmark results:</h3>

<pre><code>Run 1
0.0054171085357666 // array_push
0.0028800964355469 // array[]

Run 2

<p>This shouldn't be surprising, as the PHP manual notes this:</p>

<p>The way it is phrased I wouldn't be surprised if <code>array_push</code> is more efficient when adding multiple values. <strong>EDIT</strong>: Out of curiosity, did some further testing, and even for a large amount of additions, individual <code>$array[]</code> calls are faster than one big <code>array_push</code>.

}

<p>The above function triggers when you hit submit in a registration form (as must be obvious). The problem is, this form submits irrespective of what the response is, and the alert box sometimes shows nothing [blank], sometimes doesn't show at all. However, if I change the ending <code>status</code> to <code>false</code> manually [i.e. replace <code>status</code> with <code>false</code>], the correct value shows up in the alert box.</p>

<p>P.S. I'm worse than a noob in javascript, so suggestions on generally improving the code is also welcome.</p>
","16417","Paolo Bergantino","<p>The problem is that <code>onreadystatechange</code> won't fire until... wait for it... the state changes. So when you <code>return status;</code> most of the time status will not have had time to set. What you need to do is <code>return false;</code> always and inside the <code>onreadystatechange</code> determine whether you want to proceed or not. If you do, then you submit the form. In short, take the code that handles the return value and instead run it from within the readystatechange handler. You can do this directly:</p>

<pre><code>request.onreadystatechange = function() {
    if (request.readyState == 4) {
        var resp = parseInt(request.responseText, 10);
        switch (resp) {
        case 0:
            document.getElementById('myform').submit();
            break;
        case 1:
            alert(""The display name has already been taken."");
            break;
        case 2:
            alert(""This student ID has already been registered"");
            break;
        }
    }
}
return false; // always return false initially
</code></pre>

<p>or by passing a <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/b/wesdyer/archive/2007/12/22/continuation-passing-style.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">continuation</a> to the function that makes the asynchronous call:</p>

<pre><code>function checkUser(success, fail) {
    ...
    request.onreadystatechange = function() {
        if (request.readyState == 4) {
            var resp = parseInt(request.responseText, 10);
            switch (resp) {
            case 0:
                success(request.responseText);
            case 1:
                fail(""The display name has already been taken."", request.reponseText);
                break;
            case 2:
                fail(""This student ID has already been registered"", request.reponseText);

            default:
                fail(""Unrecognized resonse: ""+resp, request.reponseText);
                break;
            }
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>In addition to this, before the default <code>return false;</code> you might want to have some sort of indicator that something is going on, perhaps disable the submit field, show a loading circle, etc. Otherwise users might get confused if it is taking a long time to fetch the data.</p>

<h3>Further explanation</h3>

<p>Alright, so the reason your way didn't work is mostly in this line:</p>

<pre><code>request.onreadystatechange = function() {
</code></pre>

<p>What that is doing is saying that when the <code>onreadystatechange</code> of the AJAX request changes, the anonymous function you are defining will run. This code is NOT being executed right away. It is waiting for an event to happen. This is an asynchronous process, so at the end of the function definition javascript will keep going, and if the state has not changed by the time it gets to <code>return status;</code> the variable <code>status</code> will obviously not have had time to set and your script would not work as expected. The solution in this case is to always <code>return false;</code> and then when the event fires (ie, the server responded with the PHP's script output) you can then determine the status and submit the form if everything is a-ok.</p>

(ie the id value of its corresponding div)</p>

<p>I want my output to look like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""page"" id=""page_1""&gt;
...content...
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=""page"" id=""page_2""&gt;
...content...
&lt;/div&gt;

.....

&lt;div class=""page"" id=""page_n""&gt;
...content...
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;ul #menu&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""#page_1""&gt;Page 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""#page_2""&gt;Page 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
.....
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""#page_n""&gt;Page n&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I'm adding the id's okay with:</p>

<pre><code>$('li.page').each(function(index){$(this).attr(""id"", ""page_"" + (index+1));
    });
</code></pre>

<p>But I'm struggling with the second part of my problem. I know this is probably kinda basic, but I'm just starting out....</p>

<p>Any help gratefully received... thanks in advance...</p>

","16417","Paolo Bergantino","<p>It is to avoid typos. If you have to type the password twice chances are you'll make your password what you want. They want to avoid having people whose password is ""blah"" having to retrieve their password later on because they typed ""blaj"" by mistake. This is especially true since password fields show as asterisks (<code>*********</code>) and sometimes it is hard to tell if you typed what you thought you typed - people are likely to make typos without even realizing it. Some websites do this too with the email address when it is essential that is correct as well.</p>

"<p>To teach myself Javascript, I'm trying to make a web page that gives users a list of items (e.g. foods), asks them to sort these foods from favorite to least favorite, and submit the data when they're done. Using jQuery sortables seems like a good way to do this. However, I'm not sure how the data submission should happen.</p>

<p>Here's what I'm thinking. Each of these food items would be in a div like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""sortable""&gt;
    &lt;div id=""1"" class=""foods""&gt;Pizza&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div id=""2"" class=""foods""&gt;Sushi&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div id=""3"" class=""foods""&gt;Taco&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>When the user clicks a ""submit"" button, I want the order of these items to be determined, and for this ordering to be sent back to the server (by the way, I'm using Django on the server side). It seems I can determine the order of the items with a function like this:</p>

<pre><code>function getOrder()
{
    var foods = $("".foods"");
    var ids = [];

    for(var x=0; x&lt;foods.length; x++)
    {
        ids.push(foods[x].id);
    }
    return ids;
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, I'm stuck on a couple of things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Where in my code would I call this function? I'm thinking it would be an onclick action when the user presses the submit button, but I'm not sure where the data the function returns would get passed.</li>
<li>What format would be the most appropriate for sending this ordering to the server (e.g JSON)?</li>
</ul>

<p>(I know this is a really basic question, but I have never made a web page with JavaScript before, so this area of programming is all new to me.)</p>
","16417","Paolo Bergantino","<p>A more semantically relevant way of doing a list is by using an actual <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> element.</p>

<p>So if you had something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ul id='foods'&gt;
&lt;li id='food_1'&gt;Pizza&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id='food_2'&gt;Sushi&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id='food_3'&gt;Taco&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;a href=""javascript:saveFoods();""&gt;Save Order&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The following jQuery code would be appropiate:</p>

<pre><code>function saveFoods(id) {
    var data = $(""#foods"").sortable('serialize');
    var action = ""/django/view/"";
    $.post(action, data, function(json, status) {
        if(status == 'success' &amp;&amp; json.status == 'success') {
            alert('Saved order of the foods!');
        } else {
            alert('Unable to complete the request.');
        }
    }, ""json"");
}
</code></pre>

<p>According to the jQuery docs on <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Sortable"" rel=""nofollow"">sortable</a>, when you use serialize the elements of a sortable it requires their IDs to be in a <code>setname_number</code> format. So by having your list as <code>food_1</code>, <code>food_2</code>, etc. jQuery recognizes that the ID of Pizza is 1 and its set is food. The <code>data</code> variable in <code>saveFoods</code> will then contain something like <code>food[]=1&amp;food[]=2&amp;food[]=3</code> that you can process in your Django app.</p>

"<p>I want to automatically add new forms to a Django formset using Ajax, so that when the user clicks an ""add"" button it runs JavaScript that adds a new form (which is part of the formset) to the page.</p>
","16417","Paolo Bergantino","<p>This is how I do it, using <a href=""http://www.jquery.com"">jQuery</a>:</p>

<p>My template:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;h3&gt;My Services&lt;/h3&gt;
{{ serviceFormset.management_form }}
{% for form in serviceFormset.forms %}
    &lt;div class='table'&gt;
    &lt;table class='no_error'&gt;
        {{ form.as_table }}
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
{% endfor %}
&lt;input type=""button"" value=""Add More"" id=""add_more""&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
    $('#add_more').click(function() {
        cloneMore('div.table:last', 'service');
    });
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In a javascript file:</p>

<pre><code>function cloneMore(selector, type) {
    var newElement = $(selector).clone(true);
    var total = $('#id_' + type + '-TOTAL_FORMS').val();
    newElement.find(':input').each(function() {
        var name = $(this).attr('name').replace('-' + (total-1) + '-','-' + total + '-');
        var id = 'id_' + name;
        $(this).attr({'name': name, 'id': id}).val('').removeAttr('checked');
    });
    newElement.find('label').each(function() {
        var newFor = $(this).attr('for').replace('-' + (total-1) + '-','-' + total + '-');
        $(this).attr('for', newFor);
    });
    total++;
    $('#id_' + type + '-TOTAL_FORMS').val(total);
    $(selector).after(newElement);
}
</code></pre>

<p>What it does:</p>

<p><code>cloneMore</code> accepts <code>selector</code> as the first argument, and the <code>type</code> of formset as the 2nd one. What the <code>selector</code> should do is pass it what it should duplicate. In this case, I pass it <code>div.table:last</code> so that jQuery looks for the last table with a class of <code>table</code>. The <code>:last</code> part of it is important because the <code>selector</code> is also used to determine what the new form will be inserted after. More than likely you'd want it at the end of the rest of the forms. The <code>type</code> argument is so that we can update the <code>management_form</code> field, notably <code>TOTAL_FORMS</code>, as well as the actual form fields. If you have a formset full of, say, <code>Client</code> models, the management fields will have IDs of <code>id_clients-TOTAL_FORMS</code> and <code>id_clients-INITIAL_FORMS</code>, while the form fields will be in a format of <code>id_clients-N-fieldname</code> with <code>N</code> being the form number, starting with <code>0</code>. So with the <code>type</code> argument the <code>cloneMore</code> function looks at how many forms there currently are, and goes through every input and label inside the new form replacing all the field names/ids from something like <code>id_clients-(N)-name</code> to <code>id_clients-(N+1)-name</code> and so on. After it is finished, it updates the <code>TOTAL_FORMS</code> field to reflect the new form and adds it to the end of the set.</p>

<p>This function is particularly helpful to me because the way it is setup it allows me to use it throughout the app when I want to provide more forms in a formset, and doesn't make me need to have a hidden ""template"" form to duplicate as long as I pass it the formset name and the format in which the forms are laid out. Hope it helps.</p>

"<p>Thanks for the three excellent answers which all identified my problem of using ""onclick = ..."" instead of ""observe( ""click"",...""</p>

<p>But the award for Accepted Answer has to go to Paolo Bergantino for the mechanism of adding a class name to mark the dragged element, which saved me some more work!</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>In my HTML I have a table with an image link on each row.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;table class=""search_results""&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
     &lt;td class=""thumbnail""&gt;&lt;a href=""...""&gt;&lt;img src=""..."" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
...
</code></pre>

<p>An included javascript file contains the code to make the images draggable</p>

<pre><code>$$( "".thumbnail a img"" ).each(
  function( img )
  {
    new Draggable( img, {revert:true} );
  }
);
</code></pre>

<p>and a simple handler to detect the end of the drag</p>

<pre><code>Draggables.addObserver({
  onEnd:function( eventName, draggable, event )
  {
    // alert ( eventName ); // leaving this in stops IE from following the link
    event.preventDefault(); // Does Not Work !!!
    // event.stop(); // Does Not Work either !!!
  }
});
</code></pre>

<p>My idea is that when the image is clicked the link should be followed but when it is dragged something else should happen.</p>

<p>In fact what happens is that when the image is dragged the handler is called but the link is still followed.</p>

<p>I guess that I'm cancelling the wrong event.</p>

<p>How can I prevent the link from being followed after the element is dragged?
<hr /></p>

<p>edit: added event.stop after trying greystate's suggestion
<hr /></p>

<p>I now have a basic solution that works for FireFox, Apache, etc. See my own answer below.</p>

<p>But I am still looking for a solution for IE7 (and hopefully IE6).</p>

<p>Another problem when dragging images in IE is that the image becomes detached from the mouse pointer when the tool tip appears, you have to release the mouse and click again on the image to re-acquire the drag. So I'm also looking for any ideas that might help resolve that problem.</p>

"<p>I'm using CakePHP for a small web app and on one form page there's a dropdown to select a job number. I'd like to update two text fields based on the job number selected in the dropdown using jQuery (I'm also open to using the default ajax helper but I didn't have a lot of success with it). </p>

<p>Here's my jQuery snippet:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;
    $(document).ready(function() {
        $('#job_id').change(function() {
            $.post('/surveys/jobdetails', {id: $(this).attr('id')});
        })
        .change();
    });
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><code>jobdetails</code> is a method in my controller that gets the current job based on the job id passed in. However, it doesn't get called when the dropdown changes value. I tried substituting an alert function in place of .post and that worked, so onchange is being called correctly.</p>

<p>Here's the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> I'm trying to update:</p>

<pre><code>echo ""&lt;div id='job_details'&gt;"";
echo $form-&gt;label('jobtitle', 'Job Title');
echo ""&lt;input type='text' name='jobtitle' id='jobtitle'&gt;"";
echo $form-&gt;label('department', 'Department');
echo ""&lt;input type='text' name='department' id='department'&gt;"";
echo ""&lt;/div&gt;"";
</code></pre>

<p>I want to set the value of each text field to be the corresponding value for the job returned from the ajax call. There's a lot of really good jQuery and CakePHP documentation but I haven't found anything that quite covers what I'm trying to do. Can anyone see what I'm doing wrong? Is there a better way to use ajax to update a div with CakePHP?</p>
","16417","Paolo Bergantino","<p>Your CakePHP controller needs to look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>function jobdetails() {
    // get the data however you want
    // $_POST['id'] will have the job_id
    print json_encode(array(
        'jobtitle' =&gt; $jobtitle,
        'department'=&gt;$dept
    ));
    exit;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then you need to add a callback to your <code>$.post</code> that will actually update the fields:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function() {
    $('#job_id').change(function() {
        $.post('/surveys/jobdetails', {id: $(this).attr('id')}, function(json) {
            // now that we are in the callback,
            // the variable json is an object
            // with the values we passed above
            // so we can update the fields with the new values
            $('#jobtitle').val(json.jobtitle);
            $('#department').val(json.department);
        });
    })
    .change();
});
</code></pre>

<p>I also recommend you get a tool like Firebug so you can see the progress of your AJAX requests and make sure the server is returning what you think its returning. It makes testing and debugging anything related to AJAX way easier.</p>

<p>In my opinion this is more elegant than outputting the whole DIV to update, but if you want to go that route you would just use jQuery's <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Ajax/load"" rel=""nofollow""><code>.load</code></a> to achieve what you want.</p>

<p>This code was modified from an answer provided in <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/524696/how-to-create-a-style-tag-with-javascript/524717"">this question</a> which is very similar to what you asked. Whenever you need to change the position of all .Foo elements, you can just call changeFoo(newLeftValue, newTopValue); - the first time around it will create the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> element and add it to the <code>&lt;head</code>> of the document. Subsequent calls will just empty the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> element that was already added and add the new rule.</p>

"<p>Heads up: I am quite new to Javascript and have so far only written very basic scripts based on jQuery.
I am a quick study though..</p>

<p>What I am after is a way to:</p>

<p>1) identify  tags</p>

<p>2) read the img tags </p>

<p>3) wrap the  tag with an <code>&lt;a href&gt;</code> tag with a dynamic link based on the src of the img.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;img src=""../../img_T/Culture/C_01/c_01_abb_005.jpg"" width=""310"" height=""180"" alt=""image1""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>should become</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href=""../../img_L/Culture/C_01/c_01_abb_005.jpg""&gt;&lt;img src=""../../img_T/Culture/C_01/c_01_abb_005.jpg"" width=""310"" height=""180"" alt=""C 01 Abb 005""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I am thinking that reading the src of each image and writing it to a variable, then reading that variable and replacing the /img_T/ with /img_L/ and then writing that to a new variable which can then be simply added to each href.</p>

<p>This is how far I have gotten, but this does not work at all:</p>

<pre><code>/* in the comments 'xxx' represents a different unique image string */
/* This should get the &lt;img src=""../img_T/xxx"" /&gt; string as text and store it. */
var $imgSrc        =    $("".displaywrapper img"").attr(""src"");

/* This part should use the above sourced &lt;img src=""../img_T/xxx"" string and replace ../img_T/ of the src with ../img_L/ and store it in var = imgLink. */
var imgLink        =    $imgSrc.text().replace(""img_T"",""img_L"");

/* This part should then wrap the &lt;img src=""../img_T/xxx"" /&gt; so it becomes &lt;a href=""..img_L/xxx""&gt;&lt;img src=""../img_T/xxx"" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; */
$("".displaywrapper img"").each(function(){.wrap(""&lt;a href=""imgLink""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;"")});
</code></pre>

<p>Another question related to the solution...</p>

<p>If i like to ""delete"" the  and remplace it with the table..</p>

<p>i dont like to make an empty table..</p>

<p>here is the code... maybe not ""optimized"" but it work</p>

<p>$('#texte').append('');
$('#where_my_table_goes').append(table);
$('#my_oddly_formatted_list').remove();</p>

<p>anything beter ?</p>

<hr>

<p>no no no, since the question/answer become and plugin ti great... but dont work anymore...</p>

<p>here is the bug... i like to call the plugin (tablerize) when the clic event is toggle and REMPLACE THE WHOLE UL by the table... wich it dont do</p>

<p>Here is the little snippet of code : </p>


    $(document).ready(function() {

        $('#texte > h1').next().hide(500);  
        $('#texte > h1').click(function() {
        $(this > ul).tablerize();
        $(this).toggle(500);
        });
    });


<p>not surprising it dont work.. i screw something for sure... and i tweek the plugin with no luck !...</p>

<p>i really like to keep that code : </p>

<p>$(""texte"").append('');
$(#where_my_table_goes"">').append(table);
$('#my_oddly_formatted_list').remove();</p>

<p>that can become: </p>

<p>remove the ul
append the div to (this)
put the table into that div</p>

<p>do i even need a div ?</p>

","16417","Paolo Bergantino","<p>This is how you do it, if you have HTML that looks like this:</p>

    &lt;li&gt;Value G4|Value H1|Value I4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then with jQuery you could write a plugin like this:</p>

<pre><code>jQuery.fn.tablerize = function() {
        return this.each(function() {
                var table = $('&lt;table&gt;');
                var tbody = $('&lt;tbody&gt;');
                $(this).find('li').each(function(i) {
                        var values = $(this).html().split('*');
                        if(i == 0) {
                                var thead = $('&lt;thead&gt;');
                                var tr = $('&lt;tr&gt;');
                                $.each(values, function(y) {
                                        tr.append($('&lt;th&gt;').html(values[y]));
                                });
                                table.append(thead.append(tr));
                        } else {
                           var tr = $('&lt;tr&gt;');
                           $.each(values, function(y) {
                                   tr.append($('&lt;td&gt;').html(values[y]));
                           });
                           tbody.append(tr);
                        }
                });
                $(this).after(table.append(tbody)).remove();
        });
};
</code></pre>

<p>Which you could then call any of the following ways:</p>

<pre><code>// tablerize all UL elements in the page
$('ul').tablerize();

// only UL elements with class 'odd_list'
$('ul.odd_list').tablerize();

// individually tablerize all the lists
$('#my_oddly_formatted_list1').tablerize();
$('#my_oddly_formatted_list2').tablerize();
$('#my_oddly_formatted_list3').tablerize();
</code></pre>

<p>As far as sorting and so on, there are many <a href=""http://plugins.jquery.com/project/Plugins/category/54"">plugins</a> available to give this functionality to a table.</p>

<h2>** EDIT **</h2>

<p>The problem with your code is in these lines:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function() {
    /*$('#texte &gt; h1').next().hide(1000); */ 
    $('#texte &gt; h1').click(function() {
        $(this).tablerize();
        /*$(this).next().toggle(500);*/
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>tablerize</code> plugin I wrote expects a <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> element to tablerize. When you pass it <code>this</code> you are passing it the <code>h1</code> that was matched, not the <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>. If you replace this line:</p>

<pre><code>$(this).tablerize();
</code></pre>

<p>With this line, which will find the UL element immediately after the header:</p>

<pre><code>$(this).next('ul').tablerize();
</code></pre>

<p>It should work as you intend.</p>

<p>Also:</p>

"<p>Is there a way to get jQuery to get information to and from a file? Is it possible? How?</p>
","16417","Paolo Bergantino","<p>No, JavaScript doesn't have access to writing files as this would be a huge security risk to say the least. If you wanted to get/store information server-side, though, you can certainly make an Ajax call to a PHP/ASP/Python/etc. script that can then get/store the data in the server. If you meant store data on the client machine, this is impossible with JavaScript alone. I suspect Flash/Java may be able to, but I am not sure.</p>

<p>If you are only trying to store a small amount of information for an unreliable period of time regarding a specific user, I think you want cookies. I am not sure from your question what you are trying to accomplish, though.</p>

"<p>I have two nearly identical javascript functions that are used to initiate a jquery $.get call. The arguments to the function are passed to the script being called.</p>

<p>The problem is that one set of calls requires an additional argument that the other does not.</p>

<p>To accomplish this I'm using the two nearly identical javascript functions I've mentioned. Here they are:</p>

<pre><code>function process(url, domid, domain, scan_id)
{
    $.get(url,
    {
        domain: domain,
        scan_id: scan_id

        $(domid).html(data);

    },

    function(data)
    {
        $(domid).html(data);
    });
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, the 2nd function merely accepts an additional argument called 'type' which is then passed through the $.get call.</p>

<p>I want to combine these two functions, but I'm not sure how I can optionally include that 3rd argument in that ( array / object / whatever it is in { }  ( yes, javascript noob) ) that's being passed in $.get.</p>

<ul>
<li>I recommend giving a class to all the input elements you want to include with this behavior and doing a selector of input.myfields as it is faster/cleaner.</li>
<li>Also, as of jQuery 1.3, the <code>@</code> in the selector is not supported. <code>:text</code> is shorthand for what you want, if are you sticking to selecting them that way.</li>

","16417","Paolo Bergantino","<p>You shouldn't use <code>htmlentities</code> when saving it. You should use <code>htmlentities</code> when displaying it. The rule of thumb is not to encode/sanitize the data until you need to. If you do <code>htmlentities</code> on it when you save then you have to do <code>html_entity_decode</code> on the text when the user wants to edit the input. So you sanitize for what you need and nothing more. When saving it, you need to sanitize for SQL injection, so you <code>mysql_real_escape_string</code> it. When displaying, you need to sanitize for XSS, so you <code>htmlentities</code> it.</p>

<p>Also, I am not sure if you saw Darryl Hein's comment, but you really do not want magic_quotes enabled. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic%5Fquotes#Criticism"">They are a bad, bad, thing</a> and have been deprecated as of PHP 5.3 and will be gone altogether in PHP 6.</p>

"<p>Say you have a 10 element indexed array and you want to place an element somewhere in the middle (say index 3). Then I want to have the rest of the array shift and thus be 11 elements long. Is there an easy way to do this?</p>

"<p>This seems so tricky to me that I think I am overlooking something simple here. 
Can you help me find it?</p>

<p>Basically, the situation is this 
(variables where the name is not important are named with a capital letter)  :</p>

<pre><code>$('a').filter('somecriteria').each(function() {
    var self = $(this);
    self.click(function() {
        B.animate({ something: somevalue }, { duration: ""fast"", complete: function(){

            }  
        });
        return false;
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>Notes: 
How can I let this <code>return</code> be the <code>return</code> that is sent from <code>click()</code> so that the user is taken to the new page only after animate() has fully completed (NB: in my real code I have three animate()'s chained together). 
I need to do this because the animation is cut off and the new page is loaded prematurely. The animation only comes to full effect when return false is sent from click() until the animation really ends. </p>

<p>I tried capturing the <code>href</code> attribute of the link and doing a <code>window.location = capturedlink</code> instead of <code>return true</code>. 
This works, but if possible I want to avoid that because some people have disabled changing location because of security concerns. </p>

<p>Or is there another way of keeping jQuery changing to a new URL in the middle of an animation?</p>

<p>Thank you very much for checking out this question.</p>

"<p>It might seem it has been asked numerous times, but in fact it hasn't. I did my research, and now I'm eager to hear <em>others' opinions</em>.</p>

<p>I have experience with <strong>PHP 5</strong>, both with functional and object oriented programming methods. I created a few feature-minimalistic websites.</p>

<p>Professionals may agree about PHP not being a programming language that encourages good development habits. (I believe it's not the task of the tool, but this doesn't matter.) Furthermore, <strong>its performance is also controversial</strong> and often said to be poor compared to competitors.</p>

<p>In the <a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/02/podcast-42/"" rel=""nofollow"">42nd podcast at Stack Overflow blog</a> a developer from Poland asked what language he should learn in order to improve his skills. Jeff and Joel suggested that <strong>every one of them would help</strong>, altough there are specific ones that are better in some ways.
Despite they made some great points, it didn't help me that much.</p>

<p>From a beginner point of view, <s>there are not</s> one may not see (correction suggested by <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/users/10661/s-lott"">S. Lott</a>) many differences between <strong>Perl &amp; Python</strong>. I would like You to emphasize their strenghts and weaknesses and name a few unique services.</p>

<p>Of course, this wouldn't be fair as I could also check both of them. So here's my wishlist and requirements to help You help me.</p>

<p>First of all, I'd like to follow <strong>OOP structures</strong> and use it fundamentally. I partly planned a multiuser <strong>CMS</strong> using MySQL and XML, so the greater the implementations are, the better. Due to its foreseen nature, <strong>string manipulation</strong> will be used intensively.</p>

<p>If there aren't great differences, comparisons should probably mention syntax and other tiny details that don't matter in the first place.</p>

<p>So, here's my question: which one should I try <strong>first</strong> -- Perl || Python?</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Both Perl and Python have their own fans, which is great. I'd like to say I'm grateful for all participation -- there is no trace of any flame war.</p>

<p>I accepted the most valued answer, although there are many great mini-articles below. As suggested more often, I will go with Python first. Then I'll try Perl later on. Let me see which one fits my mind better.</p>

<p>During the development of my special CMS, I'm going to ask more regarding programming doubts -- because developers now can count on each other! Thank you.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> There were some people suggesting to choose Ruby or Java instead. Java has actually disappointed me. Maybe it has great features, maybe it hasn't. I wouldn't enjoy using it.</p>

<p>In addition, I was told to use Ruby. So far, most of the developers I communicate with have quite bad opinion about Ruby. I'll see it myself, but that's the last element on my priority list.</p>
","16417","Paolo Bergantino","<p>Honestly, the ""majority"" of my programming has been in Perl and PHP and I recently decided to do my latest project in Python, and I must admit it is very nice to program with. I was hesitant of the whole no curly braces thing as that's what I've always done, but it is really very clean. At the end of the day, though, you can make good web applications with all 3, but if you are dead-set on dropping PHP to try something new I would recommend Python and the Django framework. </p>

        $(""#txtBody"").val(data.body);

    error: function (XMLHttpRequest, textStatus, errorThrown) {
        alert(""XMLHttpRequest=""+XMLHttpRequest.responseText+""\ntextStatus=""+textStatus+""\nerrorThrown=""+errorThrown);
    }

<p>The ajax hits the error ans alerts the following:</p>

<pre><code>XMLHttpRequest=[{""iId"":""1"",""heading"":""Management Services"",""body"":""&lt;h1&gt;Program Overview &lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h1&gt;January 29, 2009&lt;/h1&gt;""}]

textStatus=parseerror

errorThrown=undefined
</code></pre>

<p>Then I tried a simple JQuery get call to return the JSON using the following code:</p>

<pre><code>$.get(jURL,function(data){
    var json = eval(""(""+data+"");"");
    wId = json.iId;
    $(""#txtHeading"").val(json.heading);
    $(""#txtBody"").val(json.body);
    $(""#add"").slideUp(""slow"");
    $(""#edit"").slideDown(""slow"");
})
</code></pre>

<p>The .get returns the JSON, but the eval comes up with errors no matter how I've modified the JSON (content-type header, other variations of the format, etc.)</p>

<p>What I've come up with is that there seem to be an issue returning the HTML in the JSON and getting it parsed.  However, I have hope that I may have missed something that would allow me to get this data via JSON.  Does anyone have any ideas?</p>

"<p>In a nutshell: how do I access the methods of a class that is instantiated by a method of a different class?</p>

<p>There is a bit of code I am looking at right now that does the following (altering the code is not an option, btw. It isn't mine... I'm just decipher it):</p>

<p>A class has a method that instantiates a different class. It looks something like this:</p>

<pre>
// this file is named fooClassHere.php

class Foo{
    public $meh;

    function bar(){
        $something = new Baz;
        $this->meh = $something->getStuff();
    }
}
</pre>

<p>What I am trying to figure out is how to access the methods of this instantiated class Baz. Another page contains something like the following:</p>

<pre>
include 'bazClassHere.php';
include 'fooClassHere.php';

$a = new Foo;
$a->bar();
</pre>

<p>So shouldn't all of Baz be available now in some manner (and not just getStuff() which I assigned to $this->meh)? The Foo and Baz classes are included, the code instantiates Foo and then calls Foo's method bar() which in turn instantiates the Baz class. Obviously the following will display data returned by Baz's getStuff() method:</p>

<pre>
var_dump($a->meh);
</pre>

<p>But I'd like to access <strong>all</strong> of Baz's available methods without going through the intermediate step of manually assigning them like I did inside Foo's bar method: <pre>$this->meh = $something->getStuff()</pre></p>

<p>Maybe something like (but of course this doesn't work):<pre>
$a = new Foo;<br />
$a->bar();                 //instantiates Baz as $something
$a->something->fromBaz();  //$something is an instance of Baz, yes? No?
</pre></p>

<p>I hope this makes sense and I didn't confuse the issue with my notes. Ack! >_&lt;</p>

        $this-&gt;something = new Baz;

"<p>I just read codes of a web product that is supposed to support multiple modern browser(including FireFox 3.X, Safari 3.X and IE7+, but not including IE6-). The HTML code uses <strong><em>div</em></strong> instead of <strong><em>table</em></strong> to create table-like effects. Actually, the <strong><em>div</em></strong>'s are organized like this:</p>

<pre><code>   &lt;div&gt;
         &lt;div&gt;
              &lt;div style=""float:left"" id=""header1""&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;div style=""float:left""&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;div style=""float:left""&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
         &lt;/div&gt;
         &lt;div&gt;
              &lt;div style=""float:left"" id=""header2""&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;div style=""float:left""&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;div style=""float:left""&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
         &lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>There is a piece of onload JavaScript code to read all ""headerX"" elements, calculate their max <strong><em>offsetWidth</em></strong>. Then assign the max <strong><em>offsetWidth</em></strong> to each of them. In this way, the div is well aligned to be like table.</p>

<p>Actually, I don't think this is a good way to go, but I'm told that the product is designed this way to make it <strong><em>cross-browser supported</em></strong>, because <strong>table</strong> behaves different in different browsers.</p>

<p>I'm not convinced. So, the question. Besides the approach mentioned above, is there any better to make table-like layout for all popular browsers?</p>
","16417","Paolo Bergantino","<p>It looks like almost everyone misunderstood your question (or maybe I did).</p>

<p>It sounds like the web product is trying to display tabular data using divs and their reason for it is that it is the best way to make it cross-browser compatible. Not only is this false, by bringing javascript into the equation they are instantly making it less compatible across your users. If a user has javascript disabled the divs will be a mess. It is best to use <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> for this situation, as it actually works rather well across browsers, which is why it used to be so attractive to design a layout.</p>

<p>What most people are referring to in their answers is the old sin of making website layouts using tables, which I don't think your question really covers. Anyhow, this is improper because the <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> tag is not semantically relevant to hold layout content. It is always best to keep the semantic meaning of your HTML document. What this web product is doing is the same sin, but in a reverse way: they are using the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tag to display tabular data, when the <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> is there for that.</p>

<p>At this point, <code>pieces</code> is an array and <code>pieces.length</code> contains the size of the array so to get the last element of the array, you check <code>pieces[pieces.length-1]</code>. If there are no commas or spaces it will simply output the string as it was given.</p>

<p>What it is doing:</p>

<p>It is selecting all the <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code> elements inside the <code>&lt;tbody&gt;</code> of the <code>table.grid</code> context. The filter function allows you to filter elements based on what you return, either true to keep or false to discard. So inside the filter we get all the children of the tr, get the 2nd <code>&lt;td&gt;</code>, and return whether or not its text is equal to 'Open' - if it is, it would return true, and we could keep the parent <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code> in the selector. All that is left would then just be <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code> with  Open status, so we can add a class to mark them as such.</p>

"<p>What's the best way to prevent javascript injections in a VB.NET Web Application?  Is there some way of disabling javascript on the pageload event?</p>

<p>Recently, part of the security plan for our vb.net product was to simply disable buttons on the page that weren't available to the specific user.  However, I informed the guy who thought of the idea that typing</p>

<p><code>javascript:alert(document.getElementById(""Button1"").disabled="""")</code> </p>

<p>in the address bar would re-enable the button.  I'm sure that someone else has ran into issues like this before, so any help is appreciated.  Thanks!</p>

<p><b>Update:</b>
Aside from validating user input, how can I protect the website from being toyed with from the address bar?</p>

<p>Thanks for the input! I appreciate it!</p>
","16417","Paolo Bergantino","<p>Any changes you make to the client-side behavior of your application are superficial and not secure at all. You should not rely upon these. They are nice to stop 99% of users, but it is trivially easy to bypass them. You should be checking whether a user has the right privileges for the action on the server side when the action is called, so that if someone did decide to re-enable the button themselves they would not be able to do whatever the button is meant to do. You have no control over what someone can do to the page with javascript, so you should never trust anything coming from the client.</p>

<p><strong>Response to update:</strong> You can't in any practical way, which is exactly what the problem is. Once the website is in their browser, it's a free-for-all and they can have a go at it. Which is why your program should validate everything server side, every time.</p>

I then bind a trigger to fire everytime the courses <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> is changed. When this happens, I find the course which was selected and loop through all its times appending them to the times <code>&lt;select&gt;</code>. </p>

#message span {
    text-align: center;
    width: 95%;

    padding-left:3px;
    padding-right:3px

.close-notify a {

I am not sure where that is coming from as you didn't post that part of the markup, but if the <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> will end up being inside this element, you can change this line:</p>

<pre><code>var bs = document.getElementsByTagName(""b"");

<p>To this:</p>

<pre><code>var bs = jobContents.getElementsByTagName(""b"");

"<p>I'm writing a script which manages a very large table. When a user clicks a table cell, I would like to know which cell they clicked.
e.g</p>

<pre><code>--------------
|     |      |
|     | Click|
--------------
</code></pre>

<p>should give me a cell reference of (1, 1).</p>

<p>Any way I could do this with javascript. The page it's running on uses jquery for other purposes, so any jquery based solutions are good aswell.</p>

<p>EDIT: To clarify, the top left cell is (0, 0). For performance reasons, the event needs to bound to the <em>table</em>, not the tds.</p>
","16417","Paolo Bergantino","<p>This is done very easily using the <code>target</code> property of the <code>event</code> object:</p>

<pre><code>$('#mytable').click(function(e) {
    var tr = $(e.target).parent('tr');
    var x = $('tr', this).index(tr);
    var y = tr.children('td').index($(e.target));
    alert(x + ',' + y);
});
</code></pre>

<p>This approach allows you to only bind 1 event handler to the entire table and then figure out which table cell was clicked. This is known as event delegation and can be much more efficient in the right situation, and this one fits the bill. Using this you avoid binding an event to each <code>&lt;td&gt;</code>, and it does not require hard-coding coordinates. So, if your table looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;table id='mytable'&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;hi&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;heya&lt;/td&gt;

      &lt;td&gt;weee&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>It will alert the coordinates on click. You can do whatever with that. :)</p>

<p>If you find performance to be too slow (depending on just how large your table is) you would then have to resort to hardcoding or a combination of the two, maybe only hard coding the <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code> index, as that would be the slowest to get, and then getting the <code>&lt;td&gt;</code> index dynamically. Finally, if all this coordinate business is completely unnecessary and what you really just wanted was a reference to the clicked <code>&lt;td&gt;</code>, you would just do this:</p>

<pre><code>$('#mytable').click(function(e) {
    var td = $(e.target);

","16417","Paolo Bergantino","<p>I need more details to offer actual code, but you might want to look into <a href=""http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/examples/event/event-delegation.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Event Delegation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Event delegation refers to the use of a single event listener on a parent object to listen for events happening on its children (or deeper descendants). Event delegation allows developers to be sparse in their application of event listeners while still reacting to events as they happen on highly specific targets. This proves to be a key strategy for maintaining high performance in event-rich web projects, where the creation of hundreds of event listeners can quickly degrade performance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A quick, basic example:</p>

<p>Say you have a DIV with images, like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""container""&gt;
    &lt;img src=""happy.jpg""&gt;
    &lt;img src=""sad.jpg""&gt;
    &lt;img src=""laugh.jpg""&gt;
    &lt;img src=""boring.jpg""&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But instead of 4 images, you have 100, or 200. You want to bind a click event to images so that X action is performed when the user clicks on it. Most people's first code might look like this:</p>

<pre><code>$('#container img').click(function() {
    performAction(this);
});
</code></pre>

<p>This is going to bind a crapload of event handlers that will bog down the performance of your page. With Event Delegation, you can do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>$('#container').click(function(e) {
    if($(e.target)[0].nodeName.toUpperCase() == 'IMG') {
        performAction(e.target);
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>This will only bind 1 event to the actual container, you can then figure out what was clicked by using the event's <code>target</code> property and delegate accordingly. This is still kind of a pain, though, and you can actually get this significant performance improvement without doing all this by using jQuery's <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Events/live"" rel=""nofollow""><code>live</code></a> function:</p>

<pre><code>$('#container img').live('click', function() {
     performAction(this);
});

","16417","Paolo Bergantino","<p>You are looking for the <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Selectors/hidden""><code>:hidden</code></a> selector</p>

<p>Please note that the proper way of selecting an element by ID is simply:</p>

<pre><code>$(""#test1"");
</code></pre>

<p>Doing it the way you are doing is making jQuery do unnecessary parsing and is much slower.</p>

<p>If you want to select <code>#test1</code> only if it is hidden, you do this:</p>

<pre><code>$(""#test1:hidden"");
</code></pre>

<p>If you wanted to select all <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> elements that are hidden under <code>#p1</code>, you do this:</p>

<pre><code>$(""span:hidden"", ""#p1"");
</code></pre>

<p>As noted in the comments, the opposite of this selector is the <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Selectors/visible""><code>:visible</code></a> selector:</p>

<pre><code>$(""span:visible"", ""#p1"");
</code></pre>

<p>Would then select any visible <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> elements in the element <code>#p1</code>.</p>

"<p>I have a form with a standard reset button coded thusly:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type=""reset"" class=""button standard"" value=""Clear"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Trouble is, said form is of the multi-stage sort, so if a user fills out a stage &amp; then returns later, the 'remembered' values for the various fields won't reset when the Clear button is clicked.</p>

<p>I'm thinking that attaching a jQuery function to loop over all the fields and clear them 'manually' would do the trick. I'm already using jQuery within the form, but am only just getting up to speed &amp; so am not sure how to go about this, other than individually referencing each field by ID, which doesn't seem very efficient.</p>

<p>TIA for any help.</p>

<p>So, two years after I originally answered this question I come back to see that it has pretty much turned into a big mess. I feel it's about time I come back to it and make my answer truly correct since it is the most upvoted + accepted.</p>

<p>For the record, Titi's answer is wrong as it is not what the original poster asked for - it is correct that it is possible to reset a form using the native reset() method, but this question is trying to clear a form off of remembered values that would remain in the form if you reset it this way. This is why a ""manual"" reset is needed. I assume most people ended up in this question from a Google search and are truly looking for the reset() method, but it does not work for the specific case the OP is talking about.</p>

<p>My <strong>original</strong> answer was this:</p>

<pre><code>// not correct, use answer below
$(':input','#myform')
.not(':button, :submit, :reset, :hidden')
.val('')
.removeAttr('checked')
.removeAttr('selected');
</code></pre>

<p>Which might work for a lot of cases, including for the OP, but as pointed out in the comments and in other answers, will clear radio/checkbox elements from any value attributes.</p>

<p>A more <strong>correct</strong> answer (but not perfect) is:</p>

<pre><code>function resetForm($form) {
    $form.find('input:text, input:password, input:file, select, textarea').val('');
    $form.find('input:radio, input:checkbox')
         .removeAttr('checked').removeAttr('selected');
}

// to call, use:
resetForm($('#myform')); // by id, recommended
resetForm($('form[name=myName]')); // by name
</code></pre>

<p>Using the <code>:text</code>, <code>:radio</code>, etc. selectors by themselves is considered bad practice by jQuery as they end up evaluating to <code>*:text</code> which makes it take much longer than it should. I do prefer the whitelist approach and wish I had used it in my original answer. Anyhow, by specifying the <code>input</code> part of the selector, plus the cache of the form element, this should make it the best performing answer here.</p>

<p>This answer might still have some flaws if people's default for select elements is not an option that has a blank value, but it is certainly as generic as it is going to get and this would need to be handled on a case-by-case basis.</p>

"<p>I'm trying to select elements with multiple conditions, for example I'm doing the following at the moment:</p>

","16417","Paolo Bergantino","<pre><code>$('input:visible', '#myspan').find(':checked').each(function() {

"<p>I'm using jquery's load() to get some content into a div, and I want to run an other function in the ""background"" until load() finishes.

<p>Simply put: I don't know where to look for ""Line 8; Char 9"" as the Source of the html only has a meta tag in line 8.</p>

"<p>I've got this little snippet that I use for row highlighting on an XSLT page that has to use an onclick event to postback some data, but because the row isn't a link I have to make sure there's a hand cursor as well as the row being highlighted so the users understand it's clickable and what row they're on.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;

"<p>This is a snippet from my <code>index.php</code> page, where I'm displaying a menu with three HTML links. </p>

<p>Selecting a menu item defines the page parameter, which the PHP templating logic then loads, populating into <code>&lt;div id=""main""&gt;</code>.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""span-24"" id=""menu""&gt;

<p>This solution works fine, but I'm worried that as I add more pages and have more page parameters to track, this approach will become difficult to maintain with the various PHP <code>require()</code> / <code>require_once()</code> method calls.</p>

<p>I also have jQuery available and I was wondering what could be the benefits or drawbacks of just using a AJAX based query to render the HTML for <code>&lt;div id=""main""&gt;</code>. </p>

<p>I think using AJAX might be a better solution, since I'll have more flexibility in the page that I can call and which parameters I can pass within the AJAX call.</p>

<p>I know PHP and the AJAX can be used together, but if you were starting this type of project, how would you do it?</p>
","16417","Paolo Bergantino","<p>You don't want to do this. AJAX is nice and all but this would be misusing it. It would not only needlessly make the website inaccessible to people with Javascript disabled (which I'm sure you're aware of), it would also kill the navigational standard of the web on your website. How could someone send a link to a friend to check out the Races page, then? How can I go back and forth between pages? There's workarounds to this, but it is not worth it. You are better suited to just re-factor your PHP code so it is dynamic while safe in including what you want.</p>

<p>With the <code>:visible</code> filter it would only do the <code>slideUp</code> on whichever element(s) are visible so they can then be hidden with <code>slideUp</code>. I am guessing this is what you are looking for since there's no point in hiding an already hidden element. If you want to momentarily show the hidden one and then <code>slideUp</code> it, you can just switch my original answer from <code>hide()</code> to <code>show()</code> and then do the <code>slideUp</code>.</p>

","16417","Paolo Bergantino","<p>I think a really cool use of server-side Javascript that isn't used nearly often enough is for data validation. With it, you can write one javascript file to validate a form, check it on the client side, then check it again on the server side because we shouldn't trust anything on the client side. It lets you keep your validation rules DRY. Quite handy.</p>

<p>How could I do the same for anonymous (not logged in) users?  There is no request.user for anonymous users, but the Django documentation says that using the ""session"" middleware you can do the same thing as the above code.

","16417","Paolo Bergantino","<p>This is what I do, using context processors:</p>

<p><code>project/application/context.py</code> (check for messages and add them to the context):</p>

    if 'message' in request.session:
        message_type = request.session.get('message_type', 'error')
        messages = {'message': request.session['message'],
                    'message_type': message_type}
        del request.session['message']
        if 'message_type' in request.session:
            del request.session['message_type']
    return messages
</code></pre>

<p><code>project/settings.py</code> (add the context to the <code>TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS</code>):</p>

<pre><code>TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS = (
    ""django.core.context_processors.request"",
    ""django.core.context_processors.debug"",
    ""django.core.context_processors.media"",
    ""django.core.context_processors.auth"",
    ""project.application.context.messages"",  
)
</code></pre>

<p>With the above the function <code>messages</code> will be called on every request and whatever it returns will be added to the template's context. With this in place, if I want to give a user a message, I can do this:</p>

<pre><code>def my_view(request):
    if someCondition:
        request.session['message'] = 'Some Error Message'
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, in a template you can just check if there are errors to display:</p>

<pre><code>{% if message %}
    &lt;div id=""system_message"" class=""{{ message_type }}""&gt;
        {{ message }}
    &lt;/div&gt;
{% endif %}
</code></pre>

<p>The message type is just used to style depending on what it is (""error"",""notice"",""success"") and the way that this is setup you can only add 1 message at a time for a user, but that is all I really ever need so it works for me. It could be easily changed to allow for multiple messages and such.</p>

<p>Your thinking is right; the reason it is not working is because AJAX is an asynchronous process and as you fire off the getJSON function javascript keeps on trucking along. Your solution doesn't work because making it a named callback is not changing the fact that it won't be fired until you've already tried to initialize the Menu. All my solution is doing is moving the Menu initilization code INSIDE the callback, as it is then and only then that you will have access to the filled out applicationList.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM users, teams WHERE users.team_id = teams.team_id ORDER BY users.last_name
</code></pre>

<p>Using the prefix 'nx_', it should change to </p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM nx_users, nx_ teams WHERE nx_ users.team_id = nx_ teams.team_id ORDER BY nx_ users.last_name
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously it should handle other cases such as table aliases, joins, and other common MySQL commands.</p>

<p>Has anybody done this?</p>

<p>You will find the matching child record to be gone. This is, in my opinion, the best way to do it.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: To do this within 1 table, you would do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE parent (
    id INT NOT NULL,
    name varchar(250) not null,
    parent_id INT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (parent_id) REFERENCES parent(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
) ENGINE=INNODB
</code></pre>

<p>Then if you add two rows, one referencing the other:</p>

<pre><code>INSERT INTO parent (id,name,parent_id)
VALUES ('1', 'Test 1', NULL), ('2', 'Test 2', '1')
</code></pre>

<p>Then delete the parent row of the two:</p>

<pre><code>DELETE FROM parent WHERE id = 1;
</code></pre>

<p>You will find that it deletes the child row with <code>parent_id</code> of 1.</p>

"<p>I'm doing some home-brewed automated documentation, since I have a codebase which is not very standard in its layout, and I was wondering what the best way was to read a PHP file and grab the contents of a comment block. The only way I can think to do it is to open the file and read it line-by-line, but thought that maybe there was some built-in magic that would parse the document for me, similar to the Reflection functions.</p>

<p>The basic layout of each file is like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php // $Id$

 * Here is this script's documentation, with information in pseudo-javadoc

 * @attr    etc          etc etc

"<p>I have an interesting question about the way PHP evaluates boolean expressions.   When you have, for example,</p>

<pre><code>$expression = $expression1 and $expression2;
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>if ($expression1 and $expression2)
</code></pre>

<p>PHP first checks if <code>$expression1</code> evaluates to <strong><code>true</code></strong>. If this is not the case, then <code>$expression2</code> is simply skipped to avoid unnecessary calculations.  In a script I am writing, I have:</p>

<pre><code>if ($validator-&gt;valid(""title"") and $validator-&gt;valid(""text""))
</code></pre>

<p>I need to have the second statement (<code>$validator-&gt;valid(""text"")</code>) evaluated even if the first one evaluates to false.  I would like to ask you whether there is some easy way to force PHP to always evaluate both statements. Thank you!</p>
","16417","Paolo Bergantino","<p>This is known as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-circuit%5Fevaluation"">short circuit evaluation</a>, and to avoid it you need to do this, using a single <code>&amp;</code>:</p>

<pre><code>if($validator-&gt;valid(""title"") &amp; $validator-&gt;valid(""text"")) {

}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that this is not using <a href=""http://www.php.net/language.operators.logical"">logical operators</a> but actually <a href=""http://www.php.net/manual/en/language.operators.bitwise.php"">bitwise operators</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>They're operators that act on the binary representations of numbers. They do not take logical values (i.e., ""true"" or ""false"") as arguments without first converting them to the numbers 1 and 0 respectively. Nor do they return logical values, but numbers. Sure, you can later treat those numbers as though they were logical values (in which case 0 is cast to ""false"" and anything else is cast to ""true""), but that's a consequence of PHP's type casting rules, and nothing to do with the behavior of the operators.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As such, there is <em>some</em> debate as to whether it is good practice to use this side effect to circumvent short-circuit evaluation. I would personally at least put a comment that the &amp; is intentional, but if you want to be as pure as possible you should evaluate whether they are valid first and then do the if.</p>

"<p>I'm working on a windowing application for a website of mine. Right now, I have each individual window set up as a  in the body of the site. I add new windows by literally adding the appropriate code to the end of the body element, and delete them by removing that div. (I'm using jQuery for the underlying JavaScript architecture.)</p>

<p>I've found that for each window, I want to be able to store some values that aren't used directly. Say I maximize a window, I would want to save its old position and size so that when I un-maximize it, it returns to its old position and not just to somewhere random. So my real question here is, would it be legal to create custom CSS attributes (knowing full well that the browser would ignore them) with the sole purpose of keeping information like this on a per-div basis? Or would this be illegal, and should I look at another alternative?</p>

<p>I'm certainly <em>familiar</em> with methods of keeping all of this in an array so the system can run blind with it, but that's lovely and prone to errors and things, and it would still be a bit tricky to work with.</p>

"<p>I have recently been thinking alot about where to draw the line, and I wanted to get some answers from you experienced developers out there.  When is it acceptable to reference jQuery in a web app?</p>

<p>Some supporting arguments for <strong>Always Using jQuery</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>You can reference jQuery from Google's repository, where it might already be cached on the client, eliminating the extra hefty request</li>
<li>You don't have to deal with common cross-browser issues, as they are already taken care of</li>
<li>You enjoy writing the code because it is developer-friendly</li>
</ul>

<p>Some supporting arguments for <strong>Never Using jQuery</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Unsettling dependency of a third-party library, which could contain costly bugs, and could lead to unjustifiably poor performance</li>
<li>You have to learn a new syntax (just when you thought you had regular Javascript figured out...)</li>
<li>Even the simplest of tasks can perform poorly, because of the inherent complexity of the framework</li>
</ul>

<p>I listed arguments as part of the question because I do not wish to have answers weighing the arguments of both sides.  I am hoping for always/never answers, preferrably with test case scenarios (vague <em>or</em> detailed).</p>

<p>For example: ""If I ever need to do any AJAX requests in my web app, I always use jQuery"".</p>
","16417","Paolo Bergantino","<p>If I ever need to do anything past document.getElementById() in my web app, I always use jQuery.</p>

"<p>In my online store, I want to implement an interface like <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B000YVES0I"" rel=""nofollow"">Amazon's</a> for selecting product size and color. I.e., instead of radio buttons for the different sizes / colors, the user should see a bunch of little boxes, each containing either a swatch of color or the name of a size. When the user clicks a box, the border should change to indicate it's selected.</p>

<p>I'm using jQuery already, so I thought that the <a href=""http://jqueryui.com/demos/selectable/"" rel=""nofollow"">jQuery selectable widget</a> would be a natural way to implement this. Unfortunately, it doesn't appear to give you control over the maximum number of items the user can select, and therefore I couldn't limit users to selecting online one color / size in the UI.</p>

<p><strong>What's the best way to implement this functionality in a jQuery-friendly way (if possible)?</strong> </p>
","16417","","<p>It is possible to have jQuery selectable prevent selection, although unfortunately it is not very intuitive:</p>

<pre><code>$('#selectable').selectable({
   selected: function(event, ui) {
       var total = $(ui.selected).siblings('li.ui-selected').length + 1;
       if(total &gt; 1) {
           $(ui.selected).removeClass('ui-selected');
       }
   }
});
</code></pre>

<p>That will stop anything past 1 selection being made on a selectable widget.</p>

<p>The rest is just customizing it for your specific needs.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.rootspot.com/stackoverflow/amazon/"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>Check out a working demo</strong></a>. There is a lot of repetition for things done to sizes and colors that you can probably get rid of but I wanted to keep them separate because I'd imagine things could change between the two.

<p>Any thoughts on how I might accomplish this? Thank you for your help.</p>
","16417","","<p>This is the wrong way of doing it; PHP can handle array syntax in a variable name. This makes it much easier to handle. It is also unnecessary to call the server to clone the form. You should name your fields like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form&gt;
    &lt;div id=""originalCredit""&gt;
    &lt;input name=""title[]""  type=""text"" value=""""&gt;
    &lt;input name=""productionCompany[]"" type=""text"" value=""""&gt;
    &lt;input name=""year[]"" type=""text"" value=""""&gt;
    &lt;input name=""role[]"" type=""text"" value=""""&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;a href=""#"" id=""addCredit""&gt;add another credit&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And then your Javascript can be like this:</p>

<pre><code>$(function() {
    $('#addCredit').click(function() {
        var newCredit = $('#originalCredit').clone(); // create new set
        newCredit.find('input').val(''); // empty input fields
        $(this).before(newCredit); // append at the end
        return false;
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>When the form is finally sent to the server, because the variables are in the format of <code>name[]</code> PHP will recognize they are an array and then you can do this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;? foreach($_POST['title'] as $k =&gt; $v) { ?&gt;
    Title: &lt;?=$_POST['title'][$k]?&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    Company: &lt;?=$_POST['productionCompany'][$k]?&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    Year: &lt;?=$_POST['year'][$k]?&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    Role: &lt;?=$_POST['role'][$k]?&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;? } ?&gt;

"<p>I'm working on a new portfolio site at <a href=""http://www.nitrohandsome.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nitrohandsome.com</a>, and am using the experience to cut my teeth on jQuery. I'm using the latest build and jcarouselite along with the easing extension on my main page for a nifty carousel effect. It works fine in most browsers, but when I started testing in IE (7 and 8, haven't started optimizing for 6.5) I find that jQuery does not execute code as soon as the document is loaded. Rather, it seems to wait until one moves the mouse on to the body of html itself. This causes my carousel to display like a list and my main menu buttons to not render properly until the user moves the mouse. I used <a href=""http://www.browsershots.org"" rel=""nofollow"">browsershots.org</a> to check if it was only happening on my machine, but sadly not. Can anyone shed some light on this for me?

All things being equal, I'd probably go with the Javascript solution over this, but I've used this in the past with success. The cool thing about this solution is that it comes with a nicer interface such as loading indicators and thumbnails and such. At this point, though, you're asking for a user to have Flash + Javascript available, which may not work in some situations.</li>
<li>Using Silverlight instead of Flash, although I wouldn't really consider this as a viable solution, as it has a much lower penetration rate than the other two solutions.</li>
</ul>
"
"<p>So, I have a form that consists of 4 inputs, username, password, email, and name.</p>

<p>I am sick and tired of having to make a javascript function for each of them, because each input is a text input, and when a user clicks the input box I have it change the background of the input to a different color.</p>

<p>So heres how I coded:</p>

<p>The form inputs:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type=""text"" name=""username"" id=""usernameInput"" onclick=""changeUsername(); return false;"" onblur=""changeUsernameback(); return false;""&gt;

&lt;input type=""text"" name=""password"" id=""passwordInput"" onclick=""changePassword(); return false;"" onblur=""changePasswordback(); return false;""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and the other two forms are the same, only with different names and different id's and javascript functions.</p>

<p>MY Javascript:</p>

<pre><code>function changeUsername() {
 document.getElementById('usernameInput').style.background='#FFFF00';
}

function changeUsernameBack() {
 document.getElementById('passwordInput').style.background='#FFFF00';
}
</code></pre>

<p>and the other three are just like that only setup for their own specific id.</p>

<p>AND when creating CSS, I have to make different ID's for all 4 inputs.</p>

<p>What I want to know is: Is there a way I can only make one CSS id, and one javascript function to change all inputs? Because I know when you just use one function for all, javascript tries to change all at once.. </p>

<p>I was thinking something like</p>

<pre><code>document.getElementById('inputText'+[i]).style.background='#FFFF00';
</code></pre>

<p>and then when I give each input an id I could just automatically increment them on the page such as input1, input2, input3 etc.</p>

<p>But that doesn't seem to work? Maybe I am coding it wrong? Please help..</p>
","16417","","<p>You COULD do this:</p>

<pre><code>function change(el) {
    el.style.background='#FFFF00';
}

function changeBack(el) {
    el.style.background='#FFFF00';

<li>As far as I know, it is not necessary to <code>return false;</code> on either of these events.</li>
</ul>

<p><hr></p>

<p>While the above will work with plain Javascript, I am obligued to suggest the <a href=""http://www.jquery.com"" rel=""nofollow"">jQuery</a> way:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type=""text"" name=""username"" id=""usernameInput""&gt;

<blockquote>
  <p>By default, if no context is specified, $() looks for DOM elements within the context of the current HTML document. If you do specify a context, such as a DOM element or jQuery object, the expression will be matched against the contents of that context. </p>

<p>This way whenever you have new links that should be fancy boxes you don't have to give them unique IDs and come back to the javascript to make sure they are being initiliazed. You can have more than 1 class per element so it also won't affect existing classes. Most of the time when you have sets of something it is wise to use classes so you can treat them as such when manipulating them with jQuery.</p>

<blockquote>
  <h2>Projects vs. apps</h2>
  
  <p>What’s the difference between a project and an app? An app is a Web application that does something — e.g., a weblog system, a database of public records or a simple poll app. A project is a collection of configuration and apps for a particular Web site. A project can contain multiple apps. An app can be in multiple projects.</p>

<p>From <a href=""http://www.b-list.org/weblog/2006/sep/10/django-tips-laying-out-application/"">this link</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h2>Projects versus applications</h2>
  
  <p>This is really more of a separate (though related) question, but understanding the distinction Django draws between a “project” and an “application” is a big part of good code layout. Roughly speaking, this is what the two terms mean:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><p>An application tries to provide a single, relatively self-contained set of related functions. An application is allowed to define a set of models (though it doesn’t have to) and to define and register custom template tags and filters (though, again, it doesn’t have to).</p></li>
  <li><p>A project is a collection of applications, installed into the same database, and all using the same settings file. In a sense, the defining aspect of a project is that it supplies a settings file which specifies the database to use, the applications to install, and other bits of configuration. A project may correspond to a single web site, but doesn’t have to — multiple projects can run on the same site. The project is also responsible for the root URL configuration, though in most cases it’s useful to just have that consist of calls to include which pull in URL configurations from inidividual applications.</p></li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Views, custom manipulators, custom context processors and most other things Django lets you create can all be defined either at the level of the project or of the application, and where you do that should depend on what’s most effective for you; in general, though, they’re best placed inside an application (this increases their portability across projects). </p>

<ul>
<li>You were probably not wrapping your code around <code>document.ready</code>. This is important if your script is included at the top of the page, as anything you write that is not wrapped in this event will execute before the DOM elements are created. So you would be binding events to nothing. The <code>document.ready</code> event takes care of that by firing as soon as the DOM is fully loaded.</li>
<li>You had a missing closing <code>)</code> right before <code>.attr</code>. You should probably look into tools like <a href=""http://getfirebug.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">FireBug</a> to debug your javascript, as it is trivial to find these kind of things with it.</li>
<li>You were checking the value of the radio button, but it was always evaluating to true because you need to filter it out to only get the <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Selectors/checked"" rel=""nofollow""><code>:checked</code></a> one.</li>

","16417","","<p>You don't have to do <code>.each</code> - functions like <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Removeclass"" rel=""nofollow""><code>removeClass</code></a> can work on a set of elements just fine.</p>

"<p>Let's say I have some contrived models:</p>

<pre><code>class Author(Model):
   name = CharField()

class Book(Model):
   title = CharField()
   author = ForeignKey(Author)

<p>And let's say I want to use a ModelForm for Book:</p>

<pre><code>   class BookForm(ModelForm):
      class Meta:
         model = Book

<p>Simple so far.  But let's also say that I have a ton of Authors in my database, and I don't want to have such a long multiple choice field.  So, I'd like is to restrict the queryset on the BookForm's ModelMultipleChoiceField author field.  Let's also say that the queryset I want can't be chosen until <code>__init__</code>, because it relies on an argument to be passed.</p>

<p>This seems like it might do the trick:</p>

<pre><code>class BookForm(ModelForm):
   class Meta:
      model = Book

   def __init__(self, letter):
      # returns the queryset based on the letter
      choices = getChoices(letter)
      self.author.queryset = choices

<p>Of course, if that just worked I wouldn't be here.  That gets me an AttributeError.  'BookForm' object has no attribute 'author'.  So, I also tried something like this, where I try to override the ModelForm's default field and then set it later:</p>

<pre><code>class BookForm(ModelForm):
   author = ModelMultipleChoiceField(queryset=Author.objects.all())

No one seems to believe that some selectors do not work as expected. Look at this example:
On <a href=""http://dogself.com/telluriumTest/index2.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">this site</a> (which has jquery 1.3 on it for firebugging) there is a form that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form style=""display: inline;"" method=""get"" action=""list""&gt;

<p>(its around the 'search current downloads' dropdown). If you open firebug and try this selector: </p>

<pre><code>$(""form[action=list]"");
</code></pre>

<p>you will NOT be able to select the form. There is nothing special about the action attribute. Same goes for the src of the logo image on that page:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;img alt=""Logo"" src=""/p/aost/logo?logo_id=1238551994""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The selector which does not work is:</p>

<pre><code>$(""img[src=/p/aost/logo?logo_id=1238551994"");
</code></pre>

<p>Sure, i can do wildcard matches, that is not what i am after.</p>
","16417","","<p>There is no ""list"" of unsupported attributes because there shouldn't be; this is a bug in jQuery. </p>

<p>Here are the open tickets on this:</p>

<p>Apparently the common denominator between the bugs is that jQuery is comparing the selector string you specify against the full URL as opposed to the actual action/src attribute as it is defined in the HTML.

"<p>Lately I have been playing a game on my iPhone called Scramble. Some of you may know this game as Boggle. Essentially, when the game starts you get a matrix of letters like so:</p>

<pre><code>F X I E
A M L O
E W B X
A S T U
</code></pre>

<p>The goal of the game is to find as many words as you can that can be formed by chaining letters together. You can start with any letter, and all the letters that surround it are fair game, and then once you move on to the next letter, all the letters that surround that letter are fair game, <strong>except for any previously used letters</strong>. So in the grid above, for example, I could come up with the words <code>LOB</code>, <code>TUX</code>, <code>SEA</code>, <code>FAME</code>, etc. Words must be at least 3 characters, and no more than NxN characters, which would be 16 in this game but can vary in some implementations.  While this game is fun and addictive, I am apparently not very good at it and I wanted to cheat a little bit by making a program that would give me the best possible words (the longer the word the more points you get).</p>

<p><img src=""http://www.boggled.org/sample.gif"" alt=""Sample Boggle"" /></p>

<p>I am, unfortunately, not very good with algorithms or their efficiencies and so forth. My first attempt uses a dictionary <a href=""http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/src/share/dict/web2?rev=1.12;content-type=text%2Fplain"">such as this one</a> (~2.3MB) and does a linear search trying to match combinations with dictionary entries. This takes a <em>very</em> long time to find the possible words, and since you only get 2 minutes per round, it is simply not adequate.</p>

<p>I am interested to see if any Stackoverflowers can come up with more efficient solutions. I am mostly looking for solutions using the Big 3 Ps: Python, PHP, and Perl, although anything with Java or C++ is cool too, since speed is essential.</p>

<p>Here is a <a href=""http://www.rootspot.com/stackoverflow/boggle.php"">live link</a> if you want to try it out. Although it takes ~2s in my local machine, it takes ~5s on my webserver. In either case, it is not very fast.  Still, though, it is quite hideous so I can imagine the time can be reduced significantly. Any pointers on how to accomplish that would be appreciated. PHP's lack of tuples made the coordinates weird to work with and my inability to comprehend just what the hell is going on didn't help at all.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: A few fixes make it take less than 1s locally.</p>

"<p>Suppose I have the following HTML:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form id=""myform""&gt;
  &lt;input type='checkbox' name='foo[]'/&gt; Check 1&lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;input type='checkbox' name='foo[]' checked='true'/&gt; Check 2&lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;input type='checkbox' name='foo[]'/&gt; Check 3&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now, how do I select the checked input fields with name 'foo[]'?</p>

<p>This is my try, but it doesn't work:</p>

<pre><code>$('#myform input[name='foo']:checked:enabled');
</code></pre>
","16417","","<p>The name of the field isn't <code>foo</code>, it is <code>foo[]</code>. You could use the <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Selectors/attributeStartsWith#attributevalue"">attributeStartsWith</a> selector:</p>

<pre><code>$(""input[name^='foo']:checked:enabled"",'#myform');
</code></pre>

<p>Ideally, you'd be able to do this:</p>

<pre><code>$(""input[name='foo[]']:checked:enabled"",'#myform');
</code></pre>

<p>But as <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/739695/jquery-selector-value-escaping/740168#740168"">this answer</a> explains, jQuery uses this to parse the <code>value</code> part of the <code>attr=value</code> condition:</p>

<pre><code>(['""]*)(.*?)\3|)\s*\]
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>\3 being the group containing the opening quotes, which weirdly are allowed to be multiple opening quotes, or no opening quotes at all. The .*? then can parse any character, including quotes until it hits the first ‘]’ character, ending the match. There is no provision for backslash-escaping CSS special characters, so you can't match an arbitrary string value in jQuery.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, as soon as jQuery hits the first <code>]</code> it thinks the value is over. So you are stuck with startsWith or using pure DOM elements, as that answer also explains.</p>

<p><strong>SUPER DUPER IMPORTANT EDIT</strong>:<br />
This bug is fixed, apparently. You should be able to use the code I described as ""ideal"", above.</p>

"<p>I have been doing some reading up on jquery live event and am still kind of confused? What is the benefit to using it?</p>

<p><a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Events/live"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.jquery.com/Events/live</a></p>

<p>I know it is similar to bind but both of those events still seem off to me.</p>

<p>Just looking for some pointers.</p>
","16417","","<p>Sometimes you have a set of elements when the page loads, like, say, edit links:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Item 1&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=""#"" class=""edit""&gt;Edit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Item 2&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=""#"" class=""edit""&gt;Edit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Item 3&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=""#"" class=""edit""&gt;Edit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now, maybe you have something like this with jQuery:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function() {
  $('a.edit').click(function() {
    // do something
    return false;
  });
});
</code></pre>

<p>But what if you add a new element to this table dynamically, after the page has initially loaded?</p>

<pre><code>$('table').append('
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Item 4&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=""#"" class=""edit""&gt;Edit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
');
</code></pre>

<p>When you click on ""Edit"" on this new Item, nothing will happen because the events were bound on page load. Enter live. With it, you can bind the event above like this:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function() {
  $('a.edit').live('click', function() {
    // do something
    return false;
  });
});
</code></pre>

<p>Now if you add any new <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> elements with a class of <code>edit</code> after the page has initially loaded, it will still register this event handler.</p>

<p>But how is this accomplished?</p>

<p>jQuery uses what is known as event delegation to achieve this functionality. Event delegation is helpful in this situation or when you want to load a large amount of handlers. Say you have a DIV with images:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""container""&gt;
    &lt;img src=""happy.jpg""&gt;
    &lt;img src=""sad.jpg""&gt;
    &lt;img src=""laugh.jpg""&gt;
    &lt;img src=""boring.jpg""&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But instead of 4 images, you have 100, or 200, or 1000. You want to bind a click event to images so that X action is performed when the user clicks on it. Doing it as you might expect...</p>

<pre><code>$('#container img').click(function() {
    // do something
});
</code></pre>

<p>...would then bind hundreds of handlers that all do the same thing! This is inefficient and can result in slow performance in heavy webapps. With event delegation, even if you don't plan on adding more images later, using live can be much better for this kind of situation, as you can then bind <strong>one</strong> handler to the container and check when it is clicked if the target was an image, and then perform an action:</p>

<pre><code>// to achieve the effect without live...
$('#container').click(function(e) {
    if($(e.target).is('img')) {
        performAction(e.target);
    }
});

// or, with live:
$('img', '#container').live('click', function() {
    performAction(this);
});
</code></pre>

<p>Since jQuery knows that new elements can be added later on or that performance is important, instead of binding an event to the actual images, it might add one to the div like in the first example (in reality, I'm pretty sure it binds them to the body but it might to the container in the example above) and then delegate. This <code>e.target</code> property can let it check after the fact if the event that was clicked/acted on matches the selector that you might have specified.</p>

<p>To make it clear: this is helpful not only in the direct way of not having to rebind events, but it can be dramatically faster for a large amount of items.</p>

<p>PHP converts unknown literals to strings and throws a warning. Your php.ini probably had the error reporting level to not display warnings but someone may have updated it or something. In either case, it is bad practice to take advantange of PHP's behavior in this case.</p>

<p>For more information, check out <a href=""http://us.php.net/types.array"" rel=""nofollow"">the php documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Always use quotes around a string literal array index. For example, $foo['bar'] is correct, while $foo[bar] is not.</p>
  
  <p>This is wrong, but it works. The reason is that this code has an undefined constant (bar) rather than a string ('bar' - notice the quotes). PHP may in future define constants which, unfortunately for such code, have the same name. It works because PHP automatically converts a bare string (an unquoted string which does not correspond to any known symbol) into a string which contains the bare string. For instance, if there is no defined constant named bar, then PHP will substitute in the string 'bar' and use that. </p>

<pre><code>$('a', 'div.c2').text();
</code></pre>

<p>The reason <code>div.c2</code> is defined as the second argument is because it would then be the <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Core/jQuery#expressioncontext""><code>context</code></a> of the selector. By default jQuery searches the entire document when you use <code>$()</code>, by specifying <code>div.c2</code> it is only going to search inside of <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>'s with a class of c2.</p>

<p>Keeping this in mind, you could also rewrite the above like this:</p>

<pre><code>$('div.c2 a').text();
</code></pre>

<p>Most people prefer this because it is the syntax that you would use to select this element in a CSS stylesheet. However, jQuery then has to figure that out. You could  even do:</p>

<pre><code>$('div.c2').find('a').text();
</code></pre>

<p>However, I prefer the context method as I feel it is cleaner and marginally faster, not that it matters.</p>

<p>There is also the <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Html""><code>html()</code></a> property, which  gets the contents, <strong>including HTML</strong>.</p>

<p>So if your link was like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href='#'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hi There&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then:</p>

<pre><code>$('a').text(); // would return Hi There
$('a').html(); // would return &lt;b&gt;Hi There&lt;/b&gt;

"<p>I'm trying to use <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Ajax/jQuery.post"" rel=""nofollow"">jQuery.post()</a> function to retrieve some data. But 
i get no output.</p>

<p>I have a HTML that displays a table. Clicking this table should trigger a jQuery.post event.</p>

<p>My scriptfile looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>jQuery(document).ready(function() { 

  jQuery('#storeListTable tr').click(function() { 
    var storeID = this.cells[0].innerHTML; //This gets me the rowID for the DB call.

    jQuery.post(""../functions.php"", { storeID: ""storeID"" }, 
      function(data){ 
         alert(data.name); // To test if I get any output 
      }, ""json""); 
    }); 
});  
</code></pre>

<p>My PHP file looks like this: </p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php 
  inlcude_once('dal.php'); 

  //Get store data, and ouput it as JSON. 
  function getStoreInformation($storeID) 
  {
    $storeID = ""9"";//$_GET[""storeID""]; 
    $sl = new storeLocator(); 
    $result = $sl-&gt;getStoreData($storeID); 

    while ($row = mysql_fetch_assoc($result)) { 
    { 
        $arr[] = $row; 
    } 
    $storeData = json_encode($arr); 
    echo $storeData;  //Output JSON data 
  } 
?&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>I have tested the PHP file, and it outputs the data in JSON format. My only problem now is to return this data to my javascript.</p>

<ol>
<li>since the javascript is located in the /js/ folder, is it correct to call the php file by using '../'?</li>
<li>I don't think I'm passing the storeID parameter correctly. What is the right way?</li>
<li>How can I call the getStoreInformation($storeID) function and pass on the parameter? The jQuery example on jQuery.com has the following line:  $.post(""test.php"", { func: ""getNameAndTime"" }
Is the getNameAndTime the name of the function in test.php ?</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>I have gotten one step further.
I have moved the code from inside the function(), to outside. So now the php code is run when the file is executed.</p>

<p>My js script now looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>  jQuery('#storeListTable tr').click(function() {
    var storeID = this.cells[0].innerHTML;

    jQuery.post(""get_storeData.php"", { sID: storeID },
      function(data){
         alert(data);
      }, ""text"");
    });
</code></pre>

<p>This results in an alert window which ouputs the store data as string in JSON format.
(because I have changed ""json"" to ""text"").</p>

<p>The JSON string looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>[{""id"":""9"",""name"":""Brandstad Byporten"",""street1"":""Jernbanetorget"",""street2"":null,""zipcode"":""0154"",""city"":""Oslo"",""phone"":""23362011"",""fax"":""22178889"",""www"":""http:\/\/www.brandstad.no"",""email"":""bs.byporten@brandstad.no"",""opening_hours"":""Man-Fre 10-21, L"",""active"":""pending""}]
</code></pre>

<p>Now, what I really want, is to ouput the data from JSON.
So I would change ""text"" to ""json"" and ""alert(data)"" to ""alert(data.name)"".
So now my js script will look like this:</p>

<pre><code>  jQuery('#storeListTable tr').click(function() {
    var storeID = this.cells[0].innerHTML;

    jQuery.post(""get_storeData.php"", { sID: storeID },
      function(data){
         alert(data.name);
      }, ""json"");
    });
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately, the only output I get, is ""Undefined"".
And if I change ""alert(data.name);"" to ""alert(data);"", the output is ""[object Object]"".</p>

<ol>
<li><p>So how do I output the name of teh store?</p></li>
<li><p>In the PHP file, I've tried setting $storeID = $_GET[""sID""]; But I don't et the value. How can I get the value that is passed as paramter in jQuery.post ?
(currently I have hardcoded the storeID, for testing)</p></li>
</ol>
","16417","","<p><a href=""#755993"" rel=""nofollow"">bartclaeys</a> is correct. As it is right now, you are literally passing the string ""storeID"" as the store ID.</p>

<p>However, a couple more notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>It might seem weird that you will be setting <code>storeID: storeID</code> - why is only the second one being evaluated? When I first started I had to triple check everytime that I wasn't sending ""1:1"" or something. However, keys aren't evaluated when you are using object notation like that, so only the second one will be the actual variable value.</li>
<li>No, it is not correct that you are calling the PHP file as <code>../</code> thinking of the JS file's location. You have to call it in respect of whatever page has this javascript loaded. So if the page is actually in the same directory as the PHP file you are calling, you might want to fix that to point to the right place.</li>
<li>Kind of tied to the previous points, you <em>really</em> want to get your hands on <a href=""http://getfirebug.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Firebug</a>. This will allow you to see AJAX requests when they are sent, if they successfully make it, what data is being sent to them, and what data is being sent back. It is, put simply, the consensus tool of choice to debug your Javascript/AJAX application, and you should have it, use it, and cherish it if you don't want to waste another 6 days debugging a silly mistake. :)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> As far as your reply, if you break down what you are returning:</p>

<pre><code>[
  {
    ""id"":""9"",
    ""name"":""Brandstad Byporten"",
    ""street1"":""Jernbanetorget"",
    ""street2"":null,

    ""opening_hours"":""Man-Fre 10-21, L"",
    ""active"":""pending""
  }
]
</code></pre>

<p>This is actually an array (the square brackets) containing a single object (the curly braces).</p>

<p>So when you try doing:</p>

<pre><code>alert(data.name);
</code></pre>

<p>This is not correct because the object resides as the first element of the array.</p>

<pre><code>alert(data[0].name);
</code></pre>

<p>Should work as you expect.</p>

","16417","","<p>You can't/shouldn't have <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> elements without a parent <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>.

<p>Please let me know.</p>
","16417","","<p>Mmm. Tough one. :) This should do it, though:</p>

<pre><code>$(function() {
    $(""tr[id^='parent_']"").each(function() {
        var count = 0;
        $(this).nextAll('tr').each(function() {
            if($(this).hasClass('child')) {
                count++;
            } else {
                return false;
            }
        });
        $(this).find('td').append(' (' + count + ')');
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p><a href=""http://jsbin.com/izeze"" rel=""nofollow"">Tested and works</a>.</p>

<p><hr></p>

<p>Although the above works, it is not very efficient. I also want to take a second to suggest you change the format of your HTML a little bit. You want to make your code be as semantically relevant to the content it holds as possible. Having one huge table mixing parents and childs is not the optimal way of achieving this. I am not sure what your use case is here, but consider doing something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li id=""parent_1""&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;Parent 1&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Children 1&lt;/li&gt; 
      &lt;li&gt;Children 2&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Children 3&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li id=""parent_2""&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;Parent 2&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Children 1&lt;/li&gt; 
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li id=""parent_3""&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;Parent 3&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Children 1&lt;/li&gt; 
      &lt;li&gt;Children 2&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You could still style this however you want to give it the appearance you want, although it may not be as easy if you really are displaying tabular data about the parents and children.</p>

<p>With that code, however, you could then simplify the above with a much more efficient:</p>

<pre><code>$('ul &gt; li').each(function() {
    var count = $(this).find('li').length;
    $('span', this).append(' (' + count + ')');
});
</code></pre>

<p>If changing the code from a table to a list is not possible/desired, but you have access to the server-side code that presumably generates this table, you could at least make things easier then by giving all the children a class with the ID of the parent, and giving all the parents a common class:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;table&gt;
    &lt;tr id=""parent_1"" class=""parent""&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Parent 1&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr class=""child parent-1""&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Child 1&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr class=""child parent-1""&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Child 2&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr id=""parent_2"" class=""parent""&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Parent2&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr class=""child parent-2""&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Child 1&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr id=""parent_3"" class=""parent""&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Parent3&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr class=""child parent-3""&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Child 1&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr class=""child parent-3""&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Child 2&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr class=""child parent-3""&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Child 3&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Which would then allow you to do this, much faster than the original solution:</p>

<pre><code>$('tr.parent').each(function() {
    var id = $(this).attr('id').split('_').pop();
    var count = $('tr.parent-' + id).length;
    $(this).find('td').append(' (' + count + ')');
});

</code></pre>

<p>is it possible to make it like running live??</p>
","16417","","<p>Here's how to do it. <a href=""http://www.rootspot.com/stackoverflow/timer.php""><strong>Working Demo</strong></a>.</p>

<p>First, at the top of your HTML document:</p>

<pre><code>.datetime {
    color: #C11B17;
    font-family:arial;
    font-size: 16px;
}
</code></pre>

<p>We do this so we can clean up our HTML code a little bit:</p>

<pre><code>$rdate1 = 1240550032; // Fri, 24 Apr 2009 05:13:52 GMT
$expiredate = date('d m Y G:i:s', $rdate1);
$time = $rdate1 - time();
$days = floor($time/86400);
$hours = floor(($time-($days*86400))/3600);
$mins = floor(($time-($days*86400)-($hours*3600))/60);
$secs = floor($time-($days*86400)-($hours*3600)-($mins*60));

printf(""
    Your account is going to expire in
    &lt;span class='datetime' id='days'&gt;%s&lt;/span&gt; Days
    &lt;span class='datetime' id='hours'&gt;%s&lt;/span&gt; Hours
    &lt;span class='datetime' id='minutes'&gt;%s&lt;/span&gt; Minutes
    &lt;span class='datetime' id='seconds'&gt;%s&lt;/span&gt; Seconds
"", $days, $hours, $mins, $secs);
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not quite sure where that middle step you were taking for came from, but the code above gets me the difference in time between <code>$rdate1</code> (presumably a unix timestamp) and <code>time()</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, we can do something like this with Javascript to update the time once the page loads:</p>

<pre><code>addEvent(window, 'load', function() {
    var eDays = document.getElementById('days');
    var eHours = document.getElementById('hours');
    var eMinutes = document.getElementById('minutes');
    var eSeconds = document.getElementById('seconds');
    var timer;
    timer = setInterval(function() {
        var vDays = parseInt(eDays.innerHTML, 10);
        var vHours = parseInt(eHours.innerHTML, 10);
        var vMinutes = parseInt(eMinutes.innerHTML, 10);
        var vSeconds = parseInt(eSeconds.innerHTML, 10);

        vSeconds--;
        if(vSeconds &lt; 0) {
            vSeconds = 59;
            vMinutes--;

                vMinutes = 59;
                vHours--;
                if(vHours &lt; 0) {
                    vHours = 23;
                    vDays--;
                }
            }
        } else {
            if(vSeconds == 0 &amp;&amp;
               vMinutes == 0 &amp;&amp;
               vHours == 0 &amp;&amp;
               vDays == 0) {
                clearInterval(timer);
            }
        }
        eSeconds.innerHTML = vSeconds;
        eMinutes.innerHTML = vMinutes;
        eHours.innerHTML = vHours;
        eDays.innerHTML = vDays;
    }, 1000);
});


function addEvent( obj, type, fn ) {
  if ( obj.attachEvent ) {
    obj['e'+type+fn] = fn;

However, since the terminology used is disjoint (lk's <em>""object has an attribute""</em> vs my <em>""module has a function""</em>) it may be helpful to preserve this question for searchability unless the two can be combined.</p>
","16417","","<p><a href=""http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#hasattr""><code>hasattr()</code></a> is the best choice. Go with that. :)</p>

One of the answers there discusses the merits of the two options you have: catching the exception (""easier to ask for forgiveness than permission"") or simply checking before hand (""look before you leap""). Honestly, I am more of the latter, but it seems like the Python community leans towards the former school of thought.</p>

"<p>I'm looking for good exif (Exchangeable image file format) manipulation library for python. I prefer flexibility (e.g., ability to retrieve providers' proprietary tags) than processing speed. What would you suggest? </p>

  <p>The Python Imaging Library (PIL) adds image processing capabilities to your Python interpreter. This library supports many file formats, and provides powerful image processing and graphics capabilities.</p>

They recommend if theirs isn't doing the trick to check out EXIF-py, so you should probably try that one first, as their sourceforge page seems to have <em>some</em> activity there lately, though not much.

</code></pre>

<p>If the div can have HTML tags in it, you're going to have to traverse its children looking for text nodes:</p>

<pre><code>function get_text(el) {
    ret = """";
    var length = el.childNodes.length;
    for(var i = 0; i &lt; length; i++) {

<p>This is the same logic that the jQuery library uses to achieve the effect of its <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Attributes/text""><code>text()</code></a> function. jQuery is a pretty awesome library that in this case is not necessary. However, if you find yourself doing a lot of DOM manipulation or AJAX then you might want to check it out.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:</p>

<p>As noted by Gumbo in the comments, the way we are splitting the strings above would count two consecutive spaces as a word. If you expect that sort of thing (and even if you don't) it's probably best to avoid it by splitting on a regular expression instead of on a simple space character. Keeping that in mind, instead of doing the above split, you should do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>var count = words.split(/\s+/).length;

"<p>I'm just getting going with jQuery and am pretty excited about it. </p>

<p>My reason for posting is that I've written some jQuery that does it's required task, but I'm suspecting that it lacks a little in elegance...</p>

<p>I'm trying to grab all table rows that have:
1) a class of 'item'
2) a child text input box that has a value</p>

<h2>The HTML:</h2>

<pre><code>&lt;tr class=""item""&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;

<pre><code>...
var selections=$("".item&gt;.quantity&gt;:text[value!='']"").parent().parent();
...

<p>The code I posted above works, but there are two things (at least?) that smell a little funny.</p>

<p>Code smell #1:
I'm using '.parent().parent()' at the end to grab the whole row. Is there some way that I can just say, ""give me all tr's with a class of 'item' where the child text input has a value"" instead of backtraking up the heirarchy at the end?</p>

<p>Code smell #2:
I can't figure out a way to 'trim' the text input's value during the selection to ensure that whitespace isnt interpreted as content. With my current method, I would have to 'trim' and check again during the .each loop, which seems redundant.</p>

<p>Let me know if you see a 'better way'?</p>

<p>For example, requesting <code>http://www.arstechnica.com</code> takes about two minutes. I've tried the same request using another web site that does the same basic task, and it comes back immediately. So there must be something I have set incorrectly that's causing this delay.</p>

<p>Here's the code I have:</p>

<pre><code>$ch = curl_init();
curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1);
curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_URL, $url);
curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT, 20);
curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_USERAGENT, $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT']);

// Only calling the head
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HEADER, true); // header will be at output
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_CUSTOMREQUEST, 'HEAD'); // HTTP request is 'HEAD'

$content = curl_exec ($ch);
curl_close ($ch);
</code></pre>

<p>Here's a link to the web site that does the same function: <a href=""http://www.seoconsultants.com/tools/headers.asp"">http://www.seoconsultants.com/tools/headers.asp</a></p>

<p>The code above, at least on my server, takes two minutes to retrieve www.arstechnica.com, but the service at the link above returns it right away.</p>

<p>What am I missing?</p>
","16417","","<p>Try simplifying it a little bit:</p>

<pre><code>print htmlentities(file_get_contents(""http://www.arstechnica.com""));
</code></pre>

<p>The above outputs instantly on my webserver. If it doesn't on yours, there's a good chance your web host has some kind of setting in place to throttle these kind of requests.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:</p>

<p>Since the above happens instantly for you, try setting <a href=""http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.curl-setopt.php"">this curl setting</a> on your original code:</p>

<pre><code>curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION, true);
</code></pre>

<p>Using the tool you posted, I noticed that <code>http://www.arstechnica.com</code> has a 301 header sent for any request sent to it. It is possible that cURL is getting this and not following the new Location specified to it, thus causing your script to hang.</p>

<p><strong>SECOND EDIT</strong>:</p>

<p>Curiously enough, trying the same code you have above was making my webserver hang too. I replaced this code:</p>

<pre><code>curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_CUSTOMREQUEST, 'HEAD'); // HTTP request is 'HEAD'
</code></pre>

<p>With this:</p>

<pre><code>curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_NOBODY, true);
</code></pre>

<p>Which is the way <a href=""http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.curl-setopt.php"">the manual</a> recommends you do a HEAD request. It made it work instantly.</p>

"<p>I would like to give users access to delete a model instance that they added to the db. In the django docs it says allowing someone to delete from the template is not a good practice. Is there a secure way to let a user click a ""delete this"" link from the template and remove that model instance? How should I go about doing that?</p>
","16417","","<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/679013/get-vs-post-best-practices/679042"">Check out this question</a> for discussion related to what you are asking about.</p>

<p>Essentially, when you normally click on a link on the page the browser makes a <code>GET</code> request to the server to get the next page's contents. Just like there is a lot of pushing towards semantically relevant CSS layouts, it is also important that your page requests are semantically relevant. The problem with using links to remove items is that it is making a <code>GET</code> request to <code>DELETE</code> something in the database. From this comes the problem that some search engines might index your links and accidentally erase content. There also comes the problem of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site%5Frequest%5Fforgery"" rel=""nofollow"">cross-site request forgeries</a> which can make an unsuspecting user make a command to a website without being aware. So the proper way to handle this is by following the rule that <strong>any request that modifies state in the server should be processed via POST</strong>. As such, instead of doing this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href=""{% url remove_item item.id %}""&gt;Delete Item&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>It is better to do this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form action='{% url remove_item %}' method='POST' id='form'&gt;
    &lt;input type='hidden' name='action' value='delete'&gt;
    &lt;input type='hidden' name='id' value='{{ item.id }}'&gt;
    &lt;input type=""submit"" value=""Delete Item""&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If you would like to keep your links while maintaining the <code>POST</code>, you'd have to resort to Javascript:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href=""#"" onclick=""document.getElementById('form').submit(); return false;""&gt;Delete Item&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Unsightly, yes, but it's for the best. Your Django view would then do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>def remove_item(request):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        ## remove item
</code></pre>

<p>Furthermore, as Scott mentions, Django has some built in stuff to help you avoid the cross-site request forgeries I mentioned above, since it is still possible to do it even if you are doing a POST (just slightly harder). The way to avoid this is to have some kind of token tied to the form that needs to be validated server side before allowing the action to be taken. Check out the <a href=""http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.0/ref/contrib/csrf/#module-django.contrib.csrf"" rel=""nofollow"">CsrfMiddleware</a> class for more details on that. It will essentially automate some of that work out of it for you.</p>

"<p>i am a newbie and try different things everyday and always come here when i am stuck with something.</p>

and after we select country say 'india' url is:<a href=""http://tools.cisco.com/WWChannels/LOCATR/performBasicSearch.do"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tools.cisco.com/WWChannels/LOCATR/performBasicSearch.do</a> , there is no reference to any country selected.</p>

<p>The Idea that i had was to traverse the HTML page, and enter all countries in an array and then make a recursive function to call a page with specific country but for that we need something different in URL for each country in recursive function right?</p>

<p>Please help </p>
","16417","","<p>Your url is messed up, so I can't see the exact page you are talking about, however what is <em>most likely</em> happening is that when you change the country the website is making a <code>POST</code> request to the same page
 with a variable like <code>country</code> (although it may be something else) with the value of the country name/country id that you selected. If you View Source on the page you will be able to see the input field's name that is being passed on. Once you do that, while making your cURL request you can set the <a href=""http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.curl-setopt.php"" rel=""nofollow"">cuRL option</a> of <code>CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS</code>, which reads like so:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The full data to post in a HTTP ""POST"" operation. To post a file, prepend a filename with @ and use the full path. This can either be passed as a urlencoded string like 'para1=val1&amp;para2=val2&amp;...' or as an array with the field name as key and field data as value. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, keeping that in mind you would do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ch = curl_init('http://tools.cisco.com/WWChannels/LO...BasicSearch.do');
$ch = curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, array('country' =&gt; 'India'));
$ch = curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
$contents = curl_exec($ch);
curl_close($ch);

","16417","","<p>This is happening because the plugin binds the event handlers on page load, and you are then adding dynamic content to the page after the fact. The easiest solution would be to move whatever code you have to instatiate the DomWindow plugin into a function and call it once on page load and again whenever a new link is added. If it starts double binding the already existing links, you'd then have to give the dynamic links a different class and instatiate the second time around for that class.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:</p>

<p>There seems to be some misunderstanding here, so I'll explain further:</p>

<p>The jQuery <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Events/live#typefn"" rel=""nofollow""><code>live</code></a> feature (which you are using for <code>.deleteThis</code>) was designed to fix the problem that you are having. You probably already know this and hence you are using it. The above paragraph was because I believe what you are saying is that the DomWindow <code>edit</code> link you are returning is not opening the DomWindow as you might expect. This is because DomWindow does not use <code>live</code> internally to bind the events. So when you initially instatiate DomWindow on page load, the links get bound, but the new ones don't. If you're willing to edit the source code of the plugin you could directly fix this by simply using <code>live</code>, but it is easier (although not as ""clean"") to just move the code to a function and call it whenever you're adding more content to the page.</p>

"<p>Since PHP's <a href=""http://php.net/call_user_method""><code>call_user_method()</code></a> and <a href=""http://php.net/manual/function.call-user-method-array.php""><code>call_user_method_array()</code></a> are marked deprecated I'm wondering what alternative is recommended?</p>

<p>One way would be to use <a href=""http://php.net/manual/function.call-user-func.php""><code>call_user_func()</code></a>, because by giving an array with an object and a method name as the first argument does the same like the deprecated functions. Since this function is not marked deprecated I assume the reason isn't the non-OOP-stylish usage of them?</p>

<p>The other way I can think of is using the <a href=""http://php.net/manual/language.oop5.reflection.php"">Reflection API</a>, which might be the most comfortable and future-oriented alternative. Nevertheless it's more code and I could image that it's slower than using the functions mentioned above.</p>

<p>What I'm interested in:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is there a completely new technique for calling an object's methods by name?</li>
<li>Which is the fastest/best/official replacement?</li>
<li>What's the reason for deprecation?</li>

","16417","","<p>As you said <a href=""http://www.php.net/call%5Fuser%5Ffunc""><code>call_user_func</code></a> can easily duplicate the behavior of this function. What's the problem?</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://us.php.net/call%5Fuser%5Fmethod""><code>call_user_method</code></a> page even lists it as the alternative:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
call_user_func(array($obj, $method_name), $parameter /* , ... */);
call_user_func(array(&amp;$obj, $method_name), $parameter /* , ... */); // PHP 4
?&gt;

<p>As far as to <em>why</em> this was deprecated, <a href=""http://www.mail-archive.com/php-dev@lists.php.net/msg11576.html"">this posting explains it:</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is 
  because the <code>call_user_method()</code> and <code>call_user_method_array()</code> functions 
  can easily be duplicated by:</p>
  
  <p>old way:<br />
  <code>call_user_method($func, $obj, ""method"", ""args"", ""go"", ""here"");</code></p>
  
  <p>new way:<br />
  <code>call_user_func(array(&amp;$obj, ""method""), ""method"", ""args"", ""go"", ""here"");</code></p>

"<p>Is there a way in JavaScript to compare values from one array and see if it is in another array? </p>

<p>Similar to PHP's <a href=""http://www.php.net/in_array""><code>in_array</code></a> function?</p>
","16417","","<p>No, it doesn't have one. For this reason most popular libraries come with one in their utility packages. Check out jQuery's <em><a href=""http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.inArray/"">inArray</a></em> and Prototype's <em><a href=""http://www.prototypejs.org/api/array/indexof"">Array.indexOf</a></em> for examples. </p>

<p>jQuery's implementation of it is as simple as you might expect:</p>

<pre><code>function inArray(needle, haystack) {
    var length = haystack.length;
    for(var i = 0; i &lt; length; i++) {
        if(haystack[i] == needle) return true;
    }
    return false;
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you are dealing with a sane amount of array elements the above will do the trick nicely.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Whoops. I didn't even notice you wanted to see if an array was inside another. According to the PHP documentation this is the expected behavior of PHP's <a href=""http://www.php.net/in_array""><code>in_array</code></a>:</p>

<pre><code>$a = array(array('p', 'h'), array('p', 'r'), 'o');

if (in_array(array('p', 'h'), $a)) {
    echo ""'ph' was found\n"";
}

if (in_array(array('f', 'i'), $a)) {
    echo ""'fi' was found\n"";
}

if (in_array('o', $a)) {
    echo ""'o' was found\n"";
}

// Output:
//  'ph' was found
//  'o' was found
</code></pre>

<p>The code posted by Chris and Alex does not follow this behavior. Alex's is the official version of Prototype's indexOf, and Chris's is more like PHP's <a href=""http://www.php.net/array_intersect""><code>array_intersect</code></a>. This does what you want:</p>

<pre><code>function arrayCompare(a1, a2) {
    if (a1.length != a2.length) return false;
    var length = a2.length;
    for (var i = 0; i &lt; length; i++) {
        if (a1[i] !== a2[i]) return false;
    }
    return true;
}

function inArray(needle, haystack) {
    var length = haystack.length;
    for(var i = 0; i &lt; length; i++) {
        if(typeof haystack[i] == 'object') {
            if(arrayCompare(haystack[i], needle)) return true;
        } else {
            if(haystack[i] == needle) return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
</code></pre>

<p>And this my test of the above on it:</p>

<pre><code>var a = [['p','h'],['p','r'],'o'];
if(inArray(['p','h'], a)) {
    alert('ph was found');
}
if(inArray(['f','i'], a)) {
    alert('fi was found');
}
if(inArray('o', a)) {
    alert('o was found');
}  
// Results:
//   alerts 'ph' was found
//   alerts 'o' was found
</code></pre>

<p>Note that I intentionally did not extend the Array prototype as it is generally a bad idea to do so.</p>

<p>Problem with the existing code is it's not adding the selected class unless you hover directly over the edit link. Like I mentioned above I need it to add the selected class when you mouse over anywhere in the that row. I also only want it to display the edit link for that specific row.</p>

<p>Any help would be really appreciated been pulling my hair out for a couple hours and I know it is probably something stupid. Thanks!</p>
","16417","","<p>A few things:</p>

<ul>
<li>The string that you pass to the magical <code>$()</code> jQuery function can be the equivalent of what you may put in a CSS stylesheet if you wanted to style a particular element. The way you are using the selectors right now is wildly inefficient in addition to not being very clear. For example, using the <code>=*</code> selector is trying to find all links with the string <code>edit</code> <em>anywhere</em> in the class attribute. So links with a class of <code>abceditabc</code> would match. This makes jQuery do much more work than necessary trying to find these non-existent links. The accepted usage is instead to use a selector string such as <code>a.edit</code> which jQuery can quickly determine what it is and how to get it.</li>
<li>Whenever you do an event binding like you are doing, <code>this</code> refers to the element that the event is currently being acted on inside the function. Unless you are doing event delegation, you're not really going to use <code>e.target</code>.</li>
<li>The reason your code is only working when the hover is directly over the link is because whenever you hover over a different cell  <code>e.target</code> would be a sibling td. <code>closest</code> does not have the ability to then traverse up that td, to the tr, to the next td down to the link. And even if it did, you probably want to avoid this as it's not necessary. This ties to the second point, as it is much easier to simply look for the link coming down from the table row.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, keeping these things in mind, you can rewrite what you have to this:</p>

<pre><code>$(function() {
    $('a.edit').hide(); // hide all links with a class of edit
    // act upon all table rows with a class of data
    $('tr.data').hover(function() {
        // at this point, 'this' is the table row that is being hovered
        // we can use the find function to locate the link with a class of edit
        // then add a class to it and show it.
        $(this).find('a.edit').addClass(""selected"").show();
    }, function() {
        // the second argument of the hover function is what should happen
        // when the mouse hovers out of the table row. In this case, we want
        // to find the link again, remove the class, and hide it.
        $(this).find('a.edit').removeClass(""selected"").hide();
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>You can see the code this code acting on the HTML you posted <a href=""http://jsbin.com/iguro"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>. Works for me on FF, IE.</p>

<p>A couple further suggestions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Always have the <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Main%5FPage"" rel=""nofollow"">jQuery documentation</a> open. It is very good at explaining how things work.</li>
<li>Get used to using Firefox/<a href=""http://getfirebug.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Firebug</a> when debugging your jQuery. Using <code>console.log(this);</code> inside your selectors when you want to see exactly what is being selected is a functionality that cannot be understated.</li>

"<p>I'd like to provide a functionality for users of my website to get assigned an email address upon registration (such as firstname.lastname@mydomain.com) but I don't really think it is feasible to actually support all these emails account normally through a webmail program. I am also not sure if my webhost would be cool with it. What I'd really want is to be able to have a seamless integration of this email into the bigger system that the website is, as it is mostly going to be for intra-site messaging but we want to allow users to put actual email addresses. So what I would like to do instead is have a catch-all account under mydomain and have this email look at incoming mail, see who it was meant to be sent to, and add a message for the user in the system.</p>

<p>1) Is this the right approach? How expensive would it be to get a host that would allow me to just assign emails to at will to my domain? I am currently using WebFaction's shared hosting.<br />
2) If it is an okay approach, what is the best way to route this catch all account to my python script? I have read about .forward but I am not very good at UNIX stuff.

<p>just like that I used to have in the php a echo array2json statement but it just gave back gibberish...I really don't know what am I doing wrong and I've googled for about 3 hours just getting basically the same stuff. Also I don't know how to pass parameters to the ""data:"" in the $.ajax function in another way like getting info from the web page, can anyone please help me?</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>I did what you suggested and it prints the data now thank you very much =) however, I was wondering, how can I send the data to the ""data:"" part in jQuery so it takes it from let's say user input, also I was checking the php documentation and it says I'm allowed to write something like:</p>

<pre><code>json_encode($a,JSON_HEX_TAG|JSON_HEX_APOS|JSON_HEX_QUOT|JSON_HEX_AMP)
</code></pre>

<p>however, if I do that I get an error saying that json_encode accepts 1 parameter and I'm giving 2...any idea why? I'm using php 5.2</p>
","16417","","<p>First: the data you are passing to the PHP script will be in <code>$_POST</code>, not in <code>$_POST['data']</code>.</p>

<p>Next: you need to actually call the <code>array2json</code> function with some data... Is that the full code sample?</p>

<p>Also, I'm not sure what <code>array2json</code> is supposed to do... why not call <code>json_encode</code> directly?</p>

<p>For your example you can simply make your PHP file look like this:</p>

<pre><code>print json_encode($_POST);
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, you should get a tool like <a href=""http://getfirebug.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Firebug</a> to easily debug your AJAX calls.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:</p>

<p>In order to send data from the user, all you have to do is have a <a href=""http://www.w3schools.com/html/html%5Fforms.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">form</a> anywhere in your page, then catch the <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Events/submit#fn"" rel=""nofollow"">submit</a> event of it and <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Ajax/serialize"" rel=""nofollow"">serialize</a> the  data, or simply <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Attributes/val"" rel=""nofollow"">get the value</a> of an individual input field. Then you can just construct your data query with it, as a string or an object. There is also the very popular <a href=""http://malsup.com/jquery/form/"" rel=""nofollow"">Form plugin</a> for jQuery that makes it all easier.</p>

<p>The reason you are getting an error is because the 2nd argument of <a href=""http://www.php.net/json%5Fencode"" rel=""nofollow""><code>json_encode</code></a> was not added until PHP 5.3.0. So if you have anything earlier than that it's not available to you.</p>

"<p>I am working on a project has me constantly pinging a php script for new data, so if I understand this correctly that means that the php script being pinged gets run over and over indefinitely. It works but i'm guessing its a huge strain on the server, and is probably considered ugly and bad practice. Am I right about that?</p>

<p>Is there any way I could keep the connection to the script alive and make use of php's built in output buffering to flush the contents I need, but keep the script running for infinity using some sort of loop so when new data is available it can be output. Is this a bad idea as well?</p>

It is mostly popular for the inverse of what you want - the server pushing information to a page continuously - but it can obviously work both ways. Although your mileage may vary, I've heard good things. As Wikipedia describes it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In web development, Comet is a neologism to describe a web application model in which a long-held HTTP request allows a web server to push data to a browser, without the browser explicitly requesting it. Comet is an umbrella term for multiple techniques for achieving this interaction. All these methods rely on features included by default in browsers, such as Javascript, rather than on non-default plugins.</p>

"<p><strong>Background</strong>
I have two select form fields chained together: duration and frequency. When the user selects a frequency, the duration options are dynamically inserted. There are default options, but those are just so that the field isn't empty when the user expands it. </p>

<p>For example, the frequency options are ""day"", ""other day"", and ""week"". If I select ""day"", the frequency options change to ""5 days"", ""15 days"", and ""30 days"".</p>

<p><strong>Problem</strong>
The problem comes when the user submits the form with errors, the form is returned with all the form fields re-populated and the errors highlighted -- except for the Frequency select field -- whose options are dynamically generated. It is not highlighted and it's options are the default options. </p>

<p>Is there a way that I can have these options re-populated if the user submits with an error. We are doing quite a bit of JavaScript validation, so this situation shouldn't happen that often, but would like to make getting an error as painless an experience as possible for the users.</p>

<p><strong>Code</strong>
I'm using jquery and a jquery plugin called cascade to chain the two fields together. 
(<a href=""http://plugins.jquery.com/project/cascade"" rel=""nofollow"">http://plugins.jquery.com/project/cascade</a>)</p>

<p>Here's my custom JavaScript.</p>

<p>This script generates the list of options:</p>

<pre><code>var list1 = [
    {'When':'86400','Value':' ','Text':' '},
    {'When':'172800','Value':' ','Text':' '},
    {'When':'604800','Value':' ','Text':' '},
    {'When':'86400','Value':'432000','Text':'5 days'},
    {'When':'86400','Value':'1296000','Text':'15 days'},
    {'When':'86400','Value':'2505600','Text':'30 days'},
    {'When':'172800','Value':'1296000','Text':'15 days'},
    {'When':'172800','Value':'2505600','Text':'30 days'},
    {'When':'172800','Value':'3888000','Text':'45 days'},
    {'When':'604800','Value':'2505600','Text':'4 weeks'},
    {'When':'604800','Value':'3715200','Text':'6 weeks'},
    {'When':'604800','Value':'4924800','Text':'8 weeks'}
];

function commonTemplate(item) {
    return ""&lt;option value='"" + item.Value + ""'&gt;"" + item.Text + ""&lt;/option&gt;""; 
};

function commonMatch(selectedValue) {
    return this.When == selectedValue; 
};
</code></pre>

<p>And this is the script that triggers the generation of the select options:</p>

<pre><code>jQuery(""#duration).cascade(""#frequency"",{
    list: list1,    		
    template: commonTemplate,
    match: commonMatch  		
})
</code></pre>

<p><strong>The Question</strong>
Any thoughts on how to get the dynamically generated frequency options to re-populate when the form is returned to the browser with errors? Could either use the cascade plugin I'm currently using or some other method? </p>

<p>Help is muchly appreciated. :-)</p>
","16417","","<p>I am not familiar with this plugin, but couldn't you just fire the <code>change()</code> event of <code>#duration</code> and/or <code>#frequency</code> on document.ready?</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function() {
    $('#duration').change();
    $('#frequency').change();
});
</code></pre>

<p>I am pretty sure all the script is doing is binding stuff to the change event of the select (by default, at least) so that should trigger the plugin to work its magic...</p>

"<p>You're  creating an HTML layout. Let's assume that you don't need the benefits of multiple stylesheets, that a small increase in HTML size is not a concern, and that you have a style which will only be used once. I'm often in favour of using an inline style here, as I view the repetition of your CSS class name or ID as the cost of an abstraction you don't currently need, and may not ever use.</p>

<p>Standard doctrine these days is to always create HTML layouts using semantic markup and CSS styles, so am I missing something here? Please let me know your thoughts.</p>
","16417","","<p>There are some situations in which I usually neglect creating a new class for a simple style change on a single element. It is usually pretty clear when you are doing it that there's a low-to-zero chance of you needing to apply that particular style to something else later down the road. The most common case for me is when I need something to have a particular padding/margin to be in the right place but it's not an element important enough to have its own ID.</p>

<p>This may not be a popular opinion here, but in those scenarios I don't think an inline style is evil.</p>

","16417","","<p>You have to add <code>return false;</code> at the bottom of your click function to prevent the default link event action from happening. The default link event in this case would be going to the top of the page because the href of <code>#</code> tells the browser to go to the top. So it would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>$('#addcomment').click(function() {
    $('#divComments').slideDown(2000);

"<p>This is my first time on StackOverflow though I ""read"" Coding Horror quite often. Anyway...</p>

<p>I'm working on a school/college project using CakePHP and I'm using the built in AuthComponent to support user Authentication (i.e. logging in, etc). </p>

","16417","","<p>I haven't used CakePHP since version 1.1, so I am not sure if this has changed, but you may want to check out your <code>DEBUG</code> level.

","16417","","<p>It is common practice when dealing with sets of elements and CSS/Javascript to give them all a similar class if at all possible to make them easier to work with. You could then just do this:</p>

<pre><code>$('.mysimilarclass li:first-child').addClass('first-child');
</code></pre>

<p>If that's not an option, you could also just aggregate all the selectors into one:</p>

<pre><code>$('#tabs, .photos, #alphabet').find('li:first-child').addClass('first-child');
</code></pre>

<p>For the second set the same thing applies. You can ""group"" them all with one class, or just aggregate all the selectors you want and then only find images from them. Plus, you can take advantange of jQuery's chaining to not query the DOM more than once:</p>

<pre><code>$(function(){
    $(""#header-thumbs, .catalog dt, .photos li"")
     .find(""img"")
     .fadeTo(""fast"", 1)
     .hover(function() {
         $(this).fadeTo(""fast"", .7);
     }, function() {
         $(this).fadeTo(""fast"", 1);
     });
});
</code></pre>

<p>Also, if at all possible, it is good practice to always add what element is expected to have a class in your selectors. So instead of <code>.photos li</code> it is better to do <code>ul.photos li</code> or whatever element will have a class of <code>photos</code>. This is not always possible, of course, but it is advisable whenever it is.</p>

<p>You <em>could</em> insert the link yourself with Javascript, but then it'd be for naught as far as PageRank goes.
You <em>could</em> give them the HTML with the link having an ID like <code>mycompanybacklink</code> and check with Javascript whether the element exists or not. If it doesn't, don't display the badge or whatever. If it does, you can verify that the link's href is your website and its text is what you want. You would have to edit the HTML you posted as sample so that the link comes before the script, not after. The element could still exist, however, but be blocked by some other element or simply hidden with CSS. You could then also do something akin to what jQuery does now with its <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Selectors/hidden"" rel=""nofollow"">:hidden</a> selector: Instead of looking at the CSS property by itself (which is what a webmaster is most likely to try) you can just see whether the element itself or its parents take up any space in the document.

","16417","","<p>There are different type of error levels. Checking a variable that is not set only throws a notice. Your <a href=""http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.error-reporting.php"">error reporting</a> is probably set to ignore those. It is best practice to always use <code>isset</code> when you want to check if a variable has been set, although <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/413929/weak-typing-in-php-why-use-isset-at-all"">it does have its gotchas</a>.</p>

<p>Doing only what you are doing above, for example, if <code>$_REQUEST[""input_name""]</code> is the string ""0"", it will evaluate to false.

"<p>So what I'm trying to do is replace a string ""keyword"" with 
    <code>""&lt;b&gt;keyword&lt;/b&gt;""</code>
in a larger string.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>myString = ""HI there. You should higher that person for the job. Hi hi.""</p>

<p>keyword = ""hi""</p>

<p>result I would  want would be:</p>

<p><code>result = ""&lt;b&gt;HI&lt;/b&gt; there. You should higher that person for the job. </code>
<code>&lt;b&gt;Hi&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;hi&lt;/b&gt;.""</code></p>

<p>I will not know what the keyword until the user types the keyword 
and won't know the corpus (myString) until the query is run. </p>

<p>I found a solution that works most of the time, but has some false positives, 
<code>namely it would return ""&lt;b&gt;hi&lt;b/&gt;gher"" </code>which is not what I want. Also note that I 
am trying to preserve the case of the original text, and the matching should take 
place irrespective of case. so if the keyword is ""hi"" it should replace 
<code>HI with &lt;b&gt;HI&lt;/b&gt; and hi with &lt;b&gt;hi&lt;/b&gt;.</code></p>

<p>The closest I have come is using a slightly derived version of this:
<a href=""http://code.activestate.com/recipes/576715/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.activestate.com/recipes/576715/</a>
but I still could not figure out how to do a second pass of the string to fix all of the false positives mentioned above. </p>

<p>Or using the NLTK's WordPunctTokenizer (which simplifies some things like punctuation)
but I'm not sure how I would put the sentences back together given it does not 
have a reverse function and I want to keep the original punctuation of myString. Essential, doing a concatenation of all the tokens does not return the original 
string. For example I would not want to replace ""7 - 7"" with ""7-7"" when regrouping the tokens into its original text if the original text had ""7 - 7"". </p>

<p>Hope that was clear enough. Seems like a simple problem, but its a turned out a little more difficult then I thought. </p>

"<p>So, I've been tossing this idea around in my head for a while now.  At its core, it's mostly a project for me to learn programming.  The idea is that, I have a large set of data, my music collection.  There are quite a few datasets that my music has.  Format, artist, title, album, genre, length, year of release, filename, directory, just to name a few.  Ideally, I'd like to create a database that has all of this data stored in it, and in the future, create a web interface on top of it that I can manage my music collection with.  So, my questions are as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Does this sound like a good project to begin building databases from scratch with?</li>
<li>What language would you recommend I start with?  I know tidbits of PHP, but I would imagine it would be awful to index data in a filesystem with.  Python was the other language I was thinking of, considering it's the language most people consider as a beginner language.</li>
<li>If you were going to implement this kind of system (the web interface) in your home (if you had PCs connected to a couple of stereos in your home and this was the software connected), what kind of features would you want to see?</li>
</ol>

<p>My idea for building up the indexing script would be as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Get it to populate the database with only the filenames</li>
<li>From the extension of the filename, determine format</li>
<li>Get file size</li>
<li>Using the filenames in the database as a reference, pull ID3 or other applicable metadata (artist, track name, album, etc)</li>
<li>Check if all files still exist on disk, and if not, flag the file as unavailable</li>
</ul>

<p>Another script would go in later and check if the files are back, if they are not, the will remove the row from the database.</p>
","16417","","<p>I think this is a fine project to learn programming with. By using your own ""product"" you can really get after things that are missing and are much more motivated to learn and better your program - this is known as <a href=""http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000287.html"" rel=""nofollow"">dogfooding</a>. Curiously enough, the book <a href=""http://www.diveintopython.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">Dive Into Python</a>, although a little old, covers in some detail how to extract the ID3 information of music files using Python. Since that's the book most often recommended for beginners, I bet that'd be as good a place to start as any.</p>

","16417","","<p>Borrowing most of <a href=""#818875"">Guffa's answer</a>, this should do the trick as a jQuery plugin:</p>

    return this.each(function() {
        var t = parseInt($(this).text(), 10);
        $(this).data('original', t);
        var h = Math.floor(t / 3600);
        t %= 3600;
        var m = Math.floor(t / 60);
        var s = Math.floor(t % 60);
        $(this).text((h &gt; 0 ? h + ' hour' + ((h &gt; 1) ? 's ' : ' ') : '') +
                     (m &gt; 0 ? m + ' minute' + ((m &gt; 1) ? 's ' : ' ') : '') +
                     s + ' second' + ((s &gt; 1) ? 's' : ''));
    });
};
</code></pre>

<p>If you have HTML like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;span class='time'&gt;67&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='time'&gt;953&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='time'&gt;3869&lt;/span&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And you call it like this:</p>

<pre><code>$('.time').time_from_seconds();
</code></pre>

<p>The HTML is turned to:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;span class=""time""&gt;1 minute 7 seconds&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=""time""&gt;15 minutes 53 seconds&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=""time""&gt;1 hour 4 minutes 29 seconds&lt;/span&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Each element also has a <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Data"">data attribute</a> of 'original' with the seconds it originally contained.</p>

<p>My answer directly answers your question, but I'm going to take a shot in the dark: if you want to show how long ago something happened in human time (ie, ""5 minutes ago"") there is the <a href=""http://timeago.yarp.com/"">jQuery timeago plugin</a> for this.

"<p>I'm looking for a fuzzy date algorithm. I just started writing one and realised what a tedious task it is.

<p>I feel sure there must be an open source fuzzy date formatter but I can't find it. Ideally I'd like something using NSDate (OSX/iPhone) and its formatters but that isn't the difficult bit.

<li>early last month</li>

"<p>I am trying to retrieve values from a database by using JQuery Ajax to call a web service routine. The web service routine is set up properly and returns the value I require, however I'm confused about how the jquery ajax works... I don't know how to retrieve the value</p>

        type: 'POST',

such as...
   data = $.ajax({...all the settings...});

   data = $.ajax({...settings...}).responseText;</p>

","16417","","<p>The problem with what you're suggesting you'd like to do is that AJAX is an asynchronous process and trying to assign the result of the AJAX call to a variable like that would suggest the code would need to ""hang"" there until the result comes back. That's not how things are done with Javascript. Most of the time I do whatever I need to do with my data in the success callback itself. If that's not enough, the way to do it would be to have a function that accepts the data as an argument and call it when you are done. This may seem weird to you if you're coming from other languages, but in Javascript things are a lot more event based (""do this when this happens""), so you have to setup your code accordingly:</p>

<pre><code>function doStuffWithData(data) {
    // do whatever you want here
}

$.ajax({

"<p>Based on a previous stack overflow question and contribution by cgoldberg, I came up with this regex using the python re module:</p>

"<p>I've been investigating this issue that only seems to get worse the more I dig deeper.</p>

<p>I started innocently enough trying to use this expression to split a string on HTML 'br' tags:</p>

<pre><code>T = captions.innerHTML.split(/&lt;br.*?&gt;/g);
</code></pre>

<p>This works in every browser (FF, Safari, Chrome), except IE7 and IE8 with example input text like this:</p>

<pre><code>is invariably subjective. &lt;br /&gt; 
The less frequently used warnings (Probably/Possibly) &lt;br /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Please note that the example text contains a space before the '/', and precedes a new line.</p>

<p>Both of the following will match all HTML tags in every browser:</p>

<pre><code>T = captions.innerHTML.split(/&lt;.*?&gt;/g);
T = captions.innerHTML.split(/&lt;.+?&gt;/g);
</code></pre>

<p>However, surprisingly (to me at least), this <em>does not</em> work in FF and Chrome:</p>

<pre><code>T = captions.innerHTML.split(/&lt;br.+?&gt;/g);
</code></pre>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>This (suggested several times in the responses below,) does not work on IE 7 or 8:</p>

<pre><code>T = captions.innerHTML.split(/&lt;br[^&gt;]*&gt;/g);
</code></pre>

<p>(It did work on Chrome and FF.)</p>

<p>My question is: does anyone know an expression that works in all current browsers to match the 'br' tags above (but not other HTML tags).  And can anyone confirm that the last example above should be a valid match since two characters are present in the example text before the '>'.</p>

<p>PS - my doctype is HTML transitional.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>I think I have evidence this is specific to the string.split() behavior on IE, and not regex in general.  You have to use split() to see this issue.  I have also found a test matrix that shows a failure rate of about 30% for split() test cases when I ran it on IE.  The same tests passed 100% on FF and Chrome:</p>

<p><a href=""http://stevenlevithan.com/demo/split.cfm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stevenlevithan.com/demo/split.cfm</a></p>

<p>So far, I have still not found a solution for IE, and the library provided by the author of that test matrix did not fix this case.</p>
","16417","","<p>The reason your code is not working is because IE parses the HTML and makes the tags uppercase when you read it through innerHTML. For example, if you have HTML like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id='box'&gt;
Hello&lt;br&gt;
World
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And then you use this Javascript (in IE):</p>

<pre><code>alert(document.getElementById('box').innerHTML);
</code></pre>

<p>You will get an alert box with this:</p>

<pre><code>Hello&lt;BR&gt;World
</code></pre>

<p>Notice the <code>&lt;BR&gt;</code> is now uppercase. To fix this, just add the <code>i</code> flag in addition to the <code>g</code> flag to make the regex be case-insensitive and it will work as you expect.</p>

<li><p><strong>Use the file with another language</strong>.  If you ever wanted to have a Perl, Python, Ruby, etc. script do something that is particularly easy with that language and needed to access the project settings you would be out of luck if you stored your settings in a PHP file.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Human editing of data</strong>. Although you dismissed it in your question, intentions or not it is very likely someone might end up poking in there and it may not be a technical individual. The INI format is a lot less scary than PHP code, even if it is just a bunch of variable declarations</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Updating the settings</strong>. I think it is much easier to create a new INI file rather than writing a PHP file. This is pretty subjective, however, but it is worth mentioning.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Relationship between setting variables</strong>. It is fairly easy/intuitive to give your settings a hierarchy with a INI file. While this would also be possible with PHP it is not as neat and can get unsightly if you are trying to do deeply nested associative arrays to store information.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to those, the knock on INI of ""having to protect it against web access"" is not relevant in most scenarios as most PHP projects (at least the ones I'm part of) hold a fair amount of code away from the root folder, and the settings usually go there.</p>

"<p>I'm using a jQuery and the tablesorter plugin in my web page.  My goal is to add the tablesorter header disable parser to each header whose class is empty using its metadata inline insertion functionality. I have three functions outlined, the first is the class that adds the disable parser to each header with a blank class(""""), the second will perform class switching operations on headers that don't have blank classes to begin with and the third will call the actual tablesorter, once all headers are set.</p>

<pre><code>$(function(){
    //Code is supposed to add the disable parser to each header with a blank class
    $(""th"").each(function(){
        if ($(this).hasClass('')){$(this).addClass('{sorter: 'false'}');
    });
});


$(function() {
    //Code manipulates headers with non-blank classes
}); 

$(function() {
    //Call tablesorter on all tables once their headers are set.
    $(""table"").tablesorter({}); 
});
</code></pre>

<p>So far the second and third functions work as expected, although I eventually plan on extending the second function even further, once I can get the issues with the first function sorted out.  This leads me to my problem and that is that the first function to add the parser doesn't seem to add the class at all and furthermore, since it's not working properly, it seems to prevent the second and third from working.  These functions will work if I take away the first function; I'm not sure if I have the syntax wrong or if I can even add the parser dynamically in this manner.  Below is a sample of headers from the HTML:</p>

<p>Since the click handler is happening to the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>, you could also traverse up to the parent DIV, then search down for the second DIV.

","16417","","<p>Well since I wrote that I guess I might as well answer this too ;)</p>

<p>The 'common' way of doing this is by having an indicator variable that the request is in progress and updating it accordingly before/after everything happens. For my code in that question, you would edit it as follows:</p>

<p>Outside of the click function, add this:</p>

<pre><code>var voting = false; // not initially voting
</code></pre>

<p>Inside the click function, at the very top, add this:</p>

<pre><code>if(voting) return false; // if voting, return
voting = true; // if not, set voting to true
</code></pre>

<p>Inside of both post callbacks, add this:</p>

<pre><code>voting = false; // done voting, set back to false
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to maintain an indicator on a per-question/answer/item basis, you could do this:</p>

<p>First, replace this code:</p>

<pre><code>var id = $(this).parents('div.answer').attr('id').split('_')[1];
</code></pre>

<p>With this:</p>

<pre><code>var parent = $(this).parents('div.answer'); // get the parent div
if(parent.data('voting')) return false; // if voting, return
parent.data('voting', true); // if not, update the marker
var id = parent.attr('id').split('_')[1]; // get the id
</code></pre>

<p>Then inside both post callbacks, add this:</p>

<pre><code>parent.data('voting', false); // done voting, set back to false
</code></pre>

<p>In this case we'd be using jQuery's <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Core"" rel=""nofollow"">data</a> to store the voting status of a particular question/answer/item inside the containing DIV and updating it accordingly whenever something happens.</p>

"<p>Please forgive the awkwardness of this question, I honestly don't know how to phrase a better query...</p>

<p>The situation:</p>

<p>I have a basic contact form within an xhtml/php page that I'm in the process of upgrading.  I recently added a new unrelated jquery plugin on this page, so I would like to use the jquery functionality to help with some simple form validation if possible.  The validation is already being done via PHP in a separate file submitted by the contact form.</p>

<p>What I want to happen, is for the PHP validation message to be passed back to the main (contact form) page without a new pageload.  I've seen this done by means of jquery somewhere, but I can't seem to find it again either here or via google.  Can anyone help?</p>

<p>I'm really looking for speed and simplicity here, and at first glance, the jquery validation plugin is daunting in its size and complexity, so I'm loath to embark on that particular route...</p>
","16417","","<p>What you are looking for is known as AJAX, and there's nothing hard about it, especially with jQuery! The problem with sending the data to PHP to validate is that it would immediately nix your requirement for ""speed"" - the form would need to hang while Javascript makes a request to the server to see if everything is alright. For this reason, it is common practice to have validation done in <em>both</em> server and client side. Note I'm saying both, as you should <em>always</em> validate data on the server.</p>

<p>With this in mind, let's get started! I am going to show how to validate a form without using the validation plugin - for bigger projects, you might want to consider it, but it is easy enough without it:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form id='myform' action='whatever.php' method='POST'&gt;
First Name: &lt;input type='text' name='first_name' class='required'&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Last Name: &lt;input type='text' name='last_name'&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Email: &lt;input type='text' name='email' class='required'&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Zip: &lt;input type='text' name='zip'&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So as you can see we have first name and email with a class of required, so we can do this:</p>

<pre><code>$(function() { // wait for the document to be loaded
    $('#myform').submit(function() {
        var valid = true; // assume everything is okay
        // loop through each required field in this form
        $('input.required', this).each(function() {
            // if the field is empty, mark valid as false
            // and add an error class
            if($.trim($(this).val()) == '') {
                valid = false;
                $(this).addClass('error_input');
            }
        });

        // additional validation for email, zip, perhaps

        return valid; // if valid is true, continue form submission
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>The Validation plugin makes this all a little neater and cleaner to do, but if you just need to do a quick form there is nothing wrong with the approach above. It does suck because you have to have your validation rules in two places, but apart from executing Javascript on the server or calling the server for the data there is no alternative if you want to quickly tell your users something is wrong.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Seems I misunderstood your question. If you want to pass the form data to a PHP script, have it validate the values, and return success or error back to the page without a load, you would do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>$('#myform').submit(function() {
    // allow submit if we've validated this already
    if($(this).data('done')) return true;
    var data = $(this).serialize(); // serialize the form data
    // you could get the two variables below from the actual form (DRY)
    // with $(this).attr('action'); and $(this).attr('method'); but I am
    // not sure if that is what you want...
    var action = 'validate.php'; // what script will process this
    var method = 'POST'; // type of request to make
    $.ajax({
        type: method,
        url: action, 
        data: data,
        dataType: 'json',
        success: function(d) {
            if(d.code == 'success') {
                 // everything went alright, submit
                 $(this).data('done', true).submit();
            } else {
                 alert('something is wrong!');
            }
        }
    });
    return false; // don't submit until we hear back from server   
});
</code></pre>

<p>And then all your PHP script has to do is return something like this, using <a href=""http://www.php.net"" rel=""nofollow""><code>json_encode</code></a>, to indicate whether everything is alright or not:</p>

<pre><code>// verify everything...
// data will be in $_POST just like a normal request
if($everythingOK) {
    $code = 'success';
} else {
    $code = 'error';
}
print json_encode(array('code' =&gt; $code));
exit;
</code></pre>

<p>I haven't tested the Javascript above, but I am pretty sure it should be about right. I hope <em>this</em> helps. :)</p>

<p>Guido says the following when closing the above ticket:</p>

  <p>I'm very sorry, but I have to close this as invalid.</p>
  
  <p>The App Engine definition of the choices parameter to the db.Property class is

  <p>I realize that this may cause problems when you're trying to create a form from the
  model, but the solution is to override the form field using a custom widget and
  passing the list of desired choices to the widget.  (There's an example of this in

","16417","","<p>To do this you have to use the <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Selectors/checked""><code>:checked</code></a> selector. Although <a href=""#849194"">JP's answer</a> is fine, I'd probably do this:</p>

<ul>
<li>I think it reads better to use the <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Is""><code>is</code></a> function, which returns a boolean of the selector.</li>
<li>You can use <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Selectors/radio""><code>:radio</code></a> and <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Selectors/checkbox""><code>:checkbox</code></a> as a shortcut for selecting all radios and checkboxes in a form. However, <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Selectors/checkbox"">according to the jQuery manual</a>, it is bad practice to use these selectors without specifying <code>input</code> before them, as they evaluate to <code>*:checkbox</code> and <code>*:radio</code> otherwise, which are very slow selectors.</li>
<li>By passing <code>this</code> as the second argument we are <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Core/jQuery#expressioncontext"">specifying a context</a> for the search, and thus are only searching for checkboxes and radio inputs inside the current form. Without it we might get false positives if there happens to be another form in the page.</li>

"<p>I'm using ASP.Net MVC, but this applies to any framework. </p>

<p>I'm making an Ajax call to my server, which most of the time returns plain old HTML, however if there is an error, I'd like it to return a JSON object with a status message (and a few other things). There doesn't appear to be a way for the <code>dataType</code> option in the jQuery call to handle this well. By default it seems to parse everything as html, leading to a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> being populated with <code>""{ status: 'error', message: 'something bad happened'}""</code>.</p>

<p>[Edit] Ignoring the <code>dataType</code> object and letting jQuery figure out doesn't work either. It views the type of the result as a <code>string</code> and treats it as HTML.</p>

<p>One solution I came up with is to attempt to parse the result object as JSON. If that works we know it's a JSON object. If it throws an exception, it's HTML:</p>

<pre><code>$.ajax({
    data: {},
    success: function(data, textStatus) {
        try {
            var errorObj = JSON.parse(data);
            handleError(errorObj);
        } catch(ex) {
            $('#results').html(data);
        }
    },
    dataType: 'html', // sometimes it is 'json' :-/
    url: '/home/AjaxTest',
    type: 'POST'
});
</code></pre>

<p>However, using an Exception in that way strikes me as pretty bad design (and unintuitive to say the least). Is there a better way? I thought of wrapping the entire response in a JSON object, but in this circumstance, I don't think that's an option.</p>

<p>Here's the solution that I got from Steve Willcock:</p>

<pre><code>// ASP.NET MVC Action:
[AcceptVerbs(HttpVerbs.Post)]
public ActionResult AjaxTest(int magic) {
    try {
        var someVal = GetValue();
        return PartialView(""DataPage"", someVal);
    } catch (Exception ex) {
        this.HttpContext.Response.StatusCode = 500;
        return Json(new { status = ""Error"", message = ex.Message });
    }
}




// jQuery call:

$.ajax({
    data: {},
    success: function(data, textStatus) {
        $('#results').html(data);
    },
    error: function() {
        var errorObj = JSON.parse(XMLHttpRequest.responseText);
        handleError(errorObj);
    },
    dataType: 'html',
    url: '/home/AjaxTest',
    type: 'POST'
});
</code></pre>
","16417","","<p>While Steve's idea is a good one, I'm adding this in for completeness.</p>

<p>It appears that if you specify a dataType of json but return HTML, jQuery handles it fine.</p>

<p>I tested this theory with the following code:</p>

<pre><code>if($_GET['type'] == 'json') {
    header('Content-type: application/json');
    print '{""test"":""hi""}';
    exit;
} else {
    header('Content-type: text/html');
    print '&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;b&gt;Test&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;';
    exit;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>$_GET['type']</code> is just so I can control what to return while testing. In your situation you'd return one or the other depending on whether things went right or wrong. Past that, with this jQuery code:</p>

<pre><code>$.ajax({
    url: 'php.php?type=html', // return HTML in this test
    dataType: 'json',
    success: function(d) {
        console.log(typeof d); // 'xml'
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>Even though we specified JSON as the dataType, jQuery (1.3.2) figures out that its not that.</p>

<pre><code>$.ajax({
    url: 'php.php?type=json',
    dataType: 'json',
    success: function(d) {
        console.log(typeof d); // 'object'
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>So you could take advantage of this (as far as I know) undocumented behavior to do what you want.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>I just learned the hard way that JavaScript thinks the leading zero indicates an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octal"">octal integer</a>, and since there is no ""8"" or ""9"" in base-8, the function returns zero.

<p>This is a tricky proposition, however, as I am sure there are situations in which whatever output this gives may not be the ""correct"" way to write a particular city, although I can't think of any examples off the top of my head I am sure there are some.</p>

<p>I'm also noticing there are a few lines that just have a country (""US"") and some that just have a city (""HONG KONG"") - there's no reliable way to determine what the string contains.

$('input:hidden:last','#mydiv'); // get last one using last
$('input:hidden','#mydiv').eq(0); // get first one using eq
$('input:hidden','#mydiv').eq(1); // get second one using eq
$('input:hidden','#mydiv').eq(2); // get third one using eq
$('input:hidden:eq(0)','#mydiv'); // get first one using eq in selector

<li><a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Selectors/first"" rel=""nofollow""><code>first</code></a> - get the first matched element in the collection.</li>
<li><a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Selectors/last"" rel=""nofollow""><code>last</code></a> - get the last matched element in the collection.</li>
<li><a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Traversing/eq#index"" rel=""nofollow""><code>eq(N)</code></a> - get the Nth matched element, 0 based.</li>

<p>I am personally a fan of option 3 as I don't like having too much crap in my selector.</p>

<p>One caveat of the above is that by using the <code>:hidden</code> selector we might match other input elements that are hidden (ie, not visible). If you expect that to happen, or even if you don't, you could do this:</p>

<p>I am not a Rails developer, but I do know it uses ActiveRecord. I am sure, however, that there is also a way to make it execute raw queries as most ORM do. Right there however you're going against the grain of what the framework wants you do and you may run into problems.</p>

<p>Anything that abstracts out things for you, particularly database relationships, is going to be far from efficient. Worrying about it beforehand is usually not necessary, and once your application is finished it is common practice to then identify any particular slow queries and redo them by hand if necessary.</p>

"<p>I keep ending up at this situation where I want to use a dictionary very much like the one 'locals' gives back, but that only contains the variables in the limited scope of the function. Is there a way to do this in python? </p>

<p>A bit more about why I want to do this: I'm playing with Django and when I go to give my templates context, I am forced either to either manually make a dictionary (In violation with DRY principles) or pass in locals() which contains far more entries then are needed (wasteful). Is there perhaps something I'm missing with django which would alleviate the need of a python level solution?</p>

<p>To Clarify:</p>

<p>So, the case that I've hit repeatedly is where I have: </p>

<pre><code>@render_to('my_template.html') 
def myview(request): 
    var1 = #blahblah 
    var2 = #... 
    # do stuff with vars 
    return {'var1': val1,'var2':val2}
</code></pre>

<p>So instead of repeating those variables and naming conventions, I'll do: </p>

<pre><code>@render_to('my_template.html') 
def myview(request): 
    var1 = #blahblah 
    var2 = #... 
    # do stuff with vars 
    return locals()
</code></pre>

<p>Which I find cleaner, but I know its kind of sloppy since there are about 30 more entries in locals() then I actually need. </p>
","16417","","<p>How is passing a dictionary a violation of DRY? <a href=""http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/misc/design-philosophies/#don-t-repeat-yourself-dry"" rel=""nofollow"">Django is all about DRY</a>, so I doubt the standard behavior of it would directly violate it. In either case, however, I use a modified version of <a href=""http://bitbucket.org/offline/django-annoying/wiki/Home"" rel=""nofollow"">django-annoying</a> to make the whole thing easier:</p>

<pre><code>@render_to('my_template.html')
def myview(request):
    # figure stuff out...
    return {'var1':'val1','var2','val2'}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>render_to</code> decorator takes care of the request context and all that good stuff. Works well.</p>

<p>If this doesn't help, I suggest rephrasing your question. Whatever you want to do messing around with <code>locals()</code> and such is rarely necessary especially in this kind of situation with Django.</p>

"<p>How can you display a long string, website address, word or set of symbols with automatic line breaks to keep a div width? I guess a wordwrap of sorts. Usually adding a space works but is there a CSS solution such as word-wrap?</p>

<li><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/850055/css-overflow-with-long-url"">CSS overflow with long URL</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Long story short:</p>

<p>As far as CSS solutions go you have: <code>overflow: scroll;</code> to force the element to show scrollbars and <code>overflow:hidden;</code> to just cut off any extra text. There is <code>text-overflow:ellipsis;</code> and <code>word-wrap: break-word;</code> but they are IE only (<code>break-word</code> is in the CSS3 draft, however, so it will be the solution to this 5 years from now).</p>

<p>Bottom line is that if it is very important for you to stop this from happening with wrapping the text over to the next line the only reasonable solution is to inject  <code>&amp;shy;</code> (soft hyphen), <a href=""http://www.quirksmode.org/oddsandends/wbr.html""><code>&lt;wbr&gt;</code></a> (word break tag), or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-width%5Fspace""><code>&amp;#8203;</code></a> (zero-width space, same effect as <code>&amp;shy;</code> minus hyphen) in your string server side.

"<p>I'm a beginner and this is my first time encountering problem like this.</p>

<p>I'm iterating a class using the each method provided by jQuery. The page have many class with the same name. So we can expect that it may be 15 iterations.</p>

<p>Each iteration have different value.</p>

<pre><code>$("".book"").each(function(n) {

<p>The $(this tbody tr:last) wouldn't work also. How can I devised a selector that will work?</p>

","16417","","<p>Assuming the HTML you posted there is a single book and there are many others exactly like it, and you want access to the last <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code> in each one of them, this should work:</p>

    var value = $(this).find('td').eq(1).text();
});
</code></pre>

<p><code>value</code> would then be ""List"" with the HTML above, and if you have several <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s it would iterate as you might expect through the last <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code> of each one of them.</p>

<p>The key here is that we are using <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Selectors/lastChild"" rel=""nofollow""><code>last-child</code></a> instead of simply <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Selectors/last"" rel=""nofollow""><code>last</code></a>. The <code>last</code> documentation says that it will match the last selected element; we don't want that. What we want instead is what <code>last-child</code> describes: Matches all elements that are the last child of their parent. This distinction is important in this particular case as we only want the last child of the particular table we're currently in, we don't want the last result overall.</p>

<p>If you wanted the last <code>&lt;td&gt;</code> in each last <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code>, we could even do this:</p>

<pre><code>$('div.book tbody tr:last-child td:last-child').each(function() {
    var value = $(this).text();
});
</code></pre>

<p>This selector would select each last child <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code> and select its appropiate last-child <code>&lt;td&gt;</code>. This would be best if you don't care what the value of the first <code>&lt;td&gt;</code> is. If you do then you want to use the first one.</p>

","16417","","<p>Although without some code there's no way to really know for your particular situation, any delays will not be with the Javascript unless you are doing something that will obviously take a lot of browser resources (sorting large tables, adding large amount of HTML, etc.) If all you're doing is grabbing the data, serializing it, and sending it over with AJAX over to the server and it is taking a long time to respond, then the problem is with the server-side code.

} else {
   // Error placement for single elements
   offset = element.offset();

"<p>I don't want to know a way to preload images, I found much on the net, but I want to know how it works.
How is javascript able to preload images?
I mean, I tried a snippet from here, and even if it works, it doesn't seem to preload images.</p>

<p>When I check firebug, I can see that the image is loaded twice, once while the preloading, another time when displaying it!</p>

<p>To improve this code I'd like to know how it works.</p>

<p>Here is what i do:</p>

<pre><code> function preload(arrayOfImages) {
        $(arrayOfImages).each(function(){
    	    $('&lt;img/&gt;')[0].src = this;
    	    //(new Image()).src = this;
    	    alert(this +'  &amp;&amp;   ' + i++);

        });
    }
</code></pre>

<p>then i do something like that:</p>

<pre><code>preloader = function() {
    preload(myImages);
}

$(document).ready(preloader);
</code></pre>

<p>Here is how i display/add the image :</p>

<pre><code>$(""li.works"").click(function() {
    		 $(""#viewer"").children().empty();
    		 $('#viewer').children().append('&lt;img src=\'images/ref/'+this.firstChild.id+'.jpg\' alt=""'+this.firstChild.id+'"" \/&gt;')
    	     $(""#viewer"").children().fadeIn();
</code></pre>
","16417","","<p>Your basic Javascript preloader does this:</p>

<pre><code>var image = new Image();
image.src = '/path/to/the/image.jpg';
</code></pre>

<p>The way it works is simply by creating a new Image object and setting the src of it, the browser is going to go grab the image. We're not adding <em>this</em> particular image to the browser, but when the time comes to show the image in the page via whatever method we have setup, the browser will already have it in its cache and will not go fetch it again. I can't really tell you why whatever you have isn't working this way without looking at the code, though.</p>

<p>One interesting gotcha that is discussed <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/761263/what-is-the-best-way-to-preload-multiple-images-in-javascript"">in this question</a> is what happens when you have an array of images and try preloading them all by using the same Image object:</p>

<pre><code>var images = ['image1.jpg','image2.jpg'];
var image = new Image();
for(var x = 0; x &lt; images.length; x++) {
    image.src = images[x];
}
</code></pre>

<p>This will only preload the last image as the rest will not have time to preload before the loop comes around again to change the source of the object. <a href=""http://www.rootspot.com/stackoverflow/preload.php"">View an example of this</a>. You should be able to instantly see the second image once you click on the button, but the first one will have to load as it didn't get a chance to preload when you try to view it.</p>

<p>As such, the proper way to do many at once would be:</p>

<pre><code>var images = ['image1.jpg','image2.jpg'];
for(var x = 0; x &lt; images.length; x++) {
    var image = new Image();
    image.src = images[x];

","16417","","<p>I can't answer why the cookie is not showing in your Vista folder, but that code properly sets and reads cookies as intended. How are you testing it? An easier way to test whether the cookies are sticking is by simply doing something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type=""button"" value=""Set"" onClick=""createCookie('test','yay',5);""&gt;
&lt;input type=""button"" value=""Read"" onClick=""alert(readCookie('test'));""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You can refresh the page between Setting and Reading it if makes you feel better, but <a href=""http://jsbin.com/abeye"" rel=""nofollow"">it works for me</a>.</p>

<p>If that doesn't show what you're expecting, make sure your browser is setup to accept cookies. :)</p>

"<p>Is there any direct way in JavaScript or jQuery to check if an element is within another one.</p>

<p>I'm not referring to the <code>$(this).parent</code> as the element I wish to find can be a random number steps lower in the tree of elements.</p>

<p>As an example, I would like to check if <code>&lt; div id=""THIS DIV""&gt;</code> would be within <code>&lt; div id=""THIS PARENT""&gt;</code>:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""THIS_PARENT""&gt;

   &lt;div id=""random""&gt;
    &lt;div id=""THIS_DIV""&gt;

<p>So in pseudo code:</p>

<pre><code> if($(""div#THIS_DIV"").isWithin(""div#THIS_PARENT"")) ...
</code></pre>

<p>If there isn't any direct way I'll probably do a function for this but still it's worth asking.</p>
","16417","","<p>You could do this:</p>

<pre><code>if($('#THIS_DIV','#THIS_PARENT').length == 1) {

}
</code></pre>

<p>By <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Core/jQuery#expressioncontext"">specifying a context</a> for the search (the second argument) we are basically saying ""look for an element with an ID of <code>#THIS_DIV</code> within an element with ID of <code>#THIS_PARENT</code>"". This is the most succint way of doing it using jQuery.</p>

<p>We could also write it like this, using <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Traversing/find""><code>find</code></a>, if it makes more sense to you:</p>

<pre><code>if($('#THIS_PARENT').find('#THIS_DIV').length == 1) {

}
</code></pre>

<p>Or like this, using <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/API/1.2/Traversing/parents""><code>parents</code></a>, if you want to search from the child upwards:</p>

<pre><code>if($('#THIS_DIV').parents('#THIS_PARENT').length == 1) {

}
</code></pre>

<p>Any of these should work fine. The <code>length</code> bit is necessary to make sure the length of the ""search"" is > 0. I would of course personally recommend you go with the first one as it's the simplest.</p>

<p>Also, if you are referring to an element by ID it's not necessary (although of course perfectly okay) to preface the selector with the tag name. As far as speed, though, it doesn't really help as jQuery is going to use the native <code>getElementById()</code> internally. Using the tag name is only important when selecting by class, as <code>div.myclass</code> is much, much faster than <code>.myclass</code> if only <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> elements are going to have the particular class.</p>

<p>All you have to do is cancel the click event with Javascript to prevent the default action from happening.

Essentially, add an extra field to your form with a common name like ""email"" and hide it with CSS. Mark it as ""leave blank"" for anyone browsing with styles disabled.

"<p>I have just recently battled a bug in Python. It was one of those silly newbie bugs, but it got me thinking about the mechanisms of Python (I'm a long time C++ programmer, new to Python). I will lay out the buggy code and explain what I did to fix it, and then I have a couple of questions...</p>

<p>The scenario: I have a class called A, that has a dictionary data member, following is its code (this is simplification of course):</p>

<pre><code>class A:
    dict1={}

    def add_stuff_to_1(self, k, v):
    	self.dict1[k]=v

    def print_stuff(self):
    	print(self.dict1)
</code></pre>

<p>The class using this code is class B:</p>

<pre><code>class B:

    def do_something_with_a1(self):
    	a_instance = A()
    	a_instance.print_stuff()  		
    	a_instance.add_stuff_to_1('a', 1)
    	a_instance.add_stuff_to_1('b', 2)    
    	a_instance.print_stuff()

    def do_something_with_a2(self):
    	a_instance = A()    
    	a_instance.print_stuff()    		
    	a_instance.add_stuff_to_1('c', 1)
    	a_instance.add_stuff_to_1('d', 2)    
    	a_instance.print_stuff()

    def do_something_with_a3(self):
    	a_instance = A()    
    	a_instance.print_stuff()    		
    	a_instance.add_stuff_to_1('e', 1)
    	a_instance.add_stuff_to_1('f', 2)    
    	a_instance.print_stuff()

    def __init__(self):
    	self.do_something_with_a1()
    	print(""---"")
    	self.do_something_with_a2()
    	print(""---"")
    	self.do_something_with_a3()
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that every call to <code>do_something_with_aX()</code> initializes a new ""clean"" instance of class A, and prints the dictionary before and after the addition.</p>

<p>The bug (in case you haven't figured it out yet):</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; b_instance = B()
{}
{'a': 1, 'b': 2}
---
{'a': 1, 'b': 2}
{'a': 1, 'c': 1, 'b': 2, 'd': 2}
---
{'a': 1, 'c': 1, 'b': 2, 'd': 2}
{'a': 1, 'c': 1, 'b': 2, 'e': 1, 'd': 2, 'f': 2}
</code></pre>

<p>In the second initialization of class A, the dictionaries are not empty, but start with the contents of the last initialization, and so forth. I expected them to start ""fresh"".</p>

<p>What solves this ""bug"" is obviously adding:</p>

<pre><code>self.dict1 = {}
</code></pre>

<p>In the <code>__init__</code> constructor of class A. However, that made me wonder:</p>

<ol>
<li>What is the meaning of the ""dict1 = {}"" initialization at the point of dict1's declaration (first line in class A)? It is meaningless?</li>
<li>What's the mechanism of instantiation that causes copying the reference from the last initialization? </li>
<li>If I add ""self.dict1 = {}"" in the constructor (or any other data member), how does it not affect the dictionary member of previously initialized instances?</li>
</ol>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>EDIT: Following the answers I now understand that by declaring a data member and not referring to it in the <code>__init__</code> or somewhere else as self.dict1, I'm practically defining what's called in C++/Java a static data member. By calling it self.dict1 I'm making it ""instance-bound"".</p>
","16417","","<p>What you keep referring to as a bug is the <a href=""http://docs.python.org/tutorial/classes.html"">documented</a>, standard behavior of Python classes.</p>

<p>Declaring a dict outside of <code>__init__</code> as you initially did is declaring a class-level variable. It is only created once at first, whenever you create new objects it will reuse this same dict. To create instance variables, you declare them with <code>self</code> in <code>__init__</code>; its as simple as that.</p>

<p>Why? This is a feature of the language. There's no reason to not trust it. A lot of websites are running just fine counting on PHP to close their stuff. As programmers, of course, we want to close it ourselves. That's fine. But opening and closing a database connection for every query is a <em>horrible</em> idea. The better way to do it is to call <code>open()</code> from your constructor, and rename your <code>close()</code> to <a href=""http://us2.php.net/language.oop5.decon"" rel=""nofollow""><code>__destruct()</code></a>. According to the documentation, <code>__destruct</code> will be called ""as soon as all references to a particular object are removed or when the object is explicitly destroyed or in any order in shutdown sequence.""  Sounds like an ideal place to stash away the closing code for your database connection.</p>

"<p>How to set radio option checked onload with jQuery? </p>

&lt;input type='radio' name='gender' value='Female'&gt;

<pre><code>$(function() {
    var $radios = $('input:radio[name=gender]');

&lt;?=""hello world!""?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Also, is it necessary to close all scripts with <code>?&gt;</code></p>
","16417","","<p>The difference is that some servers might have the first and last examples disabled via <a href=""http://www.php.net/ini.core"" rel=""nofollow""><code>short_open_tag</code></a>. So if you want your code to be as portable as possible you should use the full <code>&lt;?php</code>, otherwise when you move your code to a new server you might find it doesn't work as expected. Also using the short tags can cause clashes if you try doing <code>&lt;?xml</code> type declarations. As far as security, using short tags can theoretically be dangerous if someone decides to turn <code>short_open_tag</code> off; code using that tag would then be plain-text and broadcast to all (check the comments for more)</p>

<p>As for your other question, omitting the closing tags is to prevent whitespace from being accidentally outputted to the browser, as this would mess some scripts up, particularly those trying to output headers of any kind. This is why the <a href=""http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/coding-standard.php-file-formatting.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Zend Programming Guide</a> recommends not closing your PHP tags.</p>

<p>Now that I got all that out of the way, unless I'm working on something that is open source I  <em>personally</em> use short open tags and I close all of my PHP tags.  This is because I am usually in control of my environment and I'm of the opinion that a) <code>&lt;?=</code> is just too handy, and b) if you open something you ought to close it. The ""best practices"", however, don't really agree with that.</p>

"<p>Writing a small app that (<em>among other things</em>) lets users upload a file (<em>like an image, a  .doc or a text file</em>) as part of their posting/submission.</p>

<p>Our current prototype just dumps the file into <strong>/{app_root}/files/</strong>, but of course, anyone can get to that even if they are not logged in or using the system. The goal is to only grant access (<em>view access</em>) to the files if user is logged in and does in fact have access to the post that the file belongs to.</p>

<p>I am thinking of either creating a folder outside the <strong>/web/</strong> (<em>http</em>) folder and then having PHP render it somehow using <strong>header()</strong> commans, or, maybe just dumping the file into the database? I have never done either one, however.</p>

<ol>
<li>Move all the files out of the webroot. You <em>could</em> disable access to the folder with .htaccess, but it is not worth the hassle and potential security risk. Just move it out there.</li>
<li>Keep a table of the files uploaded, storing the user's original file name there. Rename the file to <code>$id.$ext</code> and so on. In short, you don't want to use the user's file name in your system.</li>
<li>Have a script, <code>download.php</code> or whatever, get the file's ID, verify who is logged in, and if everything checks out, fetch the file, read it out to the browser, and send the appropriate download headers.</li>
</ol>

<p>These headers would be something like:</p>

<p>CONCLUSION:</p>

<p>Thanks for all the solutions, most of all of them answered my original question. Much PROPS to all :)</p>
","16417","","<p>The proper way to achieve the functionality you want is just to remove the options. As you discovered the hard way, disabling individual options is not supported particularly well across browsers. I just woke up and feel like programming something so I whipped up a small plugin to easily filter a select based on a radio's selected ID attribute. Although the rest of the solutions will get the job done, if you are planning on doing this throughout your app this should help. If not, then I guess it's for anyone else that stumbles upon this. Here is the plugin code you could stash away somewhere:</p>

<pre><code>jQuery.fn.filterOn = function(radio, values) {
    return this.each(function() {
        var select = this;
        var options = [];
        $(select).find('option').each(function() {
            options.push({value: $(this).val(), text: $(this).text()});
        });
        $(select).data('options', options);
        $(radio).click(function() {
            var options = $(select).empty().data('options');
            var haystack = values[$(this).attr('id')];
            $.each(options, function(i) {
                var option = options[i];

<pre><code>$(function() {
    $('#theOptions').filterOn('input:radio[name=abc123]', {
        'abc': ['a','b','c'],
        '123': ['1','2','3']        
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>The first argument is a selector for the radio group, the second a dictionary where the keys are the radio ID to match, and the value is an array of what select option values should remain. There's a lot of things that could be done to abstract this further, let me know if you are interested and I could certainly do that.</p>

<p><a href=""http://jsbin.com/anoci"">Here is a demo of it in action</a>.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.answers.com"">http://www.answers.com</a></p>

<p>if the user double clicks on any word in the page, a pop up box will show up and shows the definition for that word.</p>

<p>I can think of a way to use DOM scripting to break up all words in the page and then make each of them go under a separate ""span"" element... but otherwise isn't it true that if all the text is under a ""p"" element, then the ""p"" element node get triggered to handle the double click event, but there is no easy way of telling which word is clicked on?  </p>
","16417","","<p>You simply add a double click event to the entire document, like so:</p>

<pre><code>function get_selection() {
    var txt = '';
    if (window.getSelection) {
        txt = window.getSelection();
    } else if (document.getSelection) {
        txt = document.getSelection();

    return txt;
}

$(document).dblclick(function(e) {
    var t = get_selection();
    alert(t);
});

<p>If you only wanted this to work on select paragraphs, you would change the selector to <code>p.myclass</code> or something like that. This hinges on the fact double clicking a word highlights it in browsers. Not really sure if it's exactly how answers.com does it, to be honest.</p>

"<p>I am writing a jQuery plugin and I am at the optimization stage.</p>

<p>I wonder which of these leads to a quicker script in general, and what sort of mitigating factors are important:</p>

<ol>
<li>Have the script generate lots of classes and ids at the start so finding elements in the dom is easier (quicker too?) later on.</li>
<li>Keep classes and ids to a minimum (so save time by not creating them), but then look for elements in more convoluted ways later (eg the nth item in an object), which I presume is slower than getting by id/class.</li>
</ol>
","16417","","<p>The question is not really specific enough so I can give you advice directly relevant to your code, but here are some of my favorite jQuery optimization tips:</p>

<ol>
<li>Whenever possible, specify a context! Don't make jQuery look places it doesn't have to. If you know that something is going to be inside the <code>#container</code> div, then do <code>$(something, '#container');</code></li>
<li><code>.myclass</code> is <em>slow</em>. Internally, jQuery has to go through <em>every single</em> element to see if it has the class you are searching for, at least for those browsers not supporting <code>getElementsByClassName</code>. If you know that a class will only be applied to a certain element, it is <em>way</em> faster to do <code>tag.myclass</code>, as jQuery can then use the native <code>getElementsByTagName</code> and only search through those.</li>
<li>Don't do complicated selectors in one bang. Sure, jQuery can figure out what you want, but it takes time to parse out the string and apply the logic you want to it. As such, I always like to separate my ""queries"" out into patches. While most people might do <code>$('#myform input:eq(2)');</code> or something like that, I prefer to do <code>$('input','#myform').eq(2);</code> to help jQuery out.</li>
<li>Don't re-query the DOM if you plan on doing multiple things with a set of objects. Take advantange of chaining, and if not possible to use chaining for whatever reason, cache the results of the query into a variable and perform your calls on that.</li>
</ol>

Because we need consistency webUI.

        var state = $activeCheckbox.attr('checked');

        $activeCheckbox.attr('checked', state);

","16417","","<p>Here's a hint: Use radio buttons. ;)</p>

<p>I wouldn't recommend doing this because it would be considered bad for usability and would certainly violate the principle of least surprise. Users have been conditioned to expect radios to accept 1 check and checkboxes to accept many. <a href=""http://www.sensible.com/"">Don't make your users think.</a></p>

<p>If you have your reasons, though, here's how to go about doing this with jQuery:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type='checkbox' name='mygroup1' value='1' class='unique'&gt;
&lt;input type='checkbox' name='mygroup2' value='2' class='unique'&gt;
&lt;input type='checkbox' name='mygroup3' value='3' class='unique'&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And the jQuery:</p>

<pre><code>var $unique = $('input.unique');
$unique.click(function() {
    $unique.filter(':checked').not(this).removeAttr('checked');
});
</code></pre>

<p>And here's a <a href=""http://jsbin.com/uwewi"">live sample</a>.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:</p>

<p>As pointed out in the comments, this would allow the user to deselect all checkboxes even if they chose one initially, which isn't exactly like radio buttons. If you want this, then the jQuery would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>var $unique = $('input.unique');
$unique.click(function() {
    $unique.removeAttr('checked');
    $(this).attr('checked', true);

"<p>What are the differences of an Array and a Hash PHP? </p>

<p>An array： <code>array(1,2,3...)</code><br>
A hash： <code>array(key1=value1, key2=value2, ...)</code></p>

<p>are they different or the same? </p>

<p>※ For example, will the function arguments allows array  be effective for the hash? </p>

<p>Because I distinguish it by the conventional language and used it, I am puzzled.</p>
","16417","","<p>Both the things you are describing are arrays. The only difference between the two is that you are explicitly setting the keys for the second one, and as such they are known as <a href=""http://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.array.php"">associative arrays</a>. I do not know where you got the Hash terminology from (Perl?) but that's not what they are referred as in PHP.</p>

<p>So, for example, if you were to do this:</p>

<pre><code>$foo = array(1,2,3,4,5);
print_r($foo);
</code></pre>

<p>The output would be:</p>

<pre><code>Array
(
    [0] =&gt; 1
    [1] =&gt; 2
    [2] =&gt; 3
    [3] =&gt; 4
    [4] =&gt; 5
)
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, the keys to access the individual values you put in were created for you, but are there nonetheless. So this array is, essentially, associative as well. The other ""type"" of array is exactly the same way, except you are explcitily saying ""I want to access <em>this</em> value with <em>this</em> key"" instead of automatic numeric indexes (although the key you provide could also be numeric).</p>

<pre><code>$bar = array('uno' =&gt; 'one', 'dos' =&gt; 'two');
print_r($bar);
</code></pre>

<p>Would output:</p>

<pre><code>Array
(
    [uno] =&gt; one
    [dos] =&gt; two
)
</code></pre>

<p>As you might then expect, doing <code>print $bar['one']</code> would output <code>uno</code>, and doing <code>$foo[0]</code> from the first example would output <code>1</code>.</p>

<p>As far as functions go, PHP functions will most of the time take either one of these ""types"" of array and do what you want them to, but there are distinctions to be aware of, as some functions will do funky stuff to your indexes and some won't. It is usually best to read the documentation before using an array function, as it will note what the output will be depending on the keys of the array.</p>

<p>Looking at your regular expression I can't really tell if this is exactly what you wanted to do, but whatever it is you want to do, using a library like BeautifulSoup is much, much, better than trying to patch a regular expression together. I highly recommend going this route if possible.</p>

"<p>I'm building a web application with Django. The reasons I chose Django were:</p>

<ul>
<li>I wanted to work with free/open-source tools.</li>
<li>I like Python and feel it's a ""long term"" language, whereas regarding Ruby I wasn't sure, and PHP seemed like a huge hassle to learn.</li>
<li>I'm building a prototype for an idea and wasn't thinking too much about the future. Development speed was the main factor, and I already knew Python.</li>
<li>I knew the migration to Google App Engine would be easier should I choose to do so in the future.</li>
<li>I heard Django was ""nice"".</li>
</ul>

<p>Now that I'm getting closer to thinking about publishing my work, I start being concerned about scale. The only information I found about the scaling capabilities of Django is provided by the Django team (I'm not saying anything to disregard them, but this is clearly not objective information...).</p>

<p>My questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>What's the ""largest"" site that's built on Django today? (I measure size mostly by user traffic)</li>
<li>Can Django deal with 100,000 users daily, each visiting the site for a couple of hours?</li>
<li>Could a site like Stack Overflow run on Django?</li>
</ul>

"<p>When a user inserts data into a form and then submits it, it goes to my php script and inserts the data. The script will return a value letting the user know if the data was inserted or not. Since I am using JQuery, I have no idea how to do this. Can someone please point me in the right direction? All I'm after here is a nice, neat little 200px by 25px container that will fade in and the user MUST click it to acknowledge it.</p>

<p>Now that I think about it, since users are not the brightest lights in the harbor, it would be really cool if I could not only show then this css box letting them know if the insert was successful but also show them the customer that was inserted in case they forgot where they left off.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
","16417","","<p>I'm not going to mark this as a duplicate, but you are essentially asking the best way to show notifications using jQuery. And that has been <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/770038/best-ways-to-display-notifications-with-jquery"">asked before</a>. In a nutshell, in your basic setup all you need to do is show a div and fade it in, but there are a lot of plugins out there that handle more situations.</p>

<p>As far as showing them the customer that was inserted or whatever, all you have to do is return a JSON response from the server and handle it with the success callback of your AJAX request. You will have access to the data passed back from the server then.</p>

<p>To explain a little further: What you seem to be asking to do is how to send a request to a server using Ajax, get a notification that everything went as expected, and then show a notification in the webpage depending on what happened. If that is correct, I'm going to move on with these assumptions.</p>

<p>Let's put together a simple form to add a new customer to a fictional website. It might look like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form action='add_customer.php' method='POST' id='add_customer_form'&gt;
    First Name: &lt;input type='text' name='first_name'&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    Last Name: &lt;input type='text' name='last_name'&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    Email: &lt;input type='text' name='email'&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;input type='submit' value='Add Customer'&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now, our <strong>naive, insecure</strong> PHP code to handle this form submission (through AJAX) might look something like this. I say naive and insecure because you would do more data validation (as you <em>never</em> trust anything coming from the client) and would certainly need to clean the data to prevent SQL injections. This is an example, however, so it might look like this:</p>

<pre><code>$first_name = $_POST['first_name'];
$last_name = $_POST['last_name'];
$email = $_POST['email'];
if(mysql_query(""
    INSERT INTO customers
    (first_name, last_name, email)
    VALUES 
    ('$first_name','$last_name','$email')
   "")) {
    $success = 1;
    $message = 'Customer ' . $first_name . ' successfully added!';
} else {
    $success = 0;
    $message = 'Something went wrong while adding the customer!';
}
print json_encode(array('success' =&gt; $success, 'message' =&gt; $message));
</code></pre>

<p>We might then handle the sending of this form and the receiving of data from the server, using jQuery, with code that looks a little something like this:</p>

<pre><code>$(function() {
    $('#add_customer_form').submit(function() { // handle form submit
        var data = $(this).serialize(); // get form's data
        var url = $(this).attr('action'); // get form's action
        var method = $(this).attr('method'); // get form's method
        $.ajax({
            url: url, // where is this being sent to?
            type: method, // we're performing a POST
            data: data, // we're sending the form data
            dataType: 'json', // what will the server send back?
            success: function(data) { // the request succeeded, now what?
                // here data is a JSON object we received from the server
                // data.success will be 0 if something went wrong
                // and 1 if everything went well. data.message will have
                // the message we want to display to the user
                // at this point you would use one of the techniques I linked
                // to in order to display a fancy notification

                // the line below will dynamically create a new div element,
                // give it an ID of ""message"" (presumably for CSS purposes)
                // and insert the message returned by the server inside of it
                var $div = $('&lt;div&gt;').attr('id', 'message').html(data.message);

                if(data.success == 0) {
                    $div.addClass('error'); // to personalize the type of error
                } else {
                    $div.addClass('success'); // to personalize the type of error
                }
                $('body').append($div); // add the div to the document
            }
        });
        return false; // prevent non-ajax form submission.
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>I haven't tested any of this code but the idea is there. You return a format, JSON, from the server, with data, and handle the success callback jQuery fires when the request is complete, and add an element to your document you can style however you want (and show with things like <code>fadeIn()</code> if you want) with a message describing what happened. You might also need to catch the error callback (which fires if your server doesn't respond for whatever reason) and firing off another alert in that situation.</p>

"<p>I am somewhat new to Javascript but even more green with jQuery. I've already come across something that's got me scratching my head.</p>

<p>What is the difference between:</p>

<pre><code>$('.foo').click(function(){
//blah
});
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>$('.foo').onclick = function(){
//blah
}
</code></pre>

<p>I prefer the second way but it doesn't seem to work. Am I doing something wrong?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
","16417","","<p>You are missing the whole point of jQuery. Your preferred method doesn't work with jQuery because jQuery doesn't operate on single DOM elements. A single DOM element has an onclick property, so if you did something like this it would work:</p>

<pre><code>document.getElementById('bar').onclick = function() { // blah };
</code></pre>

<p>However, jQuery is all about <em>sets</em>. For example, in the code you pasted, you are trying to bind something to all elements with a class of <code>foo</code>. When doing stuff like this, you have to play by jQuery's rules (and this is a Good Thing!). A wrapped set, ie, <code>$('.foo')</code> is <em>not</em> the same as directly getting a DOM element like I did above. It <em>will</em>, however, contain an array of all the DOM elements found, which jQuery exposes. So if there was a single element with a class of <code>foo</code> in the document, you <em>could</em> do:</p>

<pre><code>$('.foo')[0].onclick = function() { // blah };
</code></pre>

<p>This is, however, not recommended as the whole point of jQuery is to abstract out all this specific Javascript syntax and let jQuery figure things out for you. You should embrace this, as it will make your code much cleaner and portable. As such, you should use the <code>click</code> or the <code>bind</code> functions:</p>

<pre><code>$('.foo').click(function() {
    // will bind something to all elements with a class of foo
});

$('.foo').bind('click', function() {
    // functionally identical to the above, either is fine
});

"<p>I'm a jQuery newbie, and I have trouble with a little script I created.</p>

<p>First of all, I have a table with 5 default rows. These are sortable, using a plugin called ""Table Drag'n'Drop"". A column in that table consists of a linked X which removes the table row when clicked.</p>

<p>The table looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;table id=""tracks""&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Title&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;File&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr class=""track""&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;input type=""text"" /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;input type=""file"" /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>tr.track</code> repeats itself five times in the code. These are perfectly draggable and removable by clicking the X.</p>

<p>This is the jQuery code:</p>

<pre><code>// makes the table sortable
$(""#tracks"").tableDnD();

// adds more rows (just a link)
$(""#addRow"").click(function() {
    newTrack = 'same code as tr.track'
    $(""tbody"").append(newTrack);
    return false;
});

// delete rows
$(""a.deleteme"").click(function() {
    $(this).parents(""tr.track"").fadeOut(""fast"", function() {
        $(this).remove();
        return false;
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>When I add a new table row, this row won't let it sort or be removed by clicking the X. Seems like the jQuery doesn't notices it's there?</p>
","16417","","<p>You need to use <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Events/live#typefn"" rel=""nofollow""><code>live</code></a>:</p>

<blockquote>

</code></pre>

<p>With this, using <code>live</code> instead:</p>

<pre><code>$(""a.deleteme"").live('click', function() {
</code></pre>

<h3>Edit:</h3>

<p>As far as the sorting, apparently the plugin you are using is not taking advantange of <code>live</code> internally. The only solution is then to call the init code again after you add a new table row. You can do this fine with some plugins and some others don't handle it nicely. Let us know how it goes.

<p>If I am right, what you are essentially asking is how you can make this piece of code work for multiple forms without having to edit the selector. This is very easy. As long as you have the above code included in every page with a form, you can change the <code>$('#add_customer_form')</code> part to something like <code>$('form.json_response')</code>. With this selector we are basically telling jQuery ""any form with a class of <code>json_response</code> should be handled through this submit function"" - The specific class I'm using is not relevant here, the point is you use a class and give it to all the forms that should have the functionality. Remember, jQuery works on <em>sets</em> of objects. The way I originally had it the set happened to be 1 element, but every jQuery function is meant to act upon as many elements as it matches. This way, whenever you create a form you want to handle through AJAX (and you know the server will return a JSON response with a success indicator), you can simply add whatever class you choose and the jQuery code will take over and handle it for you.</p>

<p>There is also a <a href=""http://malsup.com/jquery/form/"" rel=""nofollow"">cleaner plugin</a> that sort of does this, but the above is fine too.</p>

<p>Sometimes geting the concepts of the language is harder than working with it.</p>
","16417","","<p>Your question is really rather broad as classes and instances/objects are vital parts of object-oriented programming, so this is not really Python specific. I recommend you buy some books on this as, while initially basic, it can get pretty in-depth. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class-based%5Fprogramming"" rel=""nofollow"">In essense</a>, however:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The most popular and developed model of OOP is a class-based model, as opposed to an object-based model. In this model, objects are entities that combine state (i.e., data), behavior (i.e., procedures, or methods) and identity (unique existence among all other objects). The structure and behavior of an object are defined by a class, which is a definition, or blueprint, of all objects of a specific type. An object must be explicitly created based on a class and an object thus created is considered to be an instance of that class. An object is similar to a structure, with the addition of method pointers, member access control, and an implicit data member which locates instances of the class (i.e. actual objects of that class) in the class hierarchy (essential for runtime inheritance features).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you would, for example, define a <code>Dog</code> class, and create instances of particular dogs:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; class Dog():
...     def __init__(self, name, breed):
...             self.name = name
...             self.breed = breed
...     def talk(self):
...             print ""Hi, my name is "" + self.name + "", I am a "" + self.breed
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; skip = Dog('Skip','Bulldog')
&gt;&gt;&gt; spot = Dog('Spot','Dalmatian')
&gt;&gt;&gt; spot.talk()
Hi, my name is Spot, I am a Dalmatian
&gt;&gt;&gt; skip.talk()
Hi, my name is Skip, I am a Bulldog
</code></pre>

<p>While this example is silly, you can then start seeing how you might define a <code>Client</code> class that sets a blueprint for what a Client is, has methods to perform actions on a particular client, then manipulate a particular <em>instance</em> of a client by creating an object and calling these methods in that context.</p>

<p>Sometimes, however, you have methods of a class that don't really make sense being accessed through an instance of the class, but more from the class itself. These are known as <a href=""http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#staticmethod"" rel=""nofollow"">static methods</a>. </p>

"<p>I just wrote a $().bind('event') function and then got concerned that this kind of a call might be very expensive if jQuery has to run through each element in the DOM to bind this event.</p>

<p>Or maybe, it's just about as efficient as an event could be. The jQuery docs I've read aren't making this clear. Any opinions?</p>
","16417","","<p>There are two things that can make your event binding code slow: the selector and the # of bindings. The most critical of the two is the # of bindings, but the selector could impact your initial performance.</p>

<p>As far as selectors go, just make sure you don't use pure class name selectors like <code>.myclass</code>. If you know that the class of <code>myclass</code> will always be in a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element, make your selector be <code>div.myclass</code> as it will help jQuery find the matching elements faster. Also, don't take advantange of jQuery letting you give it huge selector strings. Everything it can do with string selectors it can also do through functions, and this is intentional, as it is (marginally, admittedly) faster to do it this way as jQuery doesn't have to sit around to parse your string to figure out what you want. So instead of doing <code>$('#myform input:eq(2)');</code> you might do <code>$('input','#myform').eq(2);</code>. By specifying a context, we are also not making jQuery look anywhere it doesn't have to, which is much faster. <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/879123/what-is-the-most-efficient-way-to-access-dom-elements-in-jquery"">More on this here</a>.</p>

<p>As far as the amount of bindings: if you have a relatively medium-sized amount of elements then you should be fine - anything up to 200, 300 potential element matches will perform fine in modern browsers. If you have more than this you might want to instead look into Event Delegation.</p>

<p>What is Event Delegation? Essentially, when you run code like this:</p>

<pre><code>$('div.test').click(function() {
    doSomething($(this));
});
</code></pre>

<p>jQuery is doing something like this behind the scenes (binding an event for each matched element):</p>

<pre><code>$('div.test').each(function() {
    this.addEventListener('click', function() {
        doSomething(this);
    }, false);
});
</code></pre>

<p>This can get inefficient if you have a large amount of elements. With event delegation, you can cut down the amount of bindings done down to one. But how? The event object has a <code>target</code> property that lets you know what element the event acted on. So you could then do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).click(function(e) {
    var $target = $(e.target);
    if($target.is('div.test')) { // the element clicked on is a DIV
                                 // with a class of test
       doSomething($target);
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>Thankfully you don't actually have to code the above with jQuery. The <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Events/live#typefn"">live</a> function, which is advertised as an easy way to bind events to elements that do not yet exist, is actually able to do this by using event delegation and checking at the time an action occurs if the target matches the selector you specify to it. This has the side effect, of course, of being very handy when speed is important.</p>

<p>The moral of the story? If you are concerned about the amount of bindings your script has just replace <code>.bind</code> with <code>.live</code> and make sure you have smart selectors.</p>

<p>Do note, however, that not all events are supported by <code>.live</code>. If you need something not supported by it, you can check out the <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/livequery"">livequery</a> plugin, which is live on steroids.</p>

        return $(this).text().toLowerCase() == search;

<blockquote>
  <p>Table rows may be grouped into a table head, table foot, and one or more table body sections, using the THEAD, TFOOT and TBODY elements, respectively. This division enables user agents to support scrolling of table bodies independently of the table head and foot. When long tables are printed, the table head and foot information may be repeated on each page that contains table data.</p>
  
  <p>The table head and table foot should contain information about the table's columns. The table body should contain rows of table data.</p>
  
  <p>When present, each THEAD, TFOOT, and TBODY contains a row group. Each row group must contain at least one row, defined by the TR element.</p>

<p>I am trying to write a Python script that will read this file (fread) and [eventually] create a MYSSQL ready .sql file with insert statements.</p>

<p>A line in the file I'm reading looks something like:</p>

<pre><code>1    John Smith    Developer  http://twiiter.com/johns   Chicago, IL
</code></pre>

<p>My Python script so far:</p>

<pre><code>import sys

fwrite = open('d:/icm_db/wp_sql/wp.users.sql','w')

fread = open('d:/icm_db/users.txt','r')

for line in fread:
    print line;


fread.close()
fwrite.close()

<p>How can I ""implode"" each line so I can access each column and do business on it?</p>

<p>I need to generate multiple MYSQL insert statements per line I read. So... for each line read, I'd generate something like:</p>

<pre><code>INSERT INTO `wp_users` (`ID`, `user_login`, `user_name`) 
VALUES (line[0], 'line[2]', 'line[3]');

...
['1', 'John Smith', 'Developer', 'http://twiiter.com/johns', 'Chicago, IL']
['2', 'John Doe', 'Developer', 'http://whatever.com', 'Tallahassee, FL']

"<p>Similar to what Facebook does on its newsfeed, I want to allow commenting on numerous feed items, which I'm pulling via a php foreach statement.  This is creating identical classes.  So when I click .show_comments it activates everything.</p>

<p>I went through SO and found something akin to what you see below...but it's not working for me.</p>

<p>How do I target individual .show_comments to animate and toggle the selected item?</p>

<pre><code>$j(function() {
    $j(this).find('.show_comments').click(function(){
	    $j(this).find('.comments').slideDown(""fast"");

","16417","","<p><strong>IDs should be unique in a HTML document.</strong> If you have several elements with <code>id=""show_comments""</code> you are doing it wrong and you won't be able to access more than 1 of them through Javascript. The proper way of grouping elements is by classes.</p>

<p>The right way of doing it would then be something like this, assuming the HTML looks like the following:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""item-1""&gt;
....text of whatever people are commenting on....
  &lt;a href='#' class='toggle_comments'&gt;show comments&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;div class='comments' style='display: none;'&gt;

  &lt;div class='comments' style='display: none;'&gt;
  ... comments ...
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<p>And the Javascript/jQuery would then be:</p>

<pre><code>$('a.toggle_comments').toggle(function() {
    $(this).next('div.comments').slideDown('fast');

","16417","","<p>The vast majority of the time you are much better off to use a native function that has been optimized over whatever solution you come up with.

		    	return;

		    form.submit();
		break;

","16417","","<p>There are two variants of the submit function. If you call <code>$('#rpt').submit();</code> you are firing the ""submit"" event of the form. If you call <code>$('#rpt').submit(myFunctionName);</code> You are binding <code>myFunctionName</code> to the ""submit"" event of the form. This <em>will not</em> be fired when the page loads, but only when you try to submit the form. As such, this code:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form id=""rpt"" method=""GET"" action=""http://www.google.com/search""&gt;

<h1>EDIT</h1>

<p>Ok, so I whipped up a working example of what you are trying to do. At first I was annoyed you couldn't get this to work, but there were actually quite a number of limitations you have to work around because of how crappy this editor is. Anyways, onto the explanation:</p>

<p>The first problem is that the library overrides the use of $ to its own little function. So the jQuery awesomeness is not possible the regular way. Thankfully, <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Core/jQuery.noConflict"" rel=""nofollow"">jQuery is awesome</a> and you can get around that by doing something like this:</p>

<pre><code>$j = jQuery.noConflict();
</code></pre>

<p>Now instead of doing <code>$(...);</code> you have to do <code>$j(...);</code>. If you are not aware of this it is likely you were trying to write jQuery code and nothing was happening.</p>

<p>The next hurdle you were probably having is that for <em>most</em> events, when you do something like <code>$(selector).myevent(aFunction);</code> it is assumed that doing <code>$(selector).myevent();</code> will fire said event. However, <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/645555/should-jquerys-form-submit-not-trigger-onsubmit-within-the-form-tag"">this is not true of the submit event</a>. Unless the form action is <em>triggered by a user</em> the code you bind to the submit of a form won't be called when the form is submitted by code. So even though the line in the source code of the editor that does <code>form.submit();</code> is simply firing the native submit event of the form, even if you bind an event to this event with Javascript it won't be called in this circumstance because the user didn't trigger the submit event, code did.</p>

<p>Due to this limitation, it gets increasingly tricky to achieve what you want without editing the source code of the editor. You see, the editor attaches its ""create all the dashboard crap"" stuff to the window's load event. This event fires after jQuery's DOM ready event, as the whole point of jQuery's ready is to fire as soon as possible and not a second later, while <code>window.load</code> takes its sweet time. So what we have to do is ditch the jQuery bind code (<em>grimace</em>) and use the editor's own binding code to attach an event directly afterwards its own ""create the dashboard"" function. At this point, the dashboard has already be"

<p>getJson uses XMLHttpRequest which (I believe) has both synchronous and asynchronous behaviors, can I use the synchronouse behavior?</p>
","16417","","<p>Looking at the jQuery source code, this is all <code>$.getJSON</code> does:</p>

<p>Thank you! :)</p>
","16417","","<p>Well, are these three main categories set in stone? Is there a possibility of a fourth one cropping up in the future? I would probably go with something like this:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE property (

    value varchar(250) not null,
    primary key(id)
);

<p>I think this would be the most effective in the long run and the most flexible if - when - the time comes.</p>

 s ON f.feature = s.id WHERE f.property = 1;

My specific situation is the following:</p>

<p>I have a list of users lined out in the html page. On each of these users i can do the following: change their 'status' or 'remove' them from the account.</p>

<p>What's a good practice for storing information in the page about the following:</p>

","16417","","<p>There is a lot of debate as to what is best to use. You can store the data a lot of ways, and they all make someone happy - custom attributes will of course not validate if you use XHTML, and using classes to store one or two bits of data is clumsy at best and only gets worse with the amount of things you want to know. Personally, not only am I not a big fan of XHTML,  I am also not much of a validation nazi, so I recommend going with the custom attributes.</p>

<p>There is, however, an option that reconciles custom attributes with standards: <code>data-</code> attributes. As John Resig (the author of jQuery) <a href=""http://ejohn.org/blog/html-5-data-attributes/"" rel=""nofollow"">writes about in his blog</a>, this is a new attribute being introduced in HTML5 that allows you to specify <a href=""http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#custom-data-attribute"" rel=""nofollow"">custom data attributes</a> with the <code>data-</code> prefix. So a perfectly valid element might look like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li data-userid='5' data-status='active'&gt;Paolo Bergantino&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This has the upside that while you are still using custom attributes which <em>may</em> be bad if you are using XHTML, your code is going to age very well as this is the way that we will be storing data related to a particular item in the future. </p>

"<p>Say you have a webpage with following sample code:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;tr class=""even""&gt;

	&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;something3.1&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

<p>These are not in a loop so I have to explicitly say 'even' 'odd'.  Later on if we decide to add a new row between something2 and something3 then we need to change 'even' 'odd' for rest of the rows as well. </p>

<p>Is there way in css to do this automatically in IE6?</p>

<p>Currently this is my css code for even </p>

<pre><code>.headerTable tr.even {
    font-weight : bold;
    font-size : 9pt;
    font-family : Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif,Verdana,Geneva;
    background-color: #FFFFFF;
    height: 20px;
    color: #000000;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I already had jQuery</p>
","16417","","<p>The way to do this would be to use the nth-child(even) and (odd) rules. Unfortunately, and this should come as no surprise, IE6 does not support this. So you have a few options:</p>

<p>A) Use Javascript, with the obvious drawback of it not working for people with JS disabled:</p>

<pre><code>var rows = document.getElementById('mytable').getElementsByTagName('tr');
for(var x = 0; x &lt; rows.length; x++) {
    rows[x].className = (x % 2 == 0) ? 'even' : 'odd';
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you expect to need more dynamic client side behavior on your application, you could then check a library like jQuery out. For <em>just this</em> it is unnecessary, but it makes working with Javascript across browsers a breeze. You would do the above with jQuery like it is shown in <a href=""#936093"">this answer</a>.</p>

<p>Depending on your audience, Javascript may be perfectly acceptable. If it's not, then maybe you can...</p>

<p>B) Simplify your CSS and keep doing it manually. You can only mark the odd rows with a class, and then make the row default style the even styling. This will save you some work when moving things around.</p>

<p>C) Generate the rows programmatically. It is really archaic to be entering data like that into a fixed table if you're going to be updating it often enough that this is a problem. I'm obviously oblivious to your circumstance, but it should be trivial to do this in a loop somehow with a simple language like PHP.</p>

<p>D) Stop using a really outdated browser. :) (This is only half joking, as I'm sure its out of your control)</p>

<p>How do I do this?</p>
","16417","","<p>I am completely ignorant of the ASP.NET side of it, but as far as jQuery and Javascript....</p>

<p>To get the value of a text field, you use the jQuery function <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Attributes/val"" rel=""nofollow""><code>val()</code></a>:</p>

<pre><code>var value = $('#mytextbox').val();
</code></pre>

<p>To turn a string to lower case, you use the string method <a href=""http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref%5FtoLowerCase.asp"" rel=""nofollow""><code>toLowerCase()</code></a>:</p>

<pre><code>var value = $('#mytextbox').val().toLowerCase();
</code></pre>

<p>Since <code>val()</code> returns a string we can throw that at the end.</p>

<p>To check if a string is within another string, you use the string method <a href=""http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref%5FIndexOf.asp"" rel=""nofollow""><code>indexOf()</code></a>:</p>

<pre><code>var needle = 'Hello';
var haystack = 'Hello World';

<p>And maybe I'm going about this all wrong.  I thought about a method with a switch statement, pass in burrito or taco, then call the right method from there.

<blockquote>
  <p>Always use quotes around a string literal array index. For example, $foo['bar'] is correct, while $foo[bar] is not.</p>
  
  <p>This is wrong, but it works. The reason is that this code has an undefined constant (bar) rather than a string ('bar' - notice the quotes). PHP may in future define constants which, unfortunately for such code, have the same name. It works because PHP automatically converts a bare string (an unquoted string which does not correspond to any known symbol) into a string which contains the bare string. For instance, if there is no defined constant named bar, then PHP will substitute in the string 'bar' and use that.</p>

"
"<p>Imagine a user has just posted data to your web application and you want to re-display the current page with a message about their success or failure.  This gets complicated.</p>

<p>If the data is valid and the user is expecting html, you want to issue a redirect so that refreshing doesn't cause them to re-post.  You want to redirect to the referer, if it exists, and display a message.  If they are not expecting html, you can simply return 200 OK.</p>

<p>If the data is invalid and the user is expecting html, you want to re-render the page they came from, with a visible error, so that they can re-post.  To do this, you'd have to run the previous action, and make it aware of the error message.  To decide which was the previous action, perhaps you included that as a hidden parameter in the form.  If they are not expecting html, you can return an applicable 4xx client error. </p>

<p>I find myself doing this silly dance far too many times.  So the questions are:</p>

<p>1) How would you abstract this whole process so that any form post can take advantage of it?</p>

<p>2) What's the most maintainable or least repetitive way to achieve this in your favorite web framework?</p>

<p>3) Is there anything you would change to this whole process that would make it simpler?  </p>

<p>Idea 1: Never render on a post, always redirect.  Stuff the error data in the session for a split second between requests, and then clear it, just like the success message.  That way, valid and invalid posts can be handled the same way.</p>

<p>Idea 2: Don't do any normal HTTP posts.  Only use ajax.  Now you don't have to worry about rendering or redirecting at all.  This would only be useful if you have an ajax-heavy application already.</p>
","16417","","<p>Idea 2 is out the window. That's a horrible idea and not necessary at all. AJAX is nice, but don't overdo it. Not to mention - what about that chunk of users with Javascript disabled?</p>

<p>I think what you're thinking about (without really knowing it) is the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post/Redirect/Get"" rel=""nofollow"">Post/Redirect/Get</a> pattern. It is the best practice when it comes to this, and you should follow it. Basically, as you said, you <em>never</em> respond to a POST by anything other than a redirect. As far as notifications, most of the time you <em>know</em> where they're coming from because of the particular action. If you don't, the HTTP REFERER is a decent alternative. Yes it can be disabled, but that's ~1% of your users, if that. As far as notifications, sessions are perfect for this. Just store the code and message in the current session and make your template aware of them. Print out the message if it exists and delete the session variables.</p>

<p>I'm dynamically sending the field values to mysql when a blur event occurs. However, when this field is inserted, it doesn't recognise and the blur event isn't picking up when any value has been entered on the new fields. Is this due to the original blur event handler being set up on document ready?</p>

<p>How do I get the mysql update jquery code to recognise when the extra form fields are made visible after the document ready initialisation has already been completed? I've tried various events based on the div id but to no avail.....</p>
","16417","","<p>The reason your code is not working for the dynamically added inputs is because when you do something like:</p>

<pre><code>$(selector).blur(myFunction);
</code></pre>

<p>jQuery goes through every element that matches <code>selector</code> <em>at that point</em> and adds an event handler that runs <code>myFunction</code> when the <code>blur</code> event is fired happens on the element. This means that any elements that match <code>selector</code> added <em>after</em> this line of code runs will not have been bound.</p>

<p>To get around this problem, jQuery introduced the live function in 1.3. As the documentation reads:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Binds a handler to an event (like click) for all current - and future - matched element. Can also bind custom events.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately, as of right now jQuery does not support the <code>blur</code> event with the <code>live</code> function.</p>

<p>Your options then are:</p>

<p>A) Run the binding code everytime you add new inputs.<br />
B) Use the <a href=""http://plugins.jquery.com/project/livequery"" rel=""nofollow"">livequery</a> plugin, which is that <code>live</code> is based off of and does support blur.  </p>

<p>Personally, I would go with A.</p>

"<p>i have a jquery function that when clicked produces a set timeout on making a div visible.</p>

<p>however, if another option is selected during the settimeout length, i would like to know how to destroy this function and stoop anything else in it happening.</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function(){

$('li#contact').click(function() {
		$('ul.image_display').css('display', 'none');
		$('ul.projects').fadeOut().hide();
		$('li#cv').removeClass('cur');
		$('li#projects').removeClass('cur');
		$('li#contact').addClass('cur');
		$('ul.contact').fadeIn(function()
						{
						setTimeout( function()
					    {
						$('ul.contact').fadeOut('slow');
						}, 8000);
						});
		setTimeout(function() {
			$('li#contact').removeClass('cur');
			$('li#cv').addClass('cur');
			$('ul.projects').fadeIn('slow');
			$('ul.image_display').css('display', 'block');
			}, 8625);

});

		$('li#cv').removeClass('cur');
		$('ul.contact').fadeOut().hide();

		$('ul.projects').fadeIn('slow');
		$('#projects').addClass('cur');
		$('ul.image_display').css('display', 'block');
});

});

<p>if the second is clicked just after the first than class 'cur' still comes up on li#cv after the set time.</p>

<p>Hope so!</p>
","16417","","<p>The <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Window.setTimeout""><code>setTimeout</code></a> function returns an identifier to that timeout. You can then cancel that timeout with the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.clearTimeout""><code>clearTimeout</code></a> function. So you can do something like this (fill in the blanks with your code):</p>

<pre><code>var timer;

    $(...).click(function() {
        clearTimeout(timer);
    });
});

<p>It's not particularly super clean to keep a global variable for this, however. You could store the timer in the <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Data""><code>data</code></a> attribute of whatever element makes the most sense for your situation. Something like this:</p>

<pre><code>$(function() {
    $(...).click(function() {
        ...
        var timer = setTimeout(...);
        $(someelement).data('activetimer', timer);
        ...

    $(...).click(function() {
        var timer = $(someelement).data('activetimer');
        if(timer) {
            clearTimeout(timer);
            $(someelement).removeData('activetimer');
        }
    });

            }
        });
        return false; // important: prevent the form from submitting
    });

<p>The reason I got rid of the <code>onsubmit</code> code is because it is considered bad practice to have inline JavaScript like that. You should strive to make your forms free of JavaScript and then bind all the JavaScript away from it. This is known as unobtrusive JavaScript and it is a Good Thing.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:</p>

<p>Since you have that code in many pages, this is a function that will do what you want using the same signature you currently have on the post function. I recommend you take a few hours to update all your forms over keeping this, but here it is anyways:</p>

<pre><code>function post(div,url,formId) {
    $.post(url, $('#' + formId).serialize(), function(d) {

    });
}

<p>As far as your problem, the <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/livequery"">livequery</a> plugin could help you there. Alternatively, it is as simple as encapsulating the binding code in a function and calling it whenever a form is added.</p>

<p>Anyhow, with that in mind, this should do it:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form id='myform' action='jquery.php' method='GET'&gt;
    &lt;input type='submit' id='btn1' value='Normal Submit'&gt;
    &lt;input type='button' id='btn2' value='New Window'&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>With this javascript:</p>

<pre><code>var form = document.getElementById('myform');
form.onsubmit = function() {
    form.target = '_self';
};

document.getElementById('btn2').onclick = function() {
    form.target = '_blank';
    form.submit();
}

"<p>I saw <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/943795/difference-between-and"">this question</a> and I am wondering about the same thing in JavaScript.</p>

<p>If you use the character ' or the character "" when making strings in JavaScript, the application seems to behave the same. So what is the difference between these two characters?</p>

<p>The only advantage I have seen in using ' to build strings is that I can do stuff like:</p>

<pre><code>var toAppend = '&lt;div id=""myDiv1""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;';
</code></pre>

<p>Instead of:</p>

<pre><code>var toAppend = ""&lt;div id=\""myDiv1\""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;"";
</code></pre>

<p>Is there any significant difference between them that I should be aware of?</p>
","16417","","<p>They are equivalent for all intents and purposes. If you want to use either one inside a string, it is a good idea to use the other one to create the string, as you noted. Other than that, it's all the same.</p>

","16417","","<p>You have to realize that a lot of JavaScript is event based. Here is what is happening:</p>

<p><code>GDownloadUrl</code> takes a callback. The second argument is a function that will be called <em>when the request is complete</em>. It <strong>will not</strong> be called right away. This is important. After you close the call to <code>GDownloadUrl</code>, Javascript keeps on going. It doesn't wait for the request to complete. As a matter of fact, if you leave both alerts in you will see that the alert 2 will fire before alert 1. As such, if you want to do a particular thing with these variables once they are fetched, you should move that code to a function and call it from within the <code>GDownloadUrl</code> callback. This is just the way JavaScript works and you'll get used to it.</p>

","16417","","<p>This is how jQuery does it internally:</p>

<pre><code>$(""&lt;div/&gt;"").append(loadeddata).find('#mydiv');

<p>If you expect to have SCRIPT tags in the HTML, you should throw this in to avoid any 'Permission Denied' errors in IE:</p>

<pre><code>$(""&lt;div/&gt;"").append(loadeddata.replace(/&lt;script(.|\s)*?\/script&gt;/g, """")).find('#mydiv');

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:</p>

<p>You are missing the point of what is supposed to be happening. </p>

<p>By doing <code>$(""&lt;div/&gt;"").append(...);</code> jQuery creates a dummy <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and gets the browser to parse the HTML by inserting it inside of the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>. Once that's done, we can find the DIV we want, and return the HTML. So the more proper code sample I should have put above looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>var html = $(""&lt;div/&gt;"").append(loadeddata).find('#mydiv').html();
$('#whereIwantIt').html(html);

"<p>Python's list type has an index() method that takes one parameter and returns the index of the first item in the list matching the parameter.  For instance:</p>

&gt;&gt;&gt; some_list.index(""pear"")

<p>getIndexOfTuple() is just a hypothetical method that accepts a sub-index and a value, and then returns the index of the list item with the given value at that sub-index.  I hope</p>

<p>Is there some way to achieve that general result, using list comprehensions or lambas or something ""in-line"" like that?  I think I could write my own class and method, but I don't want to reinvent the wheel if Python already has a way to do it.</p>

"<p>I'm developing sites using progressive enhancement implemented completely in jQuery.</p>

<p>However, if the user clicks on them while the page is loading, they still get the non-enhanced version.</p>

","16417","","<p>I haven't tested this, but you could try <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Events/live"" rel=""nofollow""><code>live</code></a>. The thinking is that you could put your click handlers outside of document.ready so they get executed right away. Since <code>live</code> uses <a href=""http://www.sitepoint.com/blogs/2008/07/23/javascript-event-delegation-is-easier-than-you-think/"" rel=""nofollow"">event delegation</a> to achieve it's functionality, you don't really need to wait for the DOM to be ready, and any clicks that are made while the page is loading should still be captured by the event handler.</p>

<p>If that doesn't work, you could try putting the Javascript script tags directly underneath whatever they need to bind. It's not pretty, but it will pretty much eliminate the problem.</p>

"<p>I am currently trying to find the parent of a parent of an element. I have a link being clicked that is in a <code>&lt;td&gt;</code>, and I'd like to get the <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code> object.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> It appears an error in my syntax was throwing the whole thing off. ""$(this).parent().parent()"" does in fact work, but I wound up going with $(this).closest('tr')"" because it seems like the most efficient solution.</p>
","16417","","<p>The best way would probably be using <code>closest</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$(this).closest('tr');
</code></pre>

<p><a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Traversing/closest"">Check out the documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Closest works by first looking at the current element to see if it matches the specified expression, if so it just returns the element itself. If it doesn't match then it will continue to traverse up the document, parent by parent, until an element is found that matches the specified expression. If no matching element is found then none will be returned.</p>

<p>In the jQuery documentation, what does ""event"" and ""ui"" represent and how can I use them?  </p>

<p>Is there any way to pass the specific .selector object itself into the function?</p>

<p>I guess I don't quite understand how this whole thing works without any examples.</p>

<p>I appreciate any help!</p>
","16417","","<p>When it comes to jQuery, you need to embrace looking things up in the documentation, as for the most part it is pretty complete and will give you anything you need.</p>

<p>With that in mind, this is the <a href=""http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/"" rel=""nofollow"">documentation</a>: on Draggables:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All callbacks (start,stop,resize) receive two arguments: The original browser event and a prepared ui object. The ui object has the following fields:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>ui.helper - the jQuery object representing the helper that's being dragged</li>
  <li>ui.position - current position of the helper as { top, left } object, relative to the offset element</li>
  <li>ui.offset - current absolute position of the helper as { top, left } object, relative to page</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>As far as the event object, <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Events/jQuery.Event"" rel=""nofollow"">here's the documentation for that</a>.</p>

<p>The most common usage of the event object is to prevent the default action. So if you have a link:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href=""more.html"" id=""show_more""&gt;Show me more!&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And you want something to happen when the user clicks on it and has Javascript enabled, you might do:</p>

<pre><code>$('#show_more').click(function(e) {
    alert('heya!');
});
</code></pre>

<p>The problem here is that after the alert shows up and you close it, the default action of the link (""go to another page"") is going to happen and the user will be sent to <code>more.html</code>. A lot of the time this isn't what you want, so you then prevent the default action:</p>

<pre><code>$('#show_more').click(function(e) {
    alert('heya!');
    e.preventDefault(); // cancel link event, could also return false;
});

","16417","","<p>What exactly do you mean by ""convert to jQuery code""? jQuery has really pretty much nothing to do with the code you posted. It is not a different language, it has no magic that will make the Javascript any different. jQuery is a library intended to make it easy to manipulate DOM elements and perform common Javascript tasks cross-browser. It <em>is</em> Javascript, and there's nowhere really where it would fit to have a function such as this one.</p>

<p>If what you really mean is ""make a plugin out of this"", then it's a 5 liner:</p>

<pre><code>$.fn.humanizeNumber = function() {
    return this.each(function() {
        $(this).html(CALLTHEFUNCTION($(this).html()));
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>Where <code>CALLTHEFUNCTION</code> is whatever is the main function of the code you posted above (I don't really care to go through it and find what it is). That plugin would then let you do this:</p>

<pre><code>$('#myelement').humanizeNumber();
</code></pre>

<p>To convert the value in <code>#myelement</code> from ""123"" to whatever your function returns.</p>

"<p>I am currently working on my portfolio website which uses a very simple navigation.
However what I want to do is have the drop shadow beneath the type become stronger (read: higher opacity/ darker) when the type is being hovered on.</p>

<p>Right now my code looks as follows and does not generate any errors but simply does not do anything either.</p>

<p>For a good understanding of what I mean please have a look at <a href=""http://portfolio.jannisgundermann.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">the website with a live example</a>.</p>

<pre><code>/* Work | Play | About | Contact */
/* Shadow Opacity */
$(document).ready(function() {
    $('#workShadow', '#playShadow', '#aboutShadow', '#contactShadow').fadeTo( 0, 0.1);
});

/* Shadow Hover effect */
$(document).ready(function() {
    $('a#work').hover(function() {
        $('#workShadow').fadeTo( 200, 0.5);
    }, function() {
        $('#workShadow').fadeTo( 400, 0.1);
    });
});

/* Type movement on hovering */
$(document).ready(function() {  
    $('a.shift').hover(function() { //mouse in  
        $(this).animate({ paddingTop: 85, paddingBottom: 2 }, 200);  
    }, function() { //mouse out  
        $(this).stop().animate({ paddingTop: 75, paddingBottom: 12 }, 400);  
    });  
});
</code></pre>

<p>Basically I need the opacity of the shadow elements (4 individual ones) to start at 10% opacity and while the user hovers, the type moves down (this part is working) and simultaneously the shadow becomes stronger, increases to 60% opacity. Then revert back to 10% when on mouseOut.</p>
","16417","","<p>This line is wrong - it is passing a bunch of arguments to the <code>$()</code> function.</p>

<pre><code>$('#workShadow', '#playShadow', '#aboutShadow', '#contactShadow').fadeTo( 0, 0.1);
</code></pre>

<p>As the <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Core/jQuery#expressioncontext"">documentation</a> notes, jQuery doesn't expect N arguments as a selector, but 1:</p>

<pre><code>$('#workShadow, #playShadow, #aboutShadow, #contactShadow').fadeTo( 0, 0.1);
</code></pre>

<p>It is common (and good) practice to give a set of objects that should do something a common class or to select them in a smarter than just listing all their IDs. Based on your current HTML, this selector gets all the shadow <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s in the menu, and is much shorter - you won't have to modify your code if you add a new menu element later on, for example:</p>

<pre><code>$('div','#navigationFrame').fadeTo(0, 0.1);
</code></pre>

<p>I also see you have this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;li id=""work""&gt;&lt;a id=""work"" ...&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This is really, really, wrong. IDs should be unique in the document. By having more than 1 ID in the document not only are you breaking best practices, ID selection on jQuery will go crazy and won't work as expected. Like the fadeTo selector, you can change the shadow changing code to a cleaner:</p>

<pre><code>$('a','#navigationFrame').hover(function() {
    $(this).next('div').fadeTo(200, 0.5);
}, function() {
    $(this).next('div').fadeTo(400, 0.1);
});

<p>I tested the website with these changes and it works fine.</p>

<p>What the selectors in my examples are doing is taking advantage of jQuery's <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Core/jQuery#expressioncontext"">context</a>. By doing this:</p>

<pre><code>$('a','#navigationFrame');
</code></pre>

<p>Or this:</p>

<pre><code>$('div','#navigationFrame');
</code></pre>

<p>We are telling jQuery ""only give me the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> (or <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>) elements inside <code>#navigationFrame</code>.</p>

<p>It is equivalent to this:</p>

<pre><code>$('#navigationFrame').find('a');
</code></pre>

<p>It is a good idea to take advantage of this. I see you have a tendency to manually list the elements you're trying to do stuff to do even if they are all similar in some way. Try to shake this habit and let jQuery's powerful selectors get what you want from the document.</p>

"<p>Hey, how can I say the following</p>

<p>Foreach  tag in my table, when someone clicks it I want to run a function</p>

<p>so something like:  </p>

<pre><code>ForEachTag.click  
(  
    function (e)   
    {  
    }  
)
</code></pre>
","16417","","<p>If you have a table like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;table id='test'&gt;

    &lt;td&gt;Hi&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=""#""&gt;test1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Hi&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The most basic selector is going to look like this:</p>

<pre><code>$('a').click(function(e) {
    alert('test!');
    return false;
});
</code></pre>

<p>This is simply binding something to <em>all</em> the links in the document. Want more control?</p>

<pre><code>$('#test').find('a').click(function(e) {
    alert('test!');
    return false;
});
</code></pre>

<p>Which is essentially saying: ""find me all the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> elements inside the element with id of <code>test</code> and bind this click handler to it"" - jQuery is so powerful because it handles sets of objects this way.</p>

<p>This is just the tip of the iceberg, though! You can get much more in-depth. What if you only want to bind the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> elements that appear in the 1st <code>&lt;td&gt;</code> relative to the <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code>? No problem:</p>

<pre><code>$('#test').find('td:nth-child(1) a').click(function(e) {
    alert('test');
    return false;
});
</code></pre>

<p>Although jQuery does have an <code>each</code> function that lets you iterate through a set of elements, when it comes to binding events you will rarely need it. jQuery loves sets and will do anything you ask it to to a set of elements if it makes any sense.</p>

"<p><em>After feedback, complete rewrite of the question.</em></p>

<p>I have the following mark up :</p>

<pre><code>&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;Title&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;bla&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;

<pre><code>  &lt;h1&gt;Title&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;bla&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    ... &lt;!-- a thousand tags --&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Using :</p>

<pre><code>$('body &gt; *:not(div#do-not-modify-me)');
</code></pre>

<p>I do that so I can get all the content of the body except the div with the id ""do-not-modify-me"".</p>

<p>Now, let's say that I want to build a function that let another programmer to select anything  in the body, just like the select with jquery. The other programmer should not modify div#do-not-modify-me, but he should not have to care about it neither.</p>

<p><code>$('body &gt; *:not(div#do-not-modify-me)')</code> will be called a lot of time, so we will cache it.</p>

<p>The <em>idea</em> is :</p>

<pre><code>// TEST CODE

windows.new_body = $('body &gt; *:not(div#do-not-modify-me)');

function select(selector) {
    return $(selector, windows.new_body);
}
</code></pre>

<p>So the other programmer should be able to do :</p>

<pre><code>// TEST RESULT CODE
select(""p"").css(""color"", ""red"");
</code></pre>

<p>It would color in red all the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> in the  body, but not the ones contained in div#do-not-modify-me.</p>

<p>The TEST CODE does not work, because currently, it applys css() on the children of the result of the context, not the result it self.</p>

<p>E.G : </p>

<pre><code>select(""p"").css(""color"", ""red"");
</code></pre>

<p>Behaves like :</p>

<pre><code>$('body &gt; * p :not(div#do-not-modify-me)').css(""color"", ""red"");
</code></pre>

<p>While the desired result would be :</p>

<pre><code>$('body &gt; p :not(div#do-not-modify-me)').css(""color"", ""red"");
</code></pre>

<p>Note that :</p>

<pre><code>$('body &gt; * :not(div#do-not-modify-me)').parent().css(""color"", ""red"");
</code></pre>

<p>Does not work because the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> div#do-not-modify-me turn into red.</p>

<p>How would you obtain the result in TEST RESULT CODE ? You can modify any part of the code.</p>

<p>To be run whenever the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element changes classes? If so, there is no ""onchangeclass"" event or anything like that, but you could actually create your own event to handle this:</p>

<p>This is actually kind of roundabout - it would be simplest to just do the logic in the click handler itself. The main advantage of moving it to its own event is that if you then need to do this elsewhere in the code you can keep that logic separate and just ""trigger"" it as you need.</p>

"<p>I'm trying to show a loading gif after a user clicks submit on a form.</p>

<p>I have search endlessly for a good tutorial showing how it done.</p>

<p>I get half way there but the gif doesn't hold for long enough, do any one know of a good tutorial or the scripts need to complete this.</p>
","16417","","<p>It's really simple. You have an image, initially hidden:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;img src=""myloadingimage.gif"" style=""display: none;"" id=""loading_image""&gt;

<p>You make an AJAX request:</p>

<pre><code>$('#loading_image').show(); // show loading image, as request is about to start
$.ajax({
    url: '..',
    type: '..',
    complete: function() {
        // request is complete, regardless of error or success, so hide image
        $('#loading_image').hide();
    }
});

<p>It's not rocket science, I promise. :)</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: In response to your comment, this uses jQuery. You put the jQuery tag so I assume that is fine.</p>

<p>I also noticed I didn't fully address your original question, which is that you want to show the loading bar for what is presumably a regular form. If your form tag has an id of ""myform"", this should do it:</p>

<pre><code>$('#myform').submit(function() {
    $('#loading_image').show(); // show animation
    return true; // allow regular form submission
});
</code></pre>

<p>You could also throw a line like this in:</p>

<pre><code>$(':submit',this).attr('disabled','disabled');
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to stop users from clicking submit more than once. This should still be verified server-side but it is a nice superficial barrier of defense.</p>

","16417","","<p>Whoever told you that is wrong; the user cannot change the data that you store in the <code>$_SESSION</code> array. What the user <em>could</em> edit is the cookie that is set with the sessionid so that PHP can recognize that user. They can't really realistically change it to another user's sessionid, though.

","16417","","<p>Inspecting the source code and how it changes as you change themes, it is really quite simple. Digg is harnessing the awesomeness of CSS to drastically change content by simply changing the class of an element. All you have to do is this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""theme_viewer""&gt;
&lt;!-- HTML code for your widget/thing to be styled --&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And then you can have your themes:</p>

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""#"" onclick=""return switchTheme('theme1');""&gt;theme 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

<pre><code>function switchTheme(theclass) {
    var viewer = document.getElementById('theme_viewer');
    viewer.className = theclass;
    return false;
}

}

#theme_viewer.theme2 {

}

#theme_viewer.theme3 {

}

#theme_viewer.theme4 {
    background-color: orange;
}
</code></pre>

<p><a href=""http://jsbin.com/opoji"" rel=""nofollow"">here is an example of this at work</a></p>

<p>As mentioned in the comments by J-P and in edeverett's answer, it is not a good idea to have your events inline as I have them in this example (ie, with the <code>onclick</code> attribute). I did it for simplicity, but it's not a good idea. The better idea is to wait for your document to load and attach the event handlers dynamically with Javascript. This is known as unobtrusive Javascript, and it is a Good Thing<sup>TM</sup>.</p>

<p>An example of the above example following good practices would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ul id='theme_options'&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""#"" id='theme1'&gt;theme 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""#"" id='theme2'&gt;theme 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""#"" id='theme3'&gt;theme 3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""#"" id='theme4'&gt;theme 4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And then we use this cross browser addEvent function (<a href=""http://ejohn.org/blog/flexible-javascript-events"" rel=""nofollow"">written by</a> John Resig, author of jQuery):</p>

<pre><code>function addEvent( obj, type, fn ) {
  if ( obj.attachEvent ) {
    obj['e'+type+fn] = fn;
    obj[type+fn] = function(){obj['e'+type+fn]( window.event );}
    obj.attachEvent( 'on'+type, obj[type+fn] );
  } else
    obj.addEventListener( type, fn, false );
}
</code></pre>

<p>To add the event handlers:</p>

<pre><code>addEvent(window, 'load', function() {
    var opts = document.getElementById('theme_options');
    var links = opts.getElementsByTagName('a');
    for(var x = 0; x &lt; links.length; x++) {
        addEvent(links[x], 'click', function() {
            switchTheme(links[x].id);
        });
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>It might be a little more verbose than inline Javascript, but it is worth it. I know you said you'd like to avoid jQuery, but something as simple as this makes you start appreciating the library, as you could do it with jQuery with something as simple as this:</p>

<pre><code>$(function() {
    $('a','#theme_options').click(function() {
        switchTheme($(this).attr('id'));
        return false;

","16417","","<p>Short answer: No, you can't be sure. Yes, it can drift.</p>

<p>Long answer: John Resig on the <a href=""http://ejohn.org/blog/accuracy-of-javascript-time/"">Accuracy of JavaScript Time</a> and <a href=""http://ejohn.org/blog/how-javascript-timers-work/"">How JavaScript Timers Work</a>.</p>

<p>From the second article:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In order to understand how the timers work internally there's one important concept that needs to be explored: timer delay is not guaranteed. Since all JavaScript in a browser executes on a single thread asynchronous events (such as mouse clicks and timers) are only run when there's been an opening in the execution.</p>

"<p>How to refresh the auto refresh div inside the div theres is php</p>

<p>The following code dont work?</p>

<pre><code>var refresh = setInterval(function() {  $(""#recent_activity"").html(); }, 1);
</code></pre>
","16417","","<p>Based on x0n's comment, which I think is a fair guess, I am guessing that you want to automatically refresh a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> with content from the server every X seconds. In your example, your second argument to the <code>setInterval</code> function is 1. This is a really bad idea, as the delay is in milliseconds, so you would be firing off 1000 requests a second (not that the browser would let you, but still).</p>

<p>Anyhow, if that's what you want, you would need to do this:</p>

<pre><code>var timer;
var seconds = 30; // how often should we refresh the DIV?

function startActivityRefresh() {
    timer = setInterval(function() {
        $('#recent_activity').load('recent_activity_ajax.php');
    }, seconds*1000)
}

function cancelActivityRefresh() {
    clearInterval(timer);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Your server-side script (<code>recent_activity_ajax.php</code> in the example) would then need to return whatever you want the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> to be populated with - just that, not the headers or footers or anything else. If you wanted this to start when the page loads, you would simply call <code>startActivityRefresh</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$(function() {
    startActivityRefresh();
});
</code></pre>

<p>If this is not at all what you meant by refreshing the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, you're going to need to clarify. :)</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:</p>

<p>In response to your comment: you can't make Javascript ""refresh"" the contents of the dynamic PHP code. This just isn't possible as the browser can't really execute a server side language like PHP. You have to call the server again. In order to make this cleanest you should probably move the code that fills the contents of <code>#recent_activity</code> to a function, call that once when the page loads and have a different file that simply outputs that code to be able to refresh it dynamically. You should probably look into MVC patterns from here, but I'm not sure if you're quite ready for that...</p>

"<p>This sounds like a really basic question.  Let's say I have the following Form element </p>

<pre><code>&lt;select id=""mySelect""&gt;

<p>...</p>

<p>Using jQuery, let's say I want to get it by ID so I can directly access one of its attributes like selectedIndex.  </p>

<p>I <strong>don't think</strong> I can use</p>

<pre><code>var selectedIndex = $(""#mySelect"").selectedIndex;
</code></pre>

<p>because the # selector returns an Array of Elements.  If I wish to actually access the select DOM element, then I have to call</p>

<pre><code>var selectedIndex = $(""#mySelect"").get(0).selectedIndex;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Is this correct?</strong>  Is there a selector that will let me get directly to the DOM element without having to make an ""extra call"" to get(0)?</p>

<p>I ask because I'm coming from Prototype where I can just say:</p>

<pre><code>var selectedIndex = $('mySelect').selectedIndex;
</code></pre>
","16417","","<p>There are jQuery ways to get the value of the <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> that don't require you to access the actual DOM element. In particular, you can simply do this to get the value of the currently selected option:</p>

<pre><code>$('#mySelect').val();
</code></pre>

<p>Sometimes, however, you do want to access a particular DOM attribute for whatever reason.</p>

<p>While the <code>.get(0)</code> syntax you provided is correct, it is also possible without the function call:</p>

<pre><code>$(""#mySelect"")[0].selectedIndex;
</code></pre>

<p>A jQuery collection behaves as an array-like object and exposes the actual DOM elements through it.</p>

"
"<p>I wont to run a block of code in a certain amount of time and then when done, carry on with another block of code.</p>
","16417","","<p>This is how you would do it, using the <a href=""http://www.w3schools.com/htmldom/met%5Fwin%5Fsettimeout.asp"" rel=""nofollow""><code>setTimeout</code></a> function, which takes code to call as the first argument and how much time it should wait before calling it (in milliseconds) as the second argument:</p>

}

setTimeout(function() {
    // initial code to run

}, 5000); // 5000 = run in 5 seconds

<p>Because of the nature of Javascript you have to encapsulate the code you want to run after the timeout is finished in its own function, otherwise it would be run before the timeout is finished. This is, in essense, a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callback%5F%28computer%5Fscience%29"" rel=""nofollow"">callback</a>, and it is a big part of the event-based nature of Javascript.</p>

<p>You have two options:</p>

<ul>
<li>Get rid of the <code>:</code> and using ""non standard"" attributes (honestly, it's not a big deal)</li>

<p>Speed wise this should be fairly close to jQuery's <code>[]</code> selector as that's what it's doing inside the library anyways. It is, of course, more to type every time you want to find an element that has an attribute, so you could write a plugin for it, since jQuery is awesome and lets you do this sort of thing:</p>

    return this.filter(function() {
        return $(this).attr(attr) !== undefined;

<p>Which would then let you do a much simpler:</p>

Keeping your current request in mind with the fact you've already got some advanced Javascript needs on your website, I recommend you check out <a href=""http://www.jquery.com"" rel=""nofollow"">jQuery</a> - you could then do something like this (simplified, of course, but perhaps it is enough to get you on your way):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ul id='menu'&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""pages/Home.html"" class=""home""&gt;&lt;span&gt;Home&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

<p>And then let you replace the montrocity you have for Javascript with this:</p>

<pre><code>$(function() {
    $('a', '#menu').click(function() { // when someone clicks on a menu link...
        // get the page contained in the links href attribute....
        $.get($(this).attr('href'), function(html) {
            // once the content is here, animate the content div...
            $('#MainContent').animate({
                height: '20px' // make the div smaller....
            }, 'fast', function() {
                // when it is all the way down, update the div with the new
                // html, and animate it back up....
                $(this).html(html).animate({
                    height: 'auto'
                }, 'fast');

        return false;

<p>This will make your website:</p>

<ol>
<li>More cross-browser compatible, as jQuery abstracts any incompatibilities out.</li>
<li>More standards/best-practices compliant (ie, no inline Javascript)</li>
<li>More accessible to people with Javascript disabled. As it is right now if I don't have Javascript enabled (~5% of people) and I click on any of your menu links nothing will happen. With this solution at the very least the page content will show up, although you could do some server-side code to make it so that the whole page shows if the request is not coming from Javascript.</li>

"<p>I have a page that is using tables, in FF etc it works perfect, but in IE7 it causes issues, its basically where the four corners have a td and and img (its a rounded corner form) .. if i remove the whitespace from the document it fixes the issue.. What actually happens is that it messes up the tables.. it puts a thin white line between the upper tr that holds the 2 corners and the next tr</p>

<p>I need to remove the the whitespace between the img and the TD, is there a better work around, as i have lots and not only that if i reformat the document the problem returns..</p>

Do I need to copy the before edit row html to a variable, and then later on cancel replace input boxes html? Thank you for your help.</p>

<p>EDIT</p>

<p>Also, if user clicks somewhere else on the page, it should consider it as cancel and bring the original data back. How to bind this action?</p>
","16417","","<p>First of all - look into Javascript frameworks. The kind of functionality you are talking about is advanced enough that if you really want your code to work in all browsers correctly you shouldn't do this on your own. It would also let you keep your HTML free of ugly inline Javascript and such, which is considered bad practice.That being said, here's a thought:</p>

<p>Have you considered having two rows per item, one of the row in ""edit mode"" and one of the row in ""normal mode""? You could style the ""edit mode"" rows to be hidden  by default, and when someone clicks on the edit link you can hide that row and bring the edit one into view. This would really be easier than doing an AJAX call to get the edit form.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p><a href=""http://jsbin.com/axiho"" rel=""nofollow"">Here's some code to get you started</a>:</p>

<pre><code>function editRow(row_id, callback) {
   // you would get this dynamically through ajax, thus why we need the callback
   var html = '&lt;tr id=""edit_' + row_id + '"" class=""edit""&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;input type=""text"" name=""td_1"" value=""Text 1""&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;input type=""text"" name=""td_2"" value=""Text 2""&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;input type=""submit"" name=""submit"" value=""submit""&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;';
   callback(html);
}

$('a.edit', '#data').click(function() {
    var $tr = $(this).closest('tr');
    var id = $tr.attr('id').split('_').pop();
    var edit_row = '#edit_' + id;
    if($(edit_row).length == 1) { // edit row already exists
        $tr.hide();
        $(edit_row).show();
    } else { // doesn't exist, fetch it
        editRow(id, function(html) {
            $tr.hide();
            $tr.after(html);
        });
    }
    return false;
});

$(window).click(function(e) {
    $('tr.edit:visible').each(function() {
        var $tr = $(e.target).closest('tr');
        var id = $(this).attr('id').split('_').pop();
        console.log(e.target, $tr, this);
        if($tr.attr('id') != this.id) {
            $(this).hide();
            $('#row_' + id).show();
        }
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>I should probably note that there are a lot of jQuery plugins that do a lot of this for you, and depending on the needs of your application you might be better off just fetching the row every time, not fetching them at all, etc. This is just a rough idea of what you might have to do to achieve what you want, and the rest is up to you. :)</p>

<p>Via CSS the actions-column is set to display:none by default. When a user mouseover's a post (div.row) I want to show the actions-column.

<p>As the documentation notes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When you bind a ""live"" event it will bind to all current and future elements on the page (using event delegation).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A couple more notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>I see you are using the <code>$(window).load()</code> event. You probably want <code>$(document).ready()</code></li>
<li>You should take advantange of jQuery's chaining capabilities instead of querying for <code>$('.posts')</code> twice, you can just append the second call at the end (like I did in my example above) - this is much more efficient and the preferred way of doing multiple things to 1 selector in jQuery.</li>
<li>The code you are trying to write to find the next <code>div.row</code> up the HTML tree has already been implemented by jQuery's <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Traversing/closest"" rel=""nofollow""><code>closest()</code></a> method.</li>
</ul>

<p>You could do something like this with it:</p>

<pre><code>$('div.posts').hover(function(e) {
    var row = $(e.target).closest('div.row');
    $row.find('div.actions-column').show();
}, function(e) {
    var row = $(e.target).closest('div.row');
    $row.find('div.actions-column').hide();
});
</code></pre>

<p>But this is not necessary because of the <code>live</code> functionality I showed above.</p>

<ul>
<li>Think about the efficiency of your queries. If you only have a single <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> with a class of posts, consider giving it an id attribute. This is by far the most efficient method of selecting elements in a document, and it makes sense to give it to elements that only occur once.</li>
<li>Whenever you are querying for an element by class, it is good practice to include the tag name before the class (unless you expect it to be in many different tags, of course) - so instead of looking for <code>.row</code>, make a habit of looking for <code>div.row</code> instead. It's just faster.</li>

"<p>I'm curious to know people's preferences...</p>

<p>I've recently gone head-first into jQuery and I am loving it. However, I'm finding that I'm replacing a lot of (somewhat trivial) backend (tech: ASP.NET) functions with tiny jQuery functions. For instance, rather than assign a navigation button as a back-end control and change its class when its page is landed on (ie, highlight the ""about"" button when on the about us page), I simply parsed the URL and added a class to the button:</p>

<pre><code>var pathname = window.location.pathname;
if (pathname == ""/about/"") {
    $(""#nav-about"").addClass(""selected"");
}
</code></pre>

<p>Solutions like these seem rather simple (maybe too simple), but I am always wary to rely too heavily on JavaScript. Does anyone else do similar things to this, and if so, how do you maintain code like this? How do you know where to strike the balance between good ol' trusty server code that works every time and fast, fancy, shiny jQuery that works pretty much every time, except when the user may have JavaScript turned off?</p>

<p>I'm not really speaking of this particular instance... I'm talking about little enhancements like this. What is the line you draw when it comes to jQuery enhancements or just do it on the server? Thanks :)</p>
","16417","","<p>My past few projects I have had the luxury of knowing that 100% of the users would have Javascript enabled. In that case, I actually did something very similar to what you have to save myself from having to highlight the current page in the navigation server-side.</p>

<p>Without that luxury, however, I consider shortcuts like this to be ""pushing it"" as far as using jQuery - sure, you can just say ""if they have Javascript disabled, then they just won't see the navigation page highlighted, it's not a big deal"" - while that may be true, it is a big deal to have the mentality to shun a more robust, reliable way of doing it server-side for no particularly good reason. It is important to stop yourself short of replacing battle-tested server-side solutions with ""easier"" code in the client. It is tempting, but not always the best thing for your project and your users, some of which will have JS disabled and may look at the navigation wondering where they are and find themselves ""lost"".</p>

<p>All in all, I would recommend you switch back to server-side code for this one. There's just no need to throw it away.</p>

"<p>I've written and played around with alot of PHP function and variables where the original author has written the original code and I've had to continue on developing the product ie. Joomla Components/Modules/Plugins and I've always come up with this question:</p>

<p>How does the '&amp;' symbol attached to a function or a variable affect the outcome?</p>

<p>For instance:</p>

<pre><code>$variable1 =&amp; $variable2;
</code></pre>

<p>OR</p>

<pre><code>function &amp;usethisfunction() {
}
</code></pre>

<p>OR</p>

<pre><code>function usethisfunction(&amp;thisvariable) {
{
</code></pre>

<p>I've tried searching through the PHP manual and other related sources but cannot find anything that specifically addresses my question.</p>
","16417","","<p>These are known as <a href=""http://us.php.net/manual/en/language.references.php"">references</a>.</p>

<p>Here is an example of some ""regular"" PHP code:</p>

<pre><code>function alterMe($var) {
    $var = 'hello';
}

$test = 'hi';
alterMe($test);
print $test; // prints hi

$a = 'hi';
$b = $a;
$a = 'hello';
print $b; // prints hi
</code></pre>

<p>And this is what you can achieve using references:</p>

<pre><code>function alterMe(&amp;$var) {
    $var = 'hello';
}

$test = 'hi';
alterMe($test);
print $test; // prints hello

$a = 'hi';
$b &amp;= $a;
$a = 'hello';
print $b; // prints hello
</code></pre>

<p>The nitty gritty details are in the documentation. Essentially, however:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>References in PHP are a means to access the same variable content by different names. They are not like C pointers; instead, they are symbol table aliases. Note that in PHP, variable name and variable content are different, so the same content can have different names. The closest analogy is with Unix filenames and files - variable names are directory entries, while variable content is the file itself. References can be likened to hardlinking in Unix filesystem. </p>

"<p>Im working on a php script to take an existing csv file (we'll call this one the template) and open it in a page and populate editable text fields with it's data between 1 and 50 times(user decides how many), which once edited to the users wishes, can then all be saved into a single combined csv file, separate from the template.</p>

<p>I included a link to a diagram of how i need this to work. I can open a csv, i can edit and save the csv, but i dont know how to dynamically take the number of clones the user needs, and render the template that many times in a way that when user is done, all fields are joined as rows of a single csv and saved to a new file.</p>

<p>The area highlighted in red, is the area im having trouble with.</p>

<p>The templates contain approx 25 fields, so each instance of the template (clone) will have 25 editable fields that are populated with the original data. Im confident that i can do this myself, but i need pointed in the right direction as to how to dynamically set the number of clones of the original template, and then combine said clones as rows in a single csv file once finished.</p>
","16417","","<p>You can name your fields as arrays:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type='text' name='field1[]'&gt;
&lt;input type='text' name='field2[]'&gt;
...
&lt;input type='text' name='field25[]'&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then keep track of how many fields you have and how many rows you have:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type='hidden' name='rowcount' value='50'&gt;
&lt;input type='hidden' name='fieldcount' value='25'&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then in the server side, <code>$_POST['field1']</code> will be an array you can easily manipulate:</p>

<pre><code>$fields = $_POST['fieldcount'];
$rows = $_POST['rowcount'];

$csv = array();
for($y = 0; $y &lt; $rows; $y++) {
    $row = array();
    for($x = 0; $x &lt; $count; $x++) {
        $row[$x] = $_POST['field' . ++$x];
    }
    $csv[] = $row;
}
// use fputcsv here.

<p>jQuery stores all the data information in the jQuery.cache internal variable. It is possible to get all the data associated with a particular object with this simple but helpful plugin:</p>

<pre><code>jQuery.fn.allData = function() {

$.each($('#myelement').allData(), function(key, value) {
    alert(key + ""="" + value);

"<p>I'm building an application which uses ajax calls for form validations and some others, problem is that I don't like it when those validation errors shows up on a new page with no css at all and form completely gets reset without the javascripts.</p>

<p>I'm talking about a dozen forms so, it will be quite annoying for the user to go through forms over and over again.</p>

<p>I've read some answers on this topic, but is there a specific way, a best-practice for a situation like this (more along the lines of form validation)?</p>

<p>Apologies if there is an answer already.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>All validations are done on the server-side, currently the errors are being displayed with the help of ajax. What I'd like is a convenient method for repopulating the form and display errors without javascript if an error occurs while processing the form.</p>
","16417","","<p>I'm not sure if you're implying by your question that you don't validate on the server - this would be considered a huge security hole as quite obviously forms could be bypassed by simply disabling Javascript. You have to validate in the server every time, while client-side validation is simply nice to do.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the ""problem"" of having the forms reset themselves when the page is reloaded becomes moot when you use a decent framework - In Python, Django auto-repopulates forms in the case of errors. In PHP, CakePHP and CodeIgniter do as well, and I'm sure most good frameworks do this, as it falls under the category of ""common tasks"" that frameworks are supposed to abstract away.</p>

<p>Whenever I'm not using a framework, I write up my own little Form class that fills the need.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: </p>

<p>I am not aware of anything you could plug-in to what you have to be able to repopulate the form. Your best bet is writing your own little class for it, which should take no more than 1 hour.</p>

<p>any ideas?</p>
","16417","","<p>If you really think about it, there's no reason to do a trip back to the server in this kind of situation. You can simply check server-side if the <code>promo</code> GET parameter was passed, and if so display a hidden <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> with the promotion information:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div style='display: none;' id='promo'&gt;

    if($('#promo').length &gt; 0) {
        showModal($('#promo').html());

});

<p>If you insist on querying the server through AJAX, this is fairly simple to do as well:</p>

  name = name.replace(/[\[]/,""\\\["").replace(/[\]]/,""\\\]"");
  var regexS = ""[\\?&amp;]""+name+""=([^&amp;#]*)"";

    }

}

if (!document.activeElement) {

","16417","","<p>First of all, if you are adding more than 1 <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> with that id, you are doing it wrong. <code>id</code> attributes should (must) be UNIQUE in a document.

It would be the equivalent of two people with the same social security number. :) The common and best practice when it comes to groups of elements is to give them all a class and select them that way.</p>

<p>Past that, you should look into the <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Events/live"" rel=""nofollow""><code>live</code></a> function, which does what you want. Essentially, when you run a piece of code on your document ready, it is being executed against the <em>current</em> state of the document. In other words, only elements that exist at that point in time (that match the selector provided) will be bound to the event you provided. The <code>live</code> function was created as a way to get around this. Another solution would be to run the binding code again after you add a new <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, but that is not as clean as just using <code>live</code>, which supports the <code>mouseover</code> and <code>mouseout</code> events you're going to need to do the <code>hover</code>.</p>

","16417","","<p>Since you didn't cover what I consider to be an astoundingly obvious question to ask, I must ask it:</p>

<p>Why aren't you using a database for this? PHP and MySQL have a beautiful, beautiful relationship that is borderline insulting to ignore for a situation like this. Unless you have a particularly especial circumstance that makes databases unavailable to you - which I honestly can't think of off the top of my head - you should go ahead and switch your code to use databases. They are <em>much</em> faster, <em>much</em> easier, and <em>much</em> better.  For the purposes of this site, though, a tutorial on how to do it would be rather lengthy. You should consider reading up on the <a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=php%2Bmysql"" rel=""nofollow"">many online tutorials</a> on this subject or perhaps buy a book.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:</p>

<p>Avoiding databases because you have to worry about SQL injections is like avoiding making a website at all because you have to worry about XSS attacks, or avoiding writing code at all because you could write a bug. Although SQL injections are popular security holes due to the many naive programmers out there, it is <em>trivial</em> to protect yourself against them by using prepared statements in <a href=""http://www.php.net/mysqli"" rel=""nofollow"">MySQLi</a> or <a href=""http://www.php.net/pdo"" rel=""nofollow"">PDO</a>. </p>

<p>As a side note, storing passwords as plain text is a <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/674904/salting-your-password-best-practices"">horrible idea</a>. The proper way to do it is to do a one-way encryption of the password upon insertion into the database, and whenever you want to check if someone provided the correct password you encrypt <em>that</em> password and compare it to the one in the database. If you don't do that, you're just asking for trouble.</p>

"<p>I have a function which, given a filename and directory path, checks if the directory already contains a file with the same name and if so returns an amended filename (by appending a number after the first part of the filename).

  <li>Compatibility – it has to work on every major browser on the market</li>
  <li>Ease of use – no or near-zero configuration needed for standard use cases</li>
  <li>Speed – it has to be fast, even for sufficiently large amounts of text</li>

"<p>I manage a system for academic software projects which, as well as other things, allows projects to provide web pages integrated with an instance of the Trac bug tracker / wiki / source browser. The idea is that the users have freedom to design their main pages as they like (they really like that), but with some convenience/branding features like common navigation elements, and an (unobtrusive) link bar across the top to link back to the main page and other hosted projects. For want of a better word, I'm using ""wrapping"" to describe this inserting of nav elements and the link bar into the documents. I know, I know: overloaded terminology. Sorry if you were expecting a carriage-return question ;)</p>

<p>For several years this system has worked fairly nicely with the ""wrapping"" implemented by a user-defined Apache 2 OutputFilter for text/html: as the HTML stream leaves the server, I parse the input HTML into a DOM, normalize the tree a bit if needed, and then insert the appropriate extra elements. A bit scrappy, but the best way I could find, and so far it's worked well. However, I'm now wanting to upgrade the Trac system to 0.11, in which some neat AJAX is used to lazily render directory trees without reloading: the effect is that the AJAX HTML stream <em>also</em> gets modified by the Apache filter, so that there are new ""top bars"" and nav furniture added each time I open a directory. This is obviously pretty sucky, and I'd rather that my users could also use AJAX if they want, rather than hack in a Trac-specific ""ignore the dir browsing HTTP requests"" system.</p>

<p>What I want to know is whether anyone has a better way to apply such post-processing to web pages... particularly ways that will intrinsically play a bit nicer with AJAX, without restricting my users' freedom to do what they want with their pages. Thanks!</p>

<p>I'm not familiar with this technique, so I must ask what exactly does the parsing? A language or is it a set of rules or what? If it's a language, you could check the headers of the request and if it is an AJAX request you could simply return the stream as is instead of adding the navigation.</p>

"<p>For a long time I've been not happy with the behavior of Google in the cases below, and  after accidentally noting that <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1011167/what-are-common-ui-misconceptions-and-annoyances/1011225#1011225"">80+ other people</a> feel the same way (and 20+ people upvote the idea of Google bug report) I thought it's useful to tap into SO's wisdom on HTTP protocols and the web culture.</p>

<p>This behavior appears every time I go to a different country and access <code>google.com</code> from my laptop or install a new browser. In many countries, including Vietnam, google automatically redirects to a localized version (e.g. <a href=""http://google.com.vn"">google.com.vn</a>), the one I can't actually read so I scan it in a desperate attempt to find <em>Google.com in English</em> link. </p>

<p>The first time it happened I was puzzled and spent some time finding out what could be wrong with my request headers; as I expected, my <code>Accept-Language</code> is always <code>en-US</code> or something like <code>en-US,ru;q=0.5</code>. Further tests with different IPs confirmed that they do IP geolocation, even when you are logged in. Later I learned there is a language query <code>?hl=...</code>, but still.</p>

<p>So, my question would be: do you think this is reasonable and expected behavior, webculture-wise? Do other sites do it too? <strong>If you were to design a multilanguage site what would you do with a person who comes from <code>.vn</code> IP but with <code>en-US</code> language?</strong></p>

<p>I imagine there are different approaches to IP geolocation:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>contra</strong>: I think this is impolite: I tell you explicitly what I want, 
what's good about giving me something else?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>pro</strong>: It could be that a person has just installed browser with the default language pack, without any idea about <code>Accept-*</code> headers, and still would prefer to see localized version of a website.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>contra</strong>: And yet, non-techie people can easily change accept-language by installing a language pack. In fact, if you go to download Firefox, chances are you'll download the one in the language you want, with the accept-language header that respects your wishes.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Note that I read the <a href=""http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.4"">HTTP 1.1 specification</a> from 1999 but they seem to omit the question of how much the <a href=""http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.4""><code>Accept-Language</code></a> should be really taken into consideration.</p>

<p>I believe this question belongs to SO as a web-app design question. And I'm still thinking about filing a formal bug report (if I am correct that this behavior is far from web standards).</p>
","16417","","<p>Google is smart. I imagine they do what they do because for the <em>majority</em> of cases if you're in Vietnam you most likely want <code>.vn</code> - we're technical people so we know all about accept-language and such, but the vast majority of people don't.</p>

<p>That being said, I think one thing they could to at least be polite to the accept-language header, is to show some kind of notification (kind of like the banners that show in this website) saying something like ""Looking for Google in English? Click here"" if the header indicated they want english - while that may not work for Google (as they don't do it), I would certainly consider that if I was making a multilingual website.</p>

","16417","","<p>This should do it, if you have a list like so:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ul id='menu' style='display: none;'&gt;
&lt;li&gt;item 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;item 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;item 3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;item 4&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;item 6&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;item 7&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You could then write code to show the list items sequentially like this:</p>

<pre><code>$('#menu').show().find('li').hide().bind('show', function() {
  $(this).show('slow', function() {
    $(this).next('li').trigger('show');
  });
}).filter(':first').trigger('show');
</code></pre>

<p>The code is doing the following: Finding the menu <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>, showing it, finding all the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> and hiding them, binding a custom event called <code>show</code> which slowly shows the element, and once it is fully shown looks to see if there are any <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> next to it and triggers the same event for that element. Then we filter from all the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> only the first one, and trigger this custom event for it, essentially setting off the domino effect.</p>

","16417","","<p>You use <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Core/eq""><code>eq</code></a>:</p>

<pre><code>$('ul li').eq(X);
</code></pre>

<p>Where X is a 0-based index of which element you want. You could also use the <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Selectors/eq#index"">selector form</a>:</p>

<pre><code>$('ul li:eq(X)');
</code></pre>

<p>And you could also achieve a similar result by using <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Selectors/nthChild#index""><code>nth-child</code></a>:</p>

<pre><code>$('ul li:nth-child(X)');
</code></pre>

<p>The documentation has this to say about the difference between <code>nth-child</code> and <code>eq</code>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While :eq(index) matches only a single element, this matches more than one: One for each parent with index. Multiple for each parent with even, odd, or equation. The specified index is one-indexed, in contrast to :eq() which starts at zero.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So by doing <code>$('ul li').eq(19);</code> you would get the single 20th matched element of the query (so if there is more than one list in the document this won't get you ""all 19th children"", while <code>$('ul li:nth-child(20)');</code> would get you the individual 20th matched list element of each <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> in the document.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:</p>

<p>To do something like ""second to last"", the sane way to do it would be like:</p>

<pre><code>var $ul = $('#mylist &gt; li');
var $el = $ul.eq($ul.length-2);
</code></pre>

","16417","","<p>I'm not really sure why you're writing a plugin to do this. This would find all the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> elements inside #parent, filter out those that don't have the class of <code>.no-change</code>, and edit the text contents of them:</p>

<pre><code>$('#parent').find('div').not('.no-change').text('Edited!');

","16417","","<p>This is known as <a href=""http://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.string.php#language.types.string.syntax.heredoc"">heredoc</a> syntax. The documentation will tell you everything you need to know.</p>

<p>Essentially, however:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A third way to delimit strings is the heredoc syntax: &lt;&lt;&lt;. After this operator, an identifier is provided, then a newline. The string itself follows, and then the same identifier again to close the quotation.</p>
  
  <p>The closing identifier must begin in the first column of the line. Also, the identifier must follow the same naming rules as any other label in PHP: it must contain only alphanumeric characters and underscores, and must start with a non-digit character or underscore. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So <code>EOB</code> is just what the author chose as his delimiter, not really sure what it stands for in his case but the identifier can be whatever you want.</p>

","16417","","<p>I can't really understand what you're trying to do, but this code is wrong:</p>

<pre><code>var title = $(this).find('name').text();
</code></pre>

<p>At that point, <code>this</code> is the current <code>&lt;key&gt;</code> element you are looping through. To get the value of the <code>name</code> attribute of this element, you would need to do this:</p>

<pre><code>var title = $(this).attr('name');
</code></pre>

<p>And then to get the <em>contents</em> of this element, you would do:</p>

<pre><code>var title = $(this).text();
</code></pre>

<p>In response to your comment, I think you want this:</p>

<pre><code>var title = $(this).find('key[name=c_AcknowledgementText]').text();
alert(title);

"<p>I have a URL which I want to open in a <a href=""http://fancy.klade.lv/"" rel=""nofollow"">FancyBox</a> (or any other overlay-type pop-up). I don't know in advance whether URL is good, so I want to test it. If invalid - I won't attach the fancyBox plugin to that particular URL, it will just be a regular link. <strong>How can I test a URL before attaching a plugin to it?</strong> Tried doing something like: </p>

<pre><code>$(""a.overlay"").each(function() {
    var xhr = $.get(this.href, function(data, status) {
        // never executed in case of a failed request
    });
    if (xhr.status &amp;&amp; xhr.status === 404)) {
        // not good, do nothing
    } else {
        // can attach plugin here
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is, <code>xhr</code> will not always be defined because JS doesn't wait for the request to complete. Similarly, I cannot use the callback function, because it doesn't seem to be executing in case the request fails (I can see it in Firebug, but that's not very useful).</p>

<p>Thanks and have a good weekend everyone.</p>
","16417","","<p>You can do it like this, although I would question how wise it is to make a request for each link....</p>

<pre><code>$(""a.overlay"").each(function() {
    var $a = $(this);
    $.ajax({
        type: 'GET',
        url: this.href,
        success: function() {
            // attach plugin here

        error: function() {
            // not good, log it
        }            
    });
});

<p>If you're not going to do anything with the contents of the page, you could switch 'GET' with 'HEAD' to only get the headers of the page requested, which would be faster and let you know what you want.</p>

"<p>I have an input box</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type=""text"" name=""search"" id=""search"" /&gt;
&lt;img src=""icon.png"" alt="""" id=""doSearch"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I use Jquery and I have onclick event for ""doSearch"". So when I enter some words like ""ab"" .. and click on ""icon"" It sends an ajax request to php file and gets results back appended to dom.</p>

<pre><code>  $('#doSearch').click(function() {
	$("".showResults"").show(""fast"");
	var input_text = $('input[name=""search""]').val(); //retrieve text
	$.ajax({
		method: ""get"" ...
		... some more lines 
	}) etc etc
</code></pre>

<p>I am wondering how can I trigger onclick function automatically, when some characters are entered in the input box so that users dont have to click on image icon to get the results. Also, how I can set focus on the image icon when I press tab key while in the input box.</p>

<p>Thanks a lot for your help.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>I have some other input boxes in the same form as well. So this input acts as somewhat similar to stack overflow tags input.</p>
","16417","","<p>The proper way to do it would be to do this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form id='search'&gt;
&lt;input type=""text"" name=""search"" id=""search"" /&gt;
&lt;input type=""image"" src=""icon.png"" /&gt;    
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>That way the image will be the submit button of the form, and whenever a user presses <kbd>enter</kbd> the form's submit event will be fired and you can do what you want.</p>

<p>This is how you could do the jQuery:</p>

<pre><code>$('#search').submit(function() {
    // do what you were doing
    return false; // prevent form submission
});
</code></pre>

<p>This will also have the upside of being friendly to people with Javascript disabled, as you could then check in the server if it is not an AJAX request and perhaps display the full page with the requested content instead. I am pretty sure this will also make it so that <kbd>TAB</kbd> goes to the image as well.</p>

"<p>like <code>@login_required</code>?</p>
","16417","","<p>It is decorator syntax.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A function definition may be wrapped by one or more decorator expressions. Decorator expressions are evaluated when the function is defined, in the scope that contains the function definition. The result must be a callable, which is invoked with the function object as the only argument. The returned value is bound to the function name instead of the function object. Multiple decorators are applied in nested fashion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So doing something like this:</p>

<pre><code>@login_required

"<p>I am working on a project that has to have authentication  (user name/pass)</p>

<p>It also connects to a database so i figured i would store the user name and password there but it seems like not such a good idea to have passwords as just a text field in a table sitting on the db</p>

<p>I'm using C# and connecting to a 2008 express server. can anyone suggest ( with as many examples as possible) what is the best way to store this type of data?</p>

<p>(i am open to the idea that this info not be stored in the db if a good reason can be provided)</p>
","16417","","<p>You are correct that storing the password in a plain-text field is a <em>horrible</em> idea. However, <em>as far as location goes</em>, for most of the cases you're going to encounter (and I honestly can't think of any counter-examples) storing the <em>representation</em> of a password in the database is the proper thing to do. By representation I mean that you want to hash the password using a salt (which should be different for every user) and a secure 1-way algorithm and store <em>that</em>, throwing away the original password. Then, when you want to verify a password, you hash the value (using the same hashing algorithm and salt) and compare it to the hashed value in the database.</p>

<p>So, while it is a good thing you are thinking about this and it is a good question, this is actually a duplicate of these questions (at least):</p>

</ul>

<p>To clarify a bit further on the salting bit, the danger with simply hashing a password and storing that is that if a trespasser gets a hold of your database, they can still use what are known as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table"">rainbow tables</a> to be able to ""decrypt"" the password (at least those that show up in the rainbow table). To get around this, developers add a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)"">salt</a> to passwords which, when properly done, makes rainbow attacks simply infeasible to do.  Do note that a common misconception is to simply add the same unique and long string to all passwords; while this is not <em>horrible</em>, it is best to add unique salts to every password. <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/420843/need-some-help-understanding-password-salt"">Read this for more.</a></p>

","16417","","<p>Err... that's a pretty horrible way of doing what you want, but you will fix it by replacing all the <code>.click</code> with <code>.live('click' </code> - at the time of you appending the events to all the elements, <code>dontclick2</code>, <code>3</code>, etc. do not yet exist. Read up on <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Events/live"" rel=""nofollow"">live</a> for more, or search around this site as this problem comes up quite often.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:</p>

<p>I couldn't resist. While <a href=""#1059561"" rel=""nofollow"">John's answer</a> provides a decent way for doing what you want, I am not a huge fan of mixing the Javascript with the markup like this. Whenever you want to add new funny messages and such you will have to be messing around with Javascript arrays and such which is kind of uncool.</p>

<p>The <em>best</em> way to do this (at least in my humble opinion) would be to have markup like this in your page:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ul id=""easter_messages"" style=""display: none;""&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don't click&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I told you not to click.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Now you will suffer.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shame!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You shouldn't click.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;But you did. Sigh.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This would be a semantically correct representation of what you have. You could use CSS like this on it:</p>

<pre><code>#easter_messages ul, #easter_messages li { margin: 0; padding: 0; }
#easter_messages li { cursor: pointer; list-style-type: none; display: inline; }
</code></pre>

<p>And finally, use this jQuery code:</p>

<pre><code>$('#easter_messages').show().find('li').hide().click(function() {
    var $li = $(this).next('li');
    if($li.length == 1) {
      $(this).hide();
      $li.show();
    }
}).filter(':first').show();
</code></pre>

<p>This code would essentially show the list, bind a click handler that finds the next list element relative to the one being clicked on, if it finds one it hides itself and shows that one, and then outside the click we show the first one to get things started.</p>

","16417","","<p>How about avoiding the first match?</p>

<pre><code>$jq(""button[id^=user][id$=edit]"").click(function() {

<p>Would select all buttons that have an ID that <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Selectors/attributeStartsWith#attributevalue"" rel=""nofollow"">starts with</a> user and <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Selectors/attributeEndsWith#attributevalue"" rel=""nofollow"">ends with</a> edit.</p>

<p>Although honestly, looking at your use case, it would be WAY better to simply give all buttons that are meant to edit a user a class of ""edit_user"" and then just do:</p>

<pre><code>$jq('button.edit_user').click(function() {

});
</code></pre>

<p>It is cleaner, faster, and the jQuery way of getting all elements that serve a similar purpose.</p>

<p>As far as getting the user id there's been some lively discussion on custom attributes on this site (<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/992115/custom-attributes-yay-or-nay"">Custom attributes - Yay or nay?</a>) and I personally do <code>data-userid='5'</code> in my elements and then just do <code>var id = $(this).attr('data-userid');</code> to get the ID. Nice and easy. Won't validate as XHTML, though.</p>

"<p>This problem is very strange and I'm hoping someone can help me.  For the sake of argument, I have a Author model with ForeignKey relationship to the Book model.  When I display an author, I would like to have a ChoiceField that ONLY displays the books associated with that author.  As such, I override the AuthorForm.<strong>init</strong>() method and I create a List of choices (tuples) based upon a query that filters books based upon the author ID.  The tuple is a composite of the book ID and the book name (i.e., (1, 'Moby Dick')).  Those ""choices"" are then assigned to the ModelForm's choices attribute.</p>

<p>When the form renders in the template, the ChoiceField is properly displayed, listing only those books associated with that author.</p>

<p>This is where things get weird.</p>

<p>When I save the form, I receive a ValueError (Cannot assign ""u'1'"":Author.book"" must be a Book instance).  This error makes sense due to the FK relationship.  However, if I add a ""print"" statement to the code, make no other changes, and then save the record, it works.  The ValueError magically disappears.  I've tried this a number of times, ensuring I haven't inadvertently made another change, and it works each time.</p>

<p>Does anyone know what's going on here?</p>
","16417","","<p>Not quite sure what you are doing wrong, but it is best to just modify the queryset:</p>

"<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I put this snippet of code in jsbin: <a href=""http://jsbin.com/eneru"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsbin.com/eneru</a></p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>I am trying to let the user resize (only vertically) a DIV element with jQuery. I read about jQuery UI, I tried it, and in some minutes, I had it working. But the library is adding a ~25KB overhead that I would like to avoid, since I only want simple vertical resizing.</p>

<p>So I tried to do it on my own. Here it is the HTML, I am using inline styling for clarity:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""frame"" style=""border: 1px solid green; height: 350px""&gt;
    &lt;div style=""height: 100%""&gt;Lorem ipsum blah blah&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;span id=""frame-grip"" style=""display: block; width: 100%; height: 16px; background: gray""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, there is a little bar under the DIV element, so the user can drag it up or down to resize the DIV. Here it is the Javascript code (using jQuery):</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function(){
    var resizing = false;
    var frame = $(""#frame"");
    var origHeightFrame = frame.height();
    var origPosYGrip = $(""#frame-grip"").offset().top;
    var gripHeight = $(""#frame-grip"").height();


    $(""#frame-grip"").mouseup(function(e) {
    	resizing = false;
    });

    $(""#frame-grip"").mousedown(function(e) {
    	resizing = true;
    });

    $(""#frame-grip"").mousemove(function(e) {
    	if(resizing) {
    		frame.height(e.pageY - origPosYGrip + origHeightFrame - gripHeight/2);
    	}
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>It works, more or less, but if you drag the bar too fast, it stops following the mouse movement and everything breaks.</p>

<p>It is the first time I try to do something <em>serious</em> (ahem) with JS and jQuery, so I may be doing something dumb. If so, please do tell me :)</p>
","16417","","<p>You <strong>are</strong> doing something dumb: You're trying to do it yourself.</p>

<p>Hear me out, hear me out: Javascript across browsers is a horrible, horrible thing. There are many engines in many versions with many different operating systems, all of which have many subtleties, all of which make Javascript pretty much hell to work with. There is a perfectly good reason why librabries such as jQuery (and their extensions) have exploded in popularity: a lot of great programmers have spent a lot of hours abstracting all these horrible inconsistencies away so we don't have to worry about it.</p>

<p>Now, I am not sure about your user base, maybe you are catering to old housewives that still have dialup. But for the most part in this day and age the 25KB hit on the initial page load (as it will be cached afterwards) for the peace of mind that this is going to work in all browsers consistently is a small price to pay. There is no such thing as ""simple"" resizing when it comes to Javascript, so you're better off using UI.</p>

<p>You are setting any element with a class of <code>.sitename</code> to have a specific width and hiding any overflow.</p>

    ...

<p>Not sure why you'd want to limit links to such a small width, but it is forcing the link text to wrap underneath which is then hiding ""Miami"" away because the overflow is hidden.</p>

"<p>I am teaching myself python. I was thinking of small programs, and came up with an idea to do a keno number generator. For any who don't know, you can pick 4-12 numbers, ranged 1-80, to match. So the first is part asks how many numbers, the second generates them. I came up with</p>

for i in x:
   random.randrange(1,81)

<p>In Python indentation matters. It is the way it knows when you're in a specific block of code. So basically we use the <code>xrange</code> function to create a range to loop through (we call <code>int</code> on x because it expects an integer while <code>raw_input</code> returns a string). We then print the <code>randrange</code> return value inside the for block.</p>

Sorry if this is bad SO etiquette. </p>

<p>In my .ready() function I have:</p>

<pre><code>jQuery(""#id_of_anchor"").click(function(event) { //start function when any update link is clicked
		Function_that_does_ajax();
		});
</code></pre>

<p>and my anchor looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href=""#"" id=""id_of_anchor""&gt; link text &lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>but when the link is clicked, the ajax function is performed as desired, but the browser scrolls to the top of the page. not good.</p>

<p>I've tried adding:</p>

<pre><code>event.preventDefault();
</code></pre>

<p>before calling my function that does the ajax, but that doesn't help. 
What am I missing?</p>

<p>Clarification</p>

<p>I've used every combination of </p>

<pre><code>return false;
event.preventDefault(); 
event.stopPropagation();
</code></pre>

<p>before and after my call to my js ajax function. It still scrolls to the top.</p>
","16417","","<p>That should work, can you clarify what you mean by ""before""? Are you doing this?</p>

});
</code></pre>

<p>Because that <strong>should</strong> work in the sense that if it's not working YOU are doing something wrong and we'd need to see more code. However, for the sake of completeness, you could also try this:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>The point of document.ready is to wait for the DOM to be ready; if you try doing <code>$('#numbers');</code> outside of it (and the code does not appear after the element in the document) the DOM will not have yet created this element so you won't have a proper reference to it.</p>

<p>Once you do this, you should be able to do:</p>

<pre><code>destTable.append(newRow);
</code></pre>

<p>Inside the <code>click</code> function. As a last note, however, it is a common and accepted practice to preface variables that represent jQuery sets with a <code>$</code>. So this is best:</p>

<pre><code>var $destTable = $(""#numbers"");

"<p>I've created a javascript function that will take a hidden span, copy the text within that span and insert it into a single textarea tag on a website. I've written a function in JavaScript that does this (well, kinda, only after a few clicks), but I know there's a better way - any thoughts? The behavior is similar to a Retweet for twitter, but using sections of a post on a blog instead. Oh, and I'm also calling out to jquery in the header.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
function repost_submit(postID) {    
    $(""#repost-"" + postID).click(function(){
        $(""#cat_post_box"").empty();
        var str = $(""span#repost_msg-"" + postID).text();
        $(""#cat_post_box"").text(str);
    });
}
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
","16417","","<p>Based on the comment in your question, I am assuming you have something like this in your HTML:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href=""#"" onclick=""repost_submit(5);""&gt;copy post&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And I am also assuming that because you are passing a post ID there can be more than one per page.</p>

<p>Part of the beauty of jQuery is that you can do really cool stuff to sets of elements without having to use inline Javascript events. These are considered a bad practice nowadays, as it is best to separate Javascript from your presentation code.</p>

<p>The proper way, then, would be to do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href=""#"" id='copy-5' class='copy_link'&gt;copy post&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And then you can have many more that look similar:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href=""#"" id='copy-5' class='copy_link'&gt;copy post&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=""#"" id='copy-6' class='copy_link'&gt;copy post&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=""#"" id='copy-7' class='copy_link'&gt;copy post&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, you can write code with jQuery to do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>$(function() { // wait for the DOM to be ready
    $('a.copy_link').click(function() { // whenever a copy link is clicked...
        var id = this.id.split('-').pop(); // get the id of the post
        var str = $('#repost_msg-' + id); // span not required, since it is an ID lookup
        $('#cat_post_box').val(str); // empty not required, and val() is the proper way to change the value of an input element (even textareas)
        return false;
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>This is the best way to do it even if there is only one post in the page. Part of the problem with your code is that on the first click it BINDS the function, and in the subsequent clicks is when it finally gets called. You could go for a quick and dirty fix by changing that around to just be in document.ready.</p>

You also never really want to do stuff like <code>display: table;</code> - it's just hackish and as you found out doesn't work on all browsers. Since this way avoids floating you also don't need to have the clear element in there, although you could have removed that anyways by adding <code>overflow: auto;</code> to the <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>. Hope it helps.</p>

<p>jQuery does not expose the regular DOM attributes directly through its <code>$()</code> function. What you have there is a wrapped set (that, granted, will only ever match 1 element but is a set nonetheless) that extends the elements and adds all the jQuery goodness to it.</p>

<p>If you wanted to get the native DOM element of <code>#EnterLinkX</code>, you would do this:</p>

<p>This works because the return value of <code>$()</code> is an array-like structure that contains the matched elements. <code>[0]</code> would contain the first (and in this case only) match. This would then give you access to stuff like <code>innerHTML</code> and such. 99% of the time, though, you are better off doing it the ""jQuery way"" as that's the whole point of the library. In this case, you would use it's <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Attributes/attr"" rel=""nofollow""><code>attr</code></a> function to set the attribute, and it's <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Attributes/removeAttr#name"" rel=""nofollow""><code>removeAttr</code></a> function to remove the disabled value if you ever wanted to.</p>

"<p>I'm trying to get the value of a few checkboxes and enter them in a hidden form field, is there a way to do that in jQuery,</p>

&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I only need to submit the hidden field data so I'd like the value of the hidden field change when the checkbox is ticked. So if the first checkbox is ticked I'd like the value of the hidden field to become <code>chicken</code> and if both of them are ticked the value should be chicken,meat.</p>

<p>thanks for your help.</p>
","16417","","<p>I think this is a cleaner approach to what has been offered so far...</p>

<pre><code>var values = [];
$('#chicken, #meat').filter(':checked').each(function() {
    values.push($(this).attr('id'));
});
$('#hidden_field').val(values.join(','));
</code></pre>

<p>Instead of updating the hidden field when a user checks one of the boxes, you should run the above code in the form's submit event, so it only has to do it once when the form is finally being sent:</p>

<pre><code>$('#myform').submit(function() {
    // update the hidden field...
    var values = [];
    $('#chicken, #meat').filter(':checked').each(function() {
        values.push($(this).attr('id'));
    });
    $('#hidden_field').val(values.join(','));

    // and submit the form
    return true;
});
</code></pre>

<p>Also, as it is right now the only place where I could easily tell the value you want is coming from is the <code>id</code> attribute of the checkboxes. The solutions that are using <code>val()</code> that were posted would return blank because you have no <code>value=""""</code> attribute in your checkboxes. If you wanted to update the hidden field with the <code>value=""""</code> attribute (which is the expected behavior) you should add the attribute in and then change <code>$(this).attr('id')</code> to <code>$(this).val()</code> in the code above.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> (in response to comment):</p>

<p>If you have more than the 2 checkboxes that you show, you need to change the selector. Above I used <code>$('#chicken, #meat')</code>. If you wanted to include <em>all</em> the checkboxes in the document, you would change it to <code>$('input:checkbox')</code>, but probably the best way (to avoid unexpected behavior later on) is to give all the checkboxes you want to include in the hidden field a common class and then make your selector something like <code>$('input.myclass:checkbox')</code>. Finally, as long as you match your form's ID to ID I used above (<code>myform</code>) then the updating of the hidden field should be taken care of for you automatically when the form is submitted (assuming also the hidden field has an id of <code>hidden_field</code> and the user has Javascript enabled...). Also, you need to make sure the form binding code above is wrapped around <code>$(document).ready(function() { // code here });</code> otherwise the code will run before the DOM is ready and you will be binding the event to a non-existent element.</p>

"<p>How to get the file names inside a directory using PHP?</p>

<p>I couldn't find the relevant command using Google, so I hope that this question will help those who ire asking along the similar lines.</p>
","16417","","<p>There's a lot of ways. The older way is <a href=""http://www.php.net/scandir""><code>scandir</code></a> but  <a href=""http://www.php.net/manual/en/class.directoryiterator.php""><code>DirectoryIterator</code></a> is probably the best way.</p>

<p>Here are some examples on how to use each one to print all the files in the current directory:</p>

<h3><code>DirectoryIterator</code> usage: (recommended)</h3>

<pre><code>foreach (new DirectoryIterator('.') as $file) {
    if($file-&gt;isDot()) continue;
    print $file-&gt;getFilename() . '&lt;br&gt;';

    if($file == '.' || $file == '..') continue;
    print $file . '&lt;br&gt;';

<h3><code>opendir</code> and <code>readdir</code> usage:</h3>

<pre><code>if ($handle = opendir('.')) {
    while (false !== ($file = readdir($handle))) {
        if($file == '.' || $file == '..') continue;

    if($file == '.' || $file == '..') continue;
    print $file . '&lt;br&gt;';
}

<p>As mentioned in the comments, <code>glob</code> is nice because the asterisk I used there can actually be used to do matches on the files, so <code>glob('*.txt')</code> would get you all the text files in the folder and <code>glob('image_*')</code> would get you all files that start with image_</p>

","16417","","<p>Your code is correct (aside from the missing <code>);</code> I assume is just a pasting mistake) and should work.</p>

<p>The only reason why it wouldn't work is if you don't have your code wrapped around $(document).ready. If you are not familiar with $(document).ready it is a special event that jQuery has that fires as soon as the entire DOM structure is ready to be manipulated. If you have your Javascript at the top of your page anything you run outside of $(document).ready will be acting against an empty DOM because the browser has not had time to create the nodes yet. So whenever you want to manipulate elements (especially a query to get <em>all</em> the elements that have a title) you definitely need to put the code around this special event.</p>

<p>Keeping that in mind, I tried the following code, which would put a red border around elements with a title:</p>

    $(""[title]"").each(function() {

<blockquote>
  <p>2009-07-06T15:54:12.000+02:00</p>
</blockquote>

<p>OK... is there any hidden gem of markup that will tell the browser to convert that string into a localized version of it?</p>

<p>The closest solution is using Javascript's Date.prototype.toLocaleString().   It certainly does a good job, but it can be slow to iterate over a lot of dates, and it relies on Javascript.</p>

<p>Is there any HTML, CSS, XSLT, or otherwise semantic markup that a browser will recognize and automatically render the correct localized string?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>:  </p>

<p>The method I am currently using is replacing the text of an HTML element with a localized string:</p>

<p>Starting with:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;span class=""date""&gt;2009/07/06 15:54:12 GMT&lt;/span&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Using Javascript (with jQuery):</p>

<pre><code>var dates = $(""span.date"", context);
// use for loop instead of .each() for speed
for(var i=0,len=dates.length; i &lt; len; i++) {
    // parse the date
    var d = new Date(dates.eq(i).text());
    // set the text to the localized string
    dates.eq(i).text(d.toLocaleString());
}
</code></pre>

<p>From a practical point of view, it makes the text ""flash"" to the new value when the Javascript runs, and I don't like it.</p>

<p>From a principles point of view, I don't get why we need to do this - the browser should be able to localize standard things like currency, dates, numbers, as long as we mark it up as such.</p>

","16417","","<p>It is not possible to do this with HTML, it has no smart tags that can make any kind of decisions like this. It is strictly presentational. I do wonder, though, if HTML5 perhaps has a tag for something like this...</p>

<p>Anyways, the way I see it, you have 3 options:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Stick to the Javascript way.

<li><p>Try to use geolocation. That is, your server side script fires off a request to one of the many geolocator services out there on the user's first page visit to try and guess where the user is. The downside of this is that it will be wrong about 10% of the time, so it's not that much better than the market share Javascript is going to get you.... (all in all, then, not a very good method...)</p></li>
<li><p>Ask the user! You will see that most websites that want to display a tailored experience for you will ask you this sort of thing because it's just not possible to know. As a neat fallback, you could wrap the question around <code>&lt;noscript&gt;</code> tags so you only ask those with Javascript disabled while offering the Javascript experience to those that have it.</p></li>

<p>Or, better, yet, you could use a templating system (which PHP kind of is) or a MVC framework to separate your business and presentational logic so you don't have to go around printing stuff like input fields in the first place. :)</p>

"<p>I have a div with an id of 'gallery' and I want to style the images inside it. Specifically, I want to give each of the images a 1px solid yellow border except on the bottom because they sit on top of each other, so I don't want to double the border on the bottom.</p>

<p>What I'm confused about is how to choose between the different border style elements: border, border-style, border-width. I tried this:</p>

<pre><code>div#gallery img
{
    border-width:1px;
    border-style:solid;
    border: solid yellow;
    border: 1px 1px 0px 1px;

<p>The syntax for the <a href=""http://www.w3schools.com/css/css%5Fborder.asp"" rel=""nofollow""><code>border</code></a> declaration goes <code>width style color</code> and affects all four borders.

"<p>I have a script which hides (display:none) certain divs in the list on page load. Div contents represents description of a book, and the whole list is some sort of bibliography.  Every div has an id, for example, ""div1"", ""div2"" etc. </p>

<pre><code>&lt;ul&gt;  
&lt;li&gt;&lt;div class=""hidden"" id=""div1""&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

","16417","","<p>You can do something like this on the target page:</p>

    }

<p>As you can see when you mouse over the images the div slides up and down to show more information. Unfortunately I have 2 problems that i can't figure out and I've searched but haven't found quite the right answer through google and was hoping someone could point me in the direction of a tutorial.</p>

<p>The first problem is that when you mouse over an image it changes to color (loads a new image), but there's a short delay when the image is loading for the first time so the user sees white. Do I have to preload the images or something in order to fix that?</p>

<p>My second problem is that when you move your mouse over the 'additional content area' it goes crazy and starts going up and down a bunch of times. I just don't have any idea what would cause this but i hope one of you will!</p>

<p>All my code is directly in the source of that page if you would like to view the source.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for your help!</p>
","16417","","<p>Yes, you have to preload the images. Thankfully, this is simple:</p>

<pre><code>var images_to_preload = ['myimage.jpg', 'myimage2.jpg', ...];
$.each(images_to_preload, function(i) {
    $('&lt;img/&gt;').attr({src: images_to_preload[i]});
});
</code></pre>

<p>The other thing you have to understand is that when you use jQuery you have to truly embrace it or you will end up doing things the wrong way. For example, as soon as you find yourself repeating the same piece of code in different places, you are probably doing something wrong. Right now you have this all over the place:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""service"" onmouseover=""javascript:mouseEnter(this.id);"" onmouseout=""javascript:mouseLeave(this.id);""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Get that out of your head. Now. Forever. Always. Inline javascript events are not proper, especially when you have a library like jQuery at your disposal. The proper way to do what you want is this:</p>

<pre><code>$(function() {
    $('div.box').hover(function() {
        $(this).addClass('active');
        $(this).find('div.slideup').slideDown('slow');
    }, function() {
        $(this).removeClass('active');
        $(this).find('div.slideup').slideUp('slow');
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>(You have to give all the #industrial, #sustainable, etc elements a class of 'box' for the above to work)</p>

<p>These changes will also fix your sliding problem.</p>

<p>Essentially, we create an empty <a href=""http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref%5Fobj%5Fdate.asp"">Date object</a> and set the year, month, and date with the <a href=""http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref%5FsetFullYear.asp""><code>setFullYear()</code></a> function.

"<p>Similar to <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/152975/how-to-detect-a-click-outside-an-element"">this question</a>, but taking it a step further.  I would like to detect clicks outside of a set of items, which I am handling in the following way:</p>

<pre><code>$('#menu div').live('click', function() {
    // Close other open menu items, if any.
    // Toggle the clicked menu item.

    $('body').one('click', function(event) {
        // Hide the menu item.
        event.stopPropagation();
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>This works like a charm, unfortunately, when another menu item is open and a
second is clicked, it requires two clicks to open the second item.  The first
click hides the first menu item that was open, the second shows the second menu
item.</p>

<p>The ""correct"" behavior works in the following way:</p>

<ul>
<li>Clicking a menu item opens it. </li>
<li>Clicking the same menu item (or it's children) closes it.</li>
<li>Clicking another menu item closes the first, opens the second.</li>
<li>Clicking away from (open) menu items closes them. </li>
</ul>

<p>I have tried the following in place of the above <code>$('body').one()</code> order to ignore clicks on menu items with little success:</p>

<pre><code>// Captures click on menu items in spite of the not.
$('*').not('#menu *').one('click', function() { // Hide menu }
$('*:not(#menu)').one('click', function() { // Hide menu }

","16417","","<p>This is the wrong question to be asking, because you are not supposed to have duplicate IDs in a document. An ID is like the social security number of an element. You can't give multiple elements the same one, because then when you tell Javascript to find an element by ID it will be terribly confused by the fact there's more than one and give you unexpected results. The reason ID lookups are as fast as they are is because the browser can have a hash table of ID->element - violating that understanding is a bad practice, to say the least.</p>

<p>When you have several elements that are all of the same ""type"", the proper practice is to class them:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""first""&gt;
    &lt;div class=""here""&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;

"<p>I have an admin page for a store where a user can modify item data. I'm trying to implement something for the admin to add and remove images by dragging them to and from a div. </p>

<p>I can submit the data just fine until I add the ""images"" object to the mix as follows:</p>

<pre><code>$(""#saveButton"").click(function() {
    $(""form *, button"").attr(""disabled"", ""true"");
    formData = $(""#itemForm"").formHash();
    formData[""item""] = $(""#itemSelector option:selected"").val();
    formData[""action""] = ""save"";
    formData[""images""] = {};
    $(""#otherImages img"").each(function(i){
        formData[""images""][i] = $(this).attr(""src"");
    });
    $.ajax({
        type: ""POST"",
        url: ""adminajax.php"",
        data: formData
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>Here, the ""images"" value is submitted as ""[object Object]"".</p>

<p>I would like to have ""images"" be an associative array on the server.</p>

<p>One workaround is to simply have several image keys: ""image1: source"", ""image2: source"" etc, however, it would really be nice if it could be an object so that I can do a for-each on ""images"" instead of filtering the key strings.</p>

<pre><code>formData['images'] = $.map($(""#otherImages img""), function(i) {

"<p>I have an anchor that doesn't go anywhere but has an onclick (e.g. <code>&lt;a onclick=""...""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</code>). My question pertains to the <code>href</code> attribute. What should I put for the value?</p>

<p>If I simply omit <code>href</code>, the anchor doesn't have the appropriate decoration--the mouse pointer icon doesn't change when the mouse is put over it.</p>

<p>If I use <code>href=""javascript:...""</code> and put the value of <code>onclick</code> proceeding <code>javascript:</code>, the page is left and the address bar contains the Javascript when the link is clicked.</p>

<p>When I refer to browser behavior, I'm referring to Chrome, which I'm testing it in to start with.</p>

<p>What should I be putting for <code>href</code> when the anchor isn't an actual link but exists only to have the <code>onclick</code> perform behavior?</p>
","16417","","<p><em>Ideally</em> you would have an option for those with Javascript disabled:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href=""degrade_option.html"" onclick=""return fancy_option();""&gt;do the option!&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If you're not into that sort of thing, although you really should be,  the most common way is to use the pound but then cancel the event to prevent the default action from happening, like so:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href=""#"" onclick=""return do_something();""&gt;do something&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But then you have to make sure <code>do_something</code> returns <code>false</code>. (or you can just add <code>return false;</code> at the end of the click handler, but this gets even more unsightly fast)</p>

<p>Although, to be honest, you really shouldn't have inline Javascript attributes to begin with. They are bad practice, a nightmare to maintain, and there are much better alternatives out there.</p>

"<p>Where can I use ids and classes? What is the difference between them? Is there any need that we should compulsorily use ids in our CSS?</p>
","16417","","<p>IDs are meant to be unique, while classes are better for a ""type"" of element.</p>

<p>So you might have something like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ul id=""menu""&gt;
....
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Because you will probably only have 1 main menu on your site.</p>

<p>For classes, however, you might have something like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;span class='author'&gt;Paolo Bergantino&lt;/span&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Or perhaps to style the <code>div</code> that contains an answer on this site:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class='answer'&gt;....&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Because there will be multiple of these per page, they are a class of elements. Think of an ID as the social security number of an element. Whenever an element is important enough and is unique, you give it an ID. This also helps with dynamic websites as selecting elements by ID is by far the fastest way, and if you have multiple elements with the same ID (thus violating this practice) Javascript won't work as intended.</p>

","16417","","<p>This is because when you bind an event it only binds it to the elements that are in the DOM at that time. So if you add new ones later on they won't be bound to the event you previously attached. Assuming you have jQuery 1.3, it has a built-in function to get around this called <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Events/live"" rel=""nofollow""><code>live</code></a>. With it, you can bind an event to all current and future elements. It doesn't support all events, but <code>click</code> it does support.</p>

<p>So keeping that in mind, you just have to replace this:</p>

<pre><code>$('.link').bind('click', function(e) {
</code></pre>

<p>With this:</p>

<pre><code>$('a.link').live('click', function(e) {
</code></pre>

<p>(I added the a. to the selector because it is much more efficient to specify the tag if at all possible)</p>

<p>If you don't have jQuery 1.3, you should upgrade as soon as possible. If you can't, check out the <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/livequery"" rel=""nofollow"">livequery</a> plugin which achieves the same thing but in a much less elegant way. Alternatively, you can simply have a function to bind the action and call it everytime you load new data in. All things considered, however, jQuery's <code>live</code> is the best way to do this.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, I am on the camp that believes data attributes are the best way to go. They are being introducted in HTML5 to avoid name conflicts. Essentially, if you want to store anything data related you just prepend ""data-"" on the attribute name:</p>

","16417","","<p>Any reason you are using live? It's not necessary if the HTML is already there when the page loads.</p>

<p>Anyhow, the proper way to stop the form submission if you are using AJAX is not to catch the button's click event, but the form's submit event. You can then cancel the form's default action and do your AJAX stuff. This is best for usability.</p>

<p>This would be appropriate for the HTML above:</p>

<pre><code>$(function() {
    $('#form').submit(function() {
        $.ajax({
            data: $(this).serialize(),
            url: $(this).attr('action'),
            type: $(this).attr('method'),
            success: function(r) {
                //...
            }
        });
        return false; // prevent form from submitting
    });
});

"<p>I'm a bit stuck on what is probably a common situation, but can't find much in the way of solutions.</p>

<p>I'm passing a single int parameter to an MVC controller method, expecting a Json response back.  Problem is, the parameter, while being populated at the client end, is not being recognised at the server end and is being interpreted as null.</p>

<p>Here's the code:</p>

<pre><code>function getBatches(p) {
$.ajax({
    type: ""GET"",
    data: ""{'ProjectID': "" + p + ""}"",
    url: ""/Home/Batches"",
    success: function(msg) {
        populateBatches(msg);
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>The value for p is an integer.  On the server end, the code looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>[AcceptVerbs(HttpVerbs.Get)]
public JsonResult Batches(int ProjectID)
{
    return Json(TimeHelper.GetBatchesForProject(ProjectID));
}
</code></pre>

<p>I've tried altering it slightly so that the server-side int argument is nullable (i.e. <code>int? ProjectID</code>) but again, that doesn't appear to help.  The problem is somewhere in the translation.  Ideas?</p>

<p>Is there any way to achieve this cross browser?</p>
","16417","","<p>You probably are not including a DOCTYPE in your document, thus throwing IE into quirks mode.</p>

<p>Add this at the top of your file, for example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN""
  ""http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd""&gt;

<p>See the difference here: <a href=""http://jsbin.com/oloja"">with doctype</a>, <a href=""http://jsbin.com/ufamu"">without doctype</a>.</p>

<p>It is a very good practice to always include a DOCTYPE into your document to make your website be as consistent as possible across browsers. With a DOCTYPE and a reset stylesheet cross browser layouts are much more reliable.</p>

<p>The above DOCTYPE is just one of many choices. For more, check out <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/414891/whats-up-doctype"">this stackoverflow question</a></p>

"<p>I have a problem setting the CSS class for each cell in a given table row. Initially I thought setting the parent row CSS would affect the style properties of cells, 
but that doesn't work. Instead I have to loop through all the cells in a given row to updated the CSS class.</p>

<p>However this is not efficient. And it took a lot of time. Consider my situation: I have around 230 rows in which each row has 23 cells (totally 5290 cells). </p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> I don't use any frameworks. so please can you suggest an approach in native JS?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE :</strong></p>

<p>its working fine using the Paolo's recommendation..</p>

<p>Initially my custom css class is been like this</p>

<pre><code>.Grid_RowItalicsBold { PADDING-RIGHT: 5px; PADDING-LEFT: 8px; FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 8pt; OVERFLOW: hidden; COLOR: Black; LINE-HEIGHT: 15pt; FONT-STYLE: normal; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana, Arial, Sans-Serif; WHITE-SPACE: nowrap; BACKGROUND-COLOR: yellow; TEXT-DECORATION: none }

","16417","","<p>Why can't you set the class of the row and adjust your css accordingly?</p>

   &lt;td&gt;...&lt;/td&gt;

<p>Then in CSS:</p>

<pre><code>tr.myclass td {
    ...
}

for(var x = 0; x &lt; rows.length; x++) {
    rows[x].className = rows[x].className + "" myclass"";
}

<p>If you're doing this to the whole table, though, you might as well just give a class to the table tag itself then do:</p>

<pre><code>table.myclass tr td {
    ...
}

","16417","","<p>It doesn't work because you are dynamically adding/removing the class after the elements are bound to specific element/class combinations. That is to say, you are adding the click event to links with a class of ""show-para"" before there are any links with that class (or maybe the other way around depending on your default)</p>

<p>In either case, jQuery has the <code>live</code> function to get around that, just change your <code>click</code> handlers to <code>.live('click', function(){ })</code></p>

"<p>I have 16 <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> items.<br>
Upon clicking a button, I run the following code which removes a <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> item.</p>

<pre><code>jQuery('.btnRemoveItem').live(""click"",function(){
    var obj = this;
    jQuery.post(""wp-content/themes/storelocator/include/adm_gallery.php"", { deleteImage: 'single', name: jQuery(this).attr('id') },
    function(data){
        if(data.status == 'deleted');

            jQuery(obj).closest('li').fadeOut(400, function() { $(this).remove(); });

            jQuery('#imageCount').html(count);
        }
    }, ""json"");

});

<p>This code works and removes the list item. However, doing a item count, still returns 16 items.
I therefore need to bind the event somehow. I thought maybe that <code>$.live</code> would help, but it has no effect.</p>

<p>How should I go around to ""bind"" the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> removal?</p>
","16417","","<p>It is not working because you are not removing the element until it finishes fading out which takes 400ms, meanwhile the rest of the code moves on and the count still sees the soon-to-be-deleted <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>Simply move the two lines below the fadeout to be inside the callback function and it will work as you intend.</p>

","16417","","<p>I recently stumbled upon this awesome feature of Django and reading <a href=""http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/contenttypes/"" rel=""nofollow"">the docs</a> page made it all clear.</p>

<p>To expand a little bit, generic relations is when you want a Model to be able to be associated to more than 1 other Model. In the example above, because it is using a GenericKey, a Comment can belong to multiple models (like a Question or an Answer, etc.)</p>

<p>In my particular use sample, I had an AddressProfile model and I wanted both the User model and the Company model to be able to have an AddressProfile. I initially simply had two ForeignKeys in the AddressProfile with null=True so I could specify whichever relation it was, but the GenericKey functionality made it much cleaner for me.</p>

<p>You can figure out the other one, although I would generally advise to <code>addClass</code> and <code>removeClass</code> instead of messing with CSS styles directly. You also wouldn't need to mess with the <code>href</code> if you simply <code>return false;</code> inside the click function while leaving the <code>href</code> in the actual HTML to be something that degrades gracefully.</p>

"<p>Maybe I am just having a slow day, but for the life of me I can't figure out why this is happening. I haven't done CakePHP in a while and I am trying to use the 1.3 version, but this doesn't seem to be working...</p>

<p>I have two models:</p>

<h3>area.php</h3>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
class Area extends AppModel {
    var $name = 'Area';
    var $useTable = 'OR_AREA';
    var $primaryKey = 'A_ID';

    var $belongsTo = array(
        'Building' =&gt; array(
            'className' =&gt; 'Building',
            'foreignKey' =&gt; 'FK_B_ID',
        ),
        'Facility' =&gt; array(
            'className' =&gt; 'Facility',
            'foreignKey' =&gt; 'FK_F_ID',
        ),
        'System' =&gt; array(
            'className' =&gt; 'System',
            'foreignKey' =&gt; 'FK_S_ID',
        )
    );
}
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<h3>building.php</h3>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
class Building extends AppModel {
    var $name = 'Building';
    var $useTable = 'OR_BLDG';
    var $primaryKey = 'B_ID';

    var $hasMany = array(
        'Area' =&gt; array(
            'className' =&gt; 'Area',
            'foreignKey' =&gt; 'FK_B_ID',

    );
}
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><code>OR_AREA</code> has a column titled <code>FK_B_ID</code> that refers to the <code>B_ID</code>.</p>

<p>If I run something like:</p>

<pre><code>$this-&gt;Building-&gt;find('all', array('recursive' =&gt; 2));
</code></pre>

<p>I get empty <code>[Area]</code> arrays for all the Buildings even though there are plenty of Areas in the <code>OR_AREA</code> table that are associated to buildings. Not only that, the Query Table doesn't even show CakePHP attempted to find anything but all the records in <code>OR_BLDG</code>. All the more puzzling, if I do:</p>

<pre><code>$this-&gt;Area-&gt;find('all');
</code></pre>

<p>I get all the Areas and the <code>[Building]</code> arrays are populated when appropriate. </p>

<p>What am I missing?</p>

<h2>Edit:</h2>

<p>The relevant parts of my schema:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE ORDB_ADMIN.OR_AREA
(
  A_ID            NUMBER(8),

<p>I do feel it is worthwhile to mention that I am using <strong>Oracle</strong> and I found <a href=""https://dev.cakephp.org/ticket/5939"" rel=""nofollow"">a ticket</a> that seems to describe what is happening to me but it was closed 18 months ago and no real details were provided on what was the problem/what was done to correct it.</p>

<p>I also found a comment in the ""hasMany"" section of the 1.2 CakePHP Book that reads:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If your hasMany association doesn't return any records, check if the column types of the primary key and the foreignKey are the same. If one is int and the other is char, you won't get any records from the association (and no warnings).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But, as you can see above, the key columns are NUMBERs on both ends (which is what CakePHP wants them to be for Oracle as well)</p>
","16417","","<p>Finally found out why this is happening. Although I defined my columns all uppercase in Oracle CakePHP brings them over lowercased and is unable to find them when you define your custom columns as uppercase. So changing all of my $primaryKey and foreignKey definitions to lowercase fixed my issue.</p>

<p>I opened a <a href=""http://cakephp.lighthouseapp.com/projects/42648/tickets/812-hasmany-with-a-custom-primary-key-and-a-custom-foreignkey-not-fetched-properly-in-oracle"" rel=""nofollow"">ticket</a> on this issue before finding out the reason, but I am not sure there's much to be done other than perhaps making a note in the Book so that someone doesn't waste a few days on this again :)</p>

","16417","","<p>You are misunderstanding the way that an AJAX call works. The first ""A"" in AJAX stands for asynchronous, which means that a request is made independent of the code thread you are running. That is the reason that callbacks are so big when it comes to AJAX, as you don't know when something is done until it is done. Your code, in the meantime, happily continues on.</p>

<p>In your code, you are trying to assign a variable, <code>aOrgdimensions</code> a value that you will not know until the request is done. There are two solutions to this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Modify your logic to reconcile the concept of callbacks and perform your actions once the request is done with.</p></li>
<li><p>Less preferably, make your request synchronous. This means the code and page will ""hang"" at the point of the request and only proceed once it is over. This is done by adding <code>async: false</code> to the jQuery options.</p></li>

<p>Specifying which elements will have a particular class (ie, a.class vs .class) is much faster if possible.</p>

<p>You could also pass the second argument, known as the <em>context</em> to the jQuery function to come up with:</p>

<p>I have two other jQuery calls that manipulates the data on the row, but the calls don't work on the new table rows using the AJAX call. Specifically, when a drop-down (select/option) list changes, it does an AJAX call to replace the contents of another drop-down list. Another function removes the row if you want to delete it.</p>

"<p>So I just started with jQuery and the functions are confusing me. I want to be able to just name a jQuery function and then call it, without saying when it should be called in the function. I've looked and I can't seem to understand any of the answers. My code is below:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;

        $(function() {
            $('a').click(function() {
                $('#box').slideUp();

            });
        });
    &lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I want it to do something more like this however:</p>

<pre><code>$(function slideBox() {
        $('#box').slideUp();
    });
    &lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And then call it through a OnClick event or something on a button.</p>
","16417","","<p>jQuery is just a library on top of Javascript, you can still have regular functions with jQuery code inside of them. The reason most examples are of the <code>$(function() { ... });</code> variety is because Javascript in general is heavily event-based and the most common time for you do to things with jQuery is on page load, which <code>$(function() { });</code> is a shortcut for. </p>

<p>One of the nice things about jQuery is that it lets you write unobstrusive Javascript, you really shouldn't be putting any code in the <code>onclick</code> of any HTML elements as it is a very poor practice and a maintenance nightmare. The more standard approach is:</p>

<h3>HTML</h3>

<pre><code>&lt;input type=""button"" id=""slideMeUp"" value=""Up, up, and away!""&gt;
</code></pre>

<h3>jQuery</h3>

<pre><code>$(function() {
    $('#slideMeUp').click(function() {
        $('#box').slideUp();
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>However, you could easily have something like:</p>

<pre><code>function slideMeUp() {
    $('#box').slideUp();
}

$(function() {
    // still need this outer function to indicate
    // to only bind the handler when the DOM is ready
    $('#slideMeUp').click(slideMeUp);
});

"<p>This is pretty basic but I was coding and started wondering if there was a pythonic way to check if something does not exist.  Here's how I do it if its true:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>but when I check if something does not exist, I often do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>var = 2
if var:
    print 'it exists'
else:
    print 'nope it does not'
</code></pre>

<p>Seems like a waste if all I care about is knIs there a way to check if something does not exist without the else?</p>
","16417","","<p>I think you have to be careful with your terminology, whether something <em>exists</em> and something evaluates to <em>False</em> are two different things. Assuming you want the latter, you can simply do:</p>

<pre><code>if not var:
   print 'var is False'
</code></pre>

<p>For the former, it would be the less elegant:</p>

<pre><code>try:
   var
except NameError:
   print 'var not defined'

<p>I am going to take a leap and venture, however, that whatever is making you want to check whether a variable is defined can probably be solved in a more elegant manner.   </p>

<p>I was looking through these forums today but I couldn't find a good enough answer to my question. </p>

<p>How can I stop forms being submitted to my server unless they are <strong>referred</strong> from my domain. I have realised that if somebody just copies my form HTML directly and pastes it into their own platform, the data from their form will parse through my files and do what the form is set to do on my site. </p>

<p>How can I prevent this from happening? I was thinking of checking if the referrer is from my domain, but from what I have researched this wont prevent this from happening. So how can I stop this from happening?</p>
","16417","","<p>REFERER is easily spoofed but is easy to check against so as a primary barrier of defense it is not too bad. For more sophisticated prevention, you could generate a token when the page with the form in question is loaded, store it in the user session, save it on a hidden field of the form, and when the form is submitted it check it against the session value. That can also be circumvented if someone wants to, though, so depending on what your specific case is HTTPS would then be the last resort.</p>

","16417","","<p>AJAX stands for <code>Asynchronous JavaScript and XML</code>. The key part here is really the <strong>Asynchronous</strong> part. What it means is that when you send a request to the server for information, the browser fetches the information <em>in the background</em> without interfering with the display and behavior of the existing page. Because of this, callbacks are huge when it comes to AJAX - you don't know if your server is going to take 500ms or 3s to return the value, so all you can really do is send the request and say ""when you're done, I want you to do <em>this</em>"". In your current code your server will very rarely have had time to return whatever <code>getpic.php</code> does before you try returning the value to the function. You just have to modify your code so that <code>ajaxFunction</code> can accept a second argument that is a function callback that is then run within the <code>onreadystatechange</code> part of the code.</p>

<li><code>children</code> only selects the immediate children to the element, you want <code>$('form').find('input')</code> or <code>$('form').find('input[id]')</code> to only get those that have an ID, or <code>$('form').find('input:visible')</code> to only get those that are visible (ie, not hidden.)</li>
<li>Once there, you can simply do <code>this.id</code> in the <code>each</code>. Or, through jQuery, <code>$(this).attr('id')</code>. </li>
<li>You have invalid IDs - not only do they have invalid characters, you cannot duplicate them as you do for the second input. What is the point of all the gibberish?</li>
</ul>

<p>There are many smarter ways to denote field types in your inputs if you are doing some sort of client-side validation or styling, most commonly through classes but also through custom attributes or field types in HTML5. IDs are definitely not where you want to be putting <code>booleanXXX</code> information. The HTML spec says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>ID and NAME tokens must begin with a letter ([A-Za-z]) and may be followed by any number of letters, digits ([0-9]), hyphens (""-""), underscores (""_""), colons ("":""), and periods (""."").</p>

<p>That's fine when both classes are directly applied to an element. i want to target an element with CSS that has both styles, but one style comes from the <strong><em>parent</em></strong>:</p>

<pre><code>.header { background-color:  #99FFFF; }

<p>But if a <code>div</code> is <code>contaminated</code> then i color the entire background red:</p>

<pre><code>.contaminated { background-color: Pink; }
.contaminated.header { background-color: HotPink; }

<p>I am trying to create a before and after image display using mysqli, php and html.
I am pulling the records from the db with mysqli and php, and am trying to view the results in an Unordered List using a foreach loop.</p>

<p>I have my 2 arrays which are created above in a while loop of a mysqli query. The array will only contain 5 results (for pagination, may change later).</p>

<pre><code>$before_array[] = '
&lt;div class=""highslide-gallery""&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href=""'.$beforeurl.'"" class=""highslide"" onclick=""return hs.expand(this)""&gt;
&lt;img src=""'.$beforeurl.'"" width=""100px"" height=""125px"" alt=""Highslide JS""&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;';

$after_array[] = '
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""'.$afterurl.'"" class=""highslide"" onclick=""return hs.expand(this)""&gt;
&lt;img src=""'.$afterurl.'"" width=""100px"" height=""125px"" alt=""Highslide JS""&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;';
</code></pre>

<p>and in the view of the page I have the following code to display the before and after pictures.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""hoverwrap""&gt;
&lt;ul class=""hoverbox""&gt;;

&lt;?php 
foreach ($before_array as $value) {
    echo $value; 
 }

foreach ($after_array as $value) {
  echo $value;
}
?&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- end of hoverwrap div--&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>With the current code it is displaying the pictures :
before - before - before - before - before - after - after - after - after - after.</p>

<p>Where I would like it to diplay:
before - after - before - after etc etc.</p>

<p>I was thinking a while loop but no matter which way I try and implement it, it results in a similiar display.
Any help or pointers in the right direction will be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

Most jQuery selectors are going to look like valid CSS strings, Prototype is the framework that accepts IDs without a pound sign if I remember correctly.</p>

<p>Besides that, I also really hate having full URLs in the code like that, you should try to go relative and if you can't store a webroot var globally. And I also am not a fan of so much HTML in a string (looks awful, hard to maintain/update, etc.). You should put the HTML in a hidden element in the page, or <a href=""http://ejohn.org/blog/javascript-micro-templating/"" rel=""nofollow"">inside a script tag</a>, easier that way IMO.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Starting with 1.2.0, MySQLdb disables autocommit by default, as required by the DB-API standard (PEP-249). If you are using InnoDB tables or some other type of transactional table type, you'll need to do connection.commit() before closing the connection, or else none of your changes will be written to the database.</p>
  
  <p>Conversely, you can also use connection.rollback() to throw away any changes you've made since the last commit.</p>
  
  <p>Important note: Some SQL statements -- specifically DDL statements like CREATE TABLE -- are non-transactional, so they can't be rolled back, and they cause pending transactions to commit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can call <code>db.autocommit(True)</code> to turn autocommit on for the connection or just call <code>db.commit()</code> manually whenever you deem it necessary.</p>

"<p>I have a session var for a shopping cart that reads: 'cart_b_1_1'.</p>

<p>The letter in the string indicates a category, the ints represent user id &amp; product id.</p>

<p>How can I check the category of an already set SESSION var to see if it matches the category of a new selection?</p>

<p>I am trying to make sure that if an item is added to the SESSION array and there is a var that already exists with the same category letter, then it is unset and effectively replaced with the new selection. This is to limit selections by category to one.</p>

","16417","","<p>You should consider taking advantange of the awesomeness of what associative arrays let you do:</p>

<pre><code>$_SESSION['categories'][$mycat] = array($user_id, $product_id);
</code></pre>

<p>That way whenever you set a new category it overrides the last one. Not sure why you need the <code>user_id</code> at that level, assuming the whole cart belongs to one user, my Session would look like:</p>

<pre><code>array(
    'user' =&gt; $user_id,
    'cart' =&gt; array('catid' =&gt; 'prodid', 'catid2', 'prodid2'))

<p>I have this JS function so that when I click on a checkbox, it's label is inserted into the first div. Here's what it looks like:</p>

<pre><code>$(function(){
    $('input:checkbox').click(function(){

            $('#member1').text('');   
        }
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>So one problem is the function currently has to specify which div to put it into (#member1). It's supposed to work that when the first div is ""full"", the next checkbox will insert its label into the second div, and when that one is full, the third checkbox will insert its label into the third div, etc.</p>

<p>The other issue is if a checkbox becomes unchecked, its label should be removed from its div and the labels in the divs below it should move up. Anyone know if that's possible? I'll accept help for either problem!</p>

"<p>I want to achieve something relatively simple:
I want to retrieve all objects from my model given a range of ids
(for eg, retrieve the lines 5 to 10 from a book's chapter).</p>

<p>Right now in my views.py, I've:</p>

<pre><code>def line_range(request, book_id, chapter_id, line_start, line_end):
   book_name = get_object_or_404(Book, id = book_id)
   chapter_lines = []
   for i in range (int(line_start), int(line_end)+1):
      chapter_lines .append(Line.objects.get(book = book_id, chapter = chapter_id, line = i))
return render_to_response('app/book.html', {'bookTitle': book_name, 'lines': chapter_lines })
</code></pre>

<p>Now, this is obviously not the most optimized way of doing things, as it would do n database queries, when it could be done in only one.
Is there a way of doing something like:</p>

<pre><code>def line_range(request, book_id, chapter_id, line_start, line_end):
   book_name = get_object_or_404(Book, id = book_id)
   lines_range = range (int(line_start), int(line_end)+1)
   chapter_lines = get_list_or_404(Line, book = book_id, chapter = chapter_id, line = lines_range)
return render_to_response('app/book.html', {'bookTitle': book_name, 'lines': chapter_lines })
</code></pre>

<p>This would in theory generate a much better database query (1 instead of n) and should be better performance wise.
Of course, this syntax does not work (expecting an integer, not a list).</p>

"<p>I have some trouble that comes from my Javascript (JS) codes, since I sometimes need to access the same DOM elements more than once in the same function. Some reasoning is also provided <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3254555/jquery-why-create-a-variable-for-something-youre-only-referencing-once"">here</a>.</p>

<p>From the point of view of the performance, is it better to create a jQuery object once and then cache it or is it better to create the same jQuery object at will?
Example:</p>

<pre><code>function(){
  $('selector XXX').doSomething(); //first call
  $('selector XXX').doSomething(); //second call
  ...
  $('selector XXX').doSomething(); // n-th call
}
</code></pre>

  obj.doSomething(); //first call
  obj.doSomething(); //second call
  ...
  obj.doSomething(); // n-th call       
}
</code></pre>

<p>I suppose that the answer probably depends by the value of ""n"", so assume that n is a ""small"" number (e.g. 3), then a medium number (e.g. 10) and finally a large one (e.g. 30, like if the object is used for comparison in a for cycle).</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
","16417","","<p>It is <em>always</em> better to cache the element, if n is greater than 1, cache the element, or chain the operations together (you can do <code>$('#something').something().somethingelse();</code> for <em>most</em> jQuery operations, since they usually return the wrapped set itself). As an aside, it has become a bit of a standard to name cache variables beginning with a money sign <code>$</code> so that later in the code it is evident that you are performing an operation on a jQuery set. So you will see a lot of people do <code>var $content = $('#content');</code> then <code>$content.find('...');</code> later on.</p>

&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>
","16417","","<p>IDs in HTML documents are meant to be unique. The function <code>getElementById</code> will only ever return 1 element, nothing more. For groups of similar elements, you want to give them all a common <code>class</code> and then use <code>getElementsByClassName</code> (notice the plural Elements vs Element) - this function won't work with IE 8 or earlier, however, so  if you need to support IE you would have to do <code>getElementsByTagName</code> and then filter in only those that have the class you want.</p>

<p>As far as the second part of the code, first you are setting the innerHTML to the actual string <code>newWorld()</code> not to the return value of the function (which there is none, as you are not currently returning something from within <code>newWorld</code>) - I think you meant to do <code>document.getElementById(""p1"").innerHTML = newWorld();</code>. Secondly, the random part of the code is correct and should be choosing a random planet each time. The end of the code is a bit puzzling, however - what exactly are you trying to do there? <code>worlds[whichWorld]</code> is going to be a string (<code>Earth!</code>, etc.) not a callable function. If <code>worlds</code> was an array of functions then the code would work (assuming you also returned it, since you intend to set it as the innerHTML)</p>

<p>In short, something like this would be the ""proper"" way to set all <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> elements within a parent element to a random planet:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""planets""&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hello &lt;span&gt;World!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hello &lt;span&gt;World!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hello &lt;span&gt;World!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And the Javascript:</p>

<pre><code>var spans = document.getElementById('planets').getElementsByTagName('span');
for(var i = 0; i &lt; spans.length; i++) {
    spans[i].innerHTML = randomWorld();
}

function randomWorld() {
    var worlds = [""Pluto!"", ""Mars!"", ""Saturn!"", ""Earth!"", ""Mercury!""];
    var whichWorld = Math.floor(Math.random() * worlds.length);
    return worlds[whichWorld];

"<p>So I'm trying to use the .hover() method that only does something if the element being hovered over, DOES NOT have a particular class. It works fine if I add the class to the element in question in HTML. But say I have a click event that uses .addClass() to add the class using jQuery. The hover() method then ignores the class that's been added. Enough rambling. Here is the code. </p>

    someCrap();  //when hovering a over .foo that doesn't also have the class .bar, do someCrap

    $(this).addClass('bar'); //after the element .foo gets another class .bar, the hover event written earlier continues to work, WTF

})
</code></pre>

<p>any idea guys and girls?</p>
","16417","","<p>When you run <code>$(selector).hover(fn);</code> any elements that match <em>selector</em> will have the event bound to them. If you were to add/change/remove something about the selector that later on makes that element no longer match, the event would not care because it was already bound.</p>

<p>There are a couple of ways you can handle this, and it really depends on the volume of JavaScript in your application and the specifics of your use case.</p>

<p>1) You could use <em>event delegation</em>, which takes advantage of the way that JavaScript events bubble to allow you to bind an event to a parent element of a particular part of your page and do logic at the time in which the event happens - this is very useful for a couple of reasons. One, imagine you have a table with 100 records and a link with a class of <code>edit</code> that should fire a particular JavaScript function when someone clicks on it. If you do <code>$('a.edit').click(fn);</code> jQuery will end up binding 100 different events to the individual elements. This can start to make your application struggle in older machines/browsers. Secondly, it makes it so that when things change dynamically (either you added a new row to the table or removed the edit class from a link because you no longer want to allow a particular row to be editable) your event is smart enough to know what is going on and still work. In jQuery, you use the <code>.on()</code> function for this. Read up on the <a href=""http://api.jquery.com/on/"" rel=""nofollow"">documentation</a>. If you have earlier versions of jQuery you might have to use <code>.delegate()</code> and if you are running some really old jQuery functions you are looking for <code>.live()</code>.</p>

<p>2) A simpler approach if your application is relatively small is to simply bind the event to all <code>.foo</code> elements and check within the event itself if the element currently has a class of <code>bar</code> and proceed if it doesn't.</p>

","16417","","<p>The code is correct; the reason it is not working is because the way you have the jsfiddle set up. On the right side where it asks for a framework/where you want your JS to show up, you have jQuery and onLoad (the defaults, I believe) - this makes it so that the resulting code of your fiddle looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type='text/javascript'&gt;//&lt;![CDATA[ 
$(window).load(function(){

   if (document.getElementById(shID)) {

<p>A couple of notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Chaining in jQuery is super powerful and avoids re-querying the DOM if you are going to do multiple things with the same element. You could likewise store the results of a jQuery search doing something like <code>var $div = $('#' + thisID);</code> - in either case, you just don't want to do the same selector over and over.</li>
<li>IDs are supposed to be unique in the document, so I am assuming there is only one element with an ID of ""elo-1"" in the document. If that's true, which it should be, doing a complicated selector like <code>'#mainBdy div[id^=""'+thisID+'""]'</code> is just stopping jQuery from being able to use the native <code>getElementById</code> which is  a gallizion times more effective (not to mention cleaner).</li>
<li>As you can see, <code>css</code> accepts an object so you don't have to call it more than once. I would personally simply add a class to the menu item and handle the style in my stylesheet. It is much easier from a maintainability standpoint.</li>

","16417","","<p>I cannot answer what is happening differently without seeing your HTML, but <code>:even</code> is not the same as <code>nth-child(2)</code> - perhaps you want <code>nth-child(2n)</code>?</p>

<p>If your HTML looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;a&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;b&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;c&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Running this code:</p>

<pre><code>$('li:even').each(function() { console.log($(this).text()); });
</code></pre>

<p>Would log ""a"", ""c"", ""e"", ""2"", ""4"" - it simply takes all the matching elements and gives you every other one.</p>

<p>While this code:</p>

<pre><code>$('li:nth-child(2)').each(function() { console.log($(this).text()); });
</code></pre>

<p>Would log ""b"", ""2"" - only the 2nd child of each parent.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>But the link is just set to <code>undefined</code>. What am I doing wrong here?</p>
","16417","","<p>To be able to get a value relative to each element and then create an anchor tag you can't simply chain the operation like you have. There needs to be some sort of iteration done so you can then scope each specific paragraph and get the relative link. Most of the time you could use <a href=""http://api.jquery.com/each/"" rel=""nofollow""><code>each</code></a> for this, but <a href=""http://api.jquery.com/append/#append-functionindex--html"" rel=""nofollow""><code>append</code></a> happens to support a function as its argument, which then needs to return what you will be adding to each element. Within this context you can then resolve what the h2's link is and return the new anchor.</p>

<pre><code>$('p.desc').append(function() { // loop through all p.desc and add something
    // within this function, $(this) is now the current p.desc
    var link = $(this).prev('h2').find('a').attr('href'); // get the path
    return $('&lt;a/&gt;').attr('href', link).text('More'); // return the new link

"<p>While reading the jQuery <a href=""http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/jquery-object/"" rel=""nofollow"">documentation about the jQuery object</a> I came upon this line:  </p>

<p>Alternatively, because the jQuery object is ""array-like,"" it supports array subscripting via brackets:</p>

<pre><code>// Selecting only the first 'h1' element on the page (alternate approach)
var firstHeaderElem = $(""h1"")[ 0 ];

    $(""button"").click(
    function()
    {
        t.fadeOut();
    });
});

<p>It doesn't work. Is this because using array notation doesn't really return a jQuery object, thus the methods are not available?</p>
","16417","","<p>When you use the array notation you are getting the native DOM elements back, not the jQuery ""wrapped set"". Your example would work if you did <code>$(t).fadeOut();</code> instead. If you wanted to get the first result of a set without shedding the jQuery goodness, you would do <code>$('p').eq(0);</code></p>

"<p>I have two buttons ""Save"" and ""Close"".
I need the Close button to ask a question whether the user wants to save before it redirects back to the main page. The below code shows what I want to accomplish.</p>

  if(confirm(""CloseWarning"")) {
    $('#saveButton').click();
    window.location.href = ""main.html"";
  } else {
    window.location.href = ""main.html"";
  }
});
</code></pre>

<p>However the issue is that the saveButton click event doesn't have enough time to finish before the entire page redirects. So my question is what's the best way to do a callback in this situation so that save button is clicked and then we redirect to the main page.</p>
","16417","","<p>You can pass data to events when you trigger them, so you could do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>$('#closeButton').click(function(e) {
    if(confirm('..')) {
         $('#saveButton').trigger('click', [true]);
    } else {
         window.location.href = ""main.html"";
    }

$('#saveButton').click(function(e, close) {
    // do saving stuff ..
    // for normal clicks ""close"" will be undefined, otherwise close when done
    if(close) {
        window.location.href = ""main.html"";
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>If you wanted to be more <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself"" rel=""nofollow"">DRY</a> about it, you could have the closing code in the saveButton be a similar trigger to the closeButton with a <code>force</code> variable of sorts that would force the close, so you would not repeat the redirect URL in two different parts of the code.</p>

<p>If you can't modify your Save logic (which seems like a questionable thing, but okay...) you could do this, assuming the Save logic consists of a single AJAX call and you don't have any other AJAX requests firing off. If you did, you can check the <code>settings</code> variable to make sure its the right one before you close:</p>

Then you can sort by the name you give it. The <code>select_related()</code> is so that the join is done in 1 query, I am not sure what the table names are but you can take it from there...</p>

"<p>I have a model like this:</p>

    seen = models.BooleanField()
    ...

    def set_seen(self):
        self.seen = True
        self.save()
</code></pre>

<p>Then I have this code in a views.py function:</p>

<pre><code>m_not_seen = M.objects.filter(seen=False)
m_seen = M.objects.filter(seen=True)

for m in m_not_seen:
    m.set_seen()

<p>After the last line is executed, it seems like m_seen is updated automatically to include all the entries that were in ""not seen"" previously. I don't want the queryset to be updated. Is this possible?</p>
","16417","","<p>Django querysets are lazy, as the <a href=""https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/querysets/#when-querysets-are-evaluated"" rel=""nofollow"">documentation</a> says: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Internally, a QuerySet can be constructed, filtered, sliced, and generally passed around without actually hitting the database. No database activity actually occurs until you do something to evaluate the queryset.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In your case, writing <code>m_seen = M.objects.filter(seen=True)</code> does not go to the database until you start looping through it or whatever it is you end up doing with it. At that point, the not seen ones have already been updated to seen.</p>

<p>The documentation goes on to talk about <a href=""https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/querysets/#pickling-querysets"" rel=""nofollow"">pickling</a> and other ways you can force a QuerySet to be evaluated. In your case, you probably just want to call <code>list()</code> on the QuerySet, just be aware that this will load all the results into memory. </p>

"<p>I've been banging my head on this for hours and can't figure out why this won't work. I've got two li's with id's of 1_userType and 2_userType.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li id=""1_userType""&gt;User Type 1&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=""2_userType""&gt;User Type 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I have a ternary that says if a value is true remove a class of muted and if it is false it will add a class of muted.</p>

<pre><code>val === true ? $('ul li#1_userType, ul li#2_userType').removeClass('muted') : $('ul li#1_userType, ul li#2_userType').addClass('muted');
</code></pre>

<p>Except this doesn't add or remove the class no matter if it returns true or false. The strange thing is I can add a console.log('true') or console.log('false') in the ternary and it hits one or the other. This isn't making sense to me. Any help is appreciated! </p>
","16417","","<p>You probably just want to do (<a href=""http://api.jquery.com/toggleClass/#toggleClass-className-switch"" rel=""nofollow"">documentation</a>):</p>

<pre><code>$('#1_userType, #2_userType').toggleClass('muted', val === true);
</code></pre>

<p>Adding the <code>ul li</code> in there is unnecessary since lookups by IDs (which should be unique in a document) can be done via the native getElementById method. Also, <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/types.html#type-name"" rel=""nofollow"">valid element IDs - before HTML5 - should not begin with numbers</a>, although I don't think that's why your code is not working.</p>

"<p>I have an HTML table that I am using jQuery UI sortable on and it is working just fine to allow me to drag and drop the row order in the table. I need to prevent certain rows from being sorted.

","16417","","<p>Like I said in my comment, I normally use the <code>beforeStop</code> method when I want to cancel a sorting event based on some criteria. For example, I have a bunch of lists in one application and I want to be able to sort between them but not amongst them, and this can sometimes change on the fly. So I have something that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>$('#some_list').sortable({
    ...,
    beforeStop: function(e, ui) {
        if($(ui.item).closest('ul')[0] === this) { // don't allow within this
